66,"i had this problem occasionally with my 360 controller before it broke. bear in mind, the rest of what follows is because of this problem: the controller itself is player 2 (not just in game; your gamepad may not display this information). if this is not your problem you may want to stop reading.

occasionally, unplugging the controller from the pc and reconnecting it (it was wired; i'd assume unpairing it and re-pairing it if it's wireless) fixed the issue. if that did not fix the issue, then a simple restart of the pc was required. after the restart, it was usually fine, but in some cases the controller was still player 2. in order to fix this issue, when restarting, you need to plug the controller in while the pc is booting up (before it reads that there is a keyboard attached). 

i leave my pc on during the day (it just goes to sleep), and half the time when i get home, the controller is player 2. since i've gotten an xbox one controller, that problem is gone. occasionally it will be player 2, but unplugging and replugging fixes the issue. hope this helped.",-0.6705,0.069,0.899,0.032

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

180,"well, i always go for boost on kickoff (assuming i'm not the one kicking off). there are two main reasons for this.

1. i've gone for boost more often than not going for boost, so if i cheat, i'm now in unfamiliar territory, which, if in a 2v2, may result in a goal anyway.
2. unless the teammate kicking off just kills the ball, i don't see any harm in going for the boost. besides, two flips and you're still at 80 and almost at the ball.

now, in the scenarios above, not all the possibilities are included (i only included the best ones). there are tradeoffs to each, but i've noticed that in a 2v2, most of the time you kickoff against the same person. so red a usually kicks off against blue a, and red b usually kicks off against blue b. assuming this is the case, usually people don't vary their kickoffs too much (unlike in 1s), so if you notice after two goals that your teammate kills the ball on kickoff, chances are, the next kickoff will also result in a killed ball, so cheating would be a much better option. vice versa, if your teammate usually gets the ball to roll up one of the walls, you can get corner boost while letting him get side boost. 

my advice may be incorrect, and may be one of the reasons why i am still in champ 2. i'll take suggestions if my opinion on this is completely wrong.",-0.1389,0.091,0.799,0.11

182,"going for boost, staying and grabbing a few pads, or cheating and grabbing a few pads are all good options on kickoff. personally, i mix it up between all 3 options depending on the game situation. my only recommendation is do what your comfortable with. keep in mind you are probably disproportionately remembering the bad outcomes on kickoff because as humans we tend to remember negative outcomes more than positive ones.",0.2449,0.129,0.718,0.153

if you're getting into matches tired, not focused, tilted by previous experiences, feeling hopeless about teammates even before queuing, just don't play. wait for a day when you're feeling rested, approaching matches in a positive way, and focused on winning.

i can imagine you were d3 div4, got ""bad teammates"", got tilted by it and this brought all the downswing you see in the graph. this can carry on even to the next session, when you remember how awful the previous experience was and you get into the game hopeless, but play for the grind anyway",-0.7939,0.155,0.771,0.074

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

401,"the first challenge is not good. if he was plat he would�ve clearly beaten you and scored an open net. you can tell because he�s closer to the ball and jumps first. 

you then go all the way into the corner when the opponent has the ball. if he were to catch and dribble he would easily get behind you and score since you are not covering the net at all. 

he throws it away to you so you have time to set up a dribble but instead hit it softly into the mid where a plat would�ve scored an open net. (lol jk nobody scored open nets)

he can�t get around to it so he doesn�t get a shot on and you smack the ball at the wall giving away possession where you could�ve gone for a dribble. 

the ball bounces middle and you decide to go even though again the opponent clearly should be able to beat you to it again. same reasons as before. you get lucky he misses and get a goal.

ones is all about possession watch some pro 1v1 and how often they catch the ball instead of booming it. you also seem to be much better at aerialing than your opponent so work on decision making and you should climb a bit.",0.936,0.026,0.881,0.093

467,"well in terms of internet connectivity there are a few things.

first there's your router to the isp and then isp to psyonix servers. if you think your internet is fine that is probably what you're referring to. remember that high download / upload doesn't necessarily mean good internet. try testing your ping, see if you have any latency variation.

next big thing would be the connection from your computer to your router. try connecting via ethernet cable - if the problem goes away then you know it's either the signal your router is producing or your wifi chip.

1) why is it bad going for boost, instead of the ball? i heard a lot of people and youtubers saying that you don't have to go for boost over the ball, but they never say or explain why. there are situations that you need boost, for example when the enemy team shoots the ball towards your goal, and if you have 0 boost, it's impossible to save the ball because you need to fly to catch it.

2) i'm in plat 1, and i need to start training to improve in this game. and i don't know where to start, if i practice dribbling, air dribbling, powershots, etc. (at least i know how to halflip)

thank you.",0.9349,0.053,0.781,0.167
583,"generally boost over ball is meant that a player leaves the play (such as leaving the net wide open) to get 100 boost, when just 1 or 2 pads would suffice to make the save.

for training start with ground shots by poquito in the browse tab, and hit the ball around in freeplay a lot, challenge yourself to go for reads you aren't comfortable and try to make clean contact",0.8833,0.035,0.772,0.193
584,"boost over ball can be a little confusing. essentially, it means that each player has a role to play and that their role is more important than boost at any given moment. boost is a role-adjacent and shouldn't be considered part of your responsibility at any time; it's something that you collect when the play allows it, or when it's part of your natural rotation. so, when people talk about it, they're just saying that it's not okay to abandon your role to get more boost. for example, if it's my job to defend the goal, i'm going to stick to that role as long as i feel it's an imminent threat. if i can't get boost and still be in position to defend the goal - or if i even think that going for boost might hinder my ability - then getting boost is the wrong decision. you can defend almost anything with 0 boost  and defending with 0 boost is better than not defending at all.

>i'm in plat 1, and i need to start training to improve in this game. and i don't know where to start, if i practice dribbling, air dribbling, powershots, etc. (at least i know how to halflip)

train what's fun for you and develop into the type of player you want to develop into. improvement is improvement. i was gc for several years before i finally learned how to half-flip last season because it's not an essential skill. it can be useful, sure, but it's not essential. i would recommend working on powershots, though, for sure. big clears will win you games.",0.9827,0.034,0.785,0.181

interface settings: turn up the nameplate scale. i have mine at 130.

791,"yes. yes. finally someone said it. 

from a mathematics perspective, individual elo for a team-based game doesn't work the way it's intended to. i've thought about this a lot.

the problem is that in a decent rl team, there can be slight role variations. think about nrg squishy, his job on the team is a support player, not to get the flashy goals. 

i waited on my 3s placement matches until last week - and for some reason was playing with gold players (not sure how that works) for some of my placements. i won most of the matches, but lost a few due to being completely dumfounded by my teammates. as much as this subreddit will say ""you're just bad"", there's nothing you can do about a teammate that gets < 10 points. there is a limit to the carry.

moreover, personal performance is based on your ability to work in the team, to be a cog in the machine. at our normal ranks, we have a good idea of what our teammates can do, and can trust them to do certain things. as example, in low diamond, i can trust my teammate to hit the aerial while i rotate to grab boost. in low-plat/gold, my teammate will likely miss the ball as it rolls into our goal - and i shouldn't rotate so i can make the easy save. 

so when you're not at your correct rank you're going to be confused, because you have no idea what everyone is capable of. i am hesitant to push too far up because my teammates can't make the same saves that i can. so i end up playing more defensively. moreover i find that i'm unable to read the game entirely, if i don't know what my teammate is doing, or if i can't trust them to hit a shot, then i won't know where to position myself. 

it's not just you, it's the results of an imperfect system.

i have a b.s. degree in mathematics, and would love to tinker with the elo formula. i'd probably test how a performance based metric works - but then also rework how in-game score is calculated too. 

but low-key if you want to queue dm me and we can break the plats. i'm a diamond tournament winner.",0.9935,0.055,0.777,0.168
792,"precisely. now, i�m not a fool. i�m very aware a ball chaser can score a ton of points, make mvp for the team, and still be a terrible player. that�s not me. i routinely score 600-800 points while my team has around 50-200. i don�t chase the ball, i play more conservatively and i�m decent at rotations. i mind what my teams doing, i consider their boosts, and the opponents boosts. i don�t want to too my own horn, but i�m good at rocket league. i�m better than a fucking plat 3. if i have a team i can make high champs look stupid and i�ve beaten countless gcs. the problem is being a good player is not rewarded like it should be. i�m getting bad rng routinely and it�s killing me.",-0.9145,0.2,0.65,0.15
793,"honestly if you�re a champ player in a plat lobby, you should just be faster. so you gotta just carry your way back into at least d2 before you can really trust your teammates. so play defensively, but be quick enough to capitalize on all the mistakes you�ll see in those lobbies. you got this, with 2k hrs you�ll get it back.",0.4148,0.07,0.789,0.141

797,"i am p3 and this shit is so inconsistent. sometimes ppl are really good sometimes i just sit there wondering how we are the same bracket. unfortunately i am not good enough to carry and i would never even compare myself to a champ player. but i peaked diamond and played in d2 lobbies without much problems. i can relate as i am also more a support player, giving more passes than shots on goals. but once the ball bounce in front the goal no plat teammate is to be seen. so i understand your struggle. 

but as a champ player you shouldn't really have troubles to get out of it. as others mentioned: you are probably to fast for your mates in this rank. so  focus on less support like passing and more direct goal shots and defense. let your mates jump weirdly around in front of the enemy goal while you hold the defense line. in p3 usually ppl  give jack squat about rotation and if you can consistently get distance shots from your third of the field on the enemy goal, combined with air dribble, you will win most games easy, becuase not just your team mates have shit rotation: your enemy team as well",0.948,0.13,0.665,0.206

we gave up an one goal lead to trail 3-1 and i was at fault for all three goals. annoyed at my own mistakes and in full on anticipation of getting shit for it from my teammate, i offered a forfeit. 90 seconds on the clock, nothing was working offensively. to my surprise, my teammate reacted to the forfeit by saying ""we can"". so i decided ""fuck it, if they're not giving up, i'm going mental and give absolutely everything in this last minute"".


so i immediately got a lucky goal and my teammate kept it up with the motivational speech. we both got miraculous saves and somehow i ended up getting the equalizer after all. we nearly won it before overtime, but whatever. in overtime, again, we both had epic saves to prevent losing the game still, but in the end, we managed to win the game and it really was marginal how i got that last one in.

in the post-game chat, i told them they were right for not giving up and thanked them for it. i've experienced many toxic moments on this game, but i was really happy that someone decided to be uplifting for a change and more so, that i managed to reward them for their faith by winning the game. that message of encouragement motivated the shit out of me and i'm glad i saved the clip because it's honestly a special game for me, sounds a bit weird, but that's okay. i don't think i'll forget it anytime soon, so random person: thanks again.",0.9937,0.078,0.698,0.223

990,i would keep using the controller. if your new to the game i would just hop into free play and practice hitting the ball with ball cam on and off. once you get a feel for that try flipping into the ball. a lot of players put air roll and drift on (l1/lb) and an air roll either left or right on (r1/rb) i play claw like a weirdo so i just left drift where it is. if hitting the ball becomes too easy start to look into rotations. you don�t need to work on anything fancy yet just get in the fundamentals,0.8658,0.026,0.847,0.127

try these: (from pro player squishy)

- fov: 110

- swivel: 4.20

interstellar is in the shop too, but i won't be touching this with a 10-foot pole, as i'm biased against it and i'm not the guy to talk to about ""what makes interstellar a worthy buy from the shop or not""

saffron playock from the preview imo looks very clean. however being a clean wheel and a ""clean wheel that doesn't look hideous"" are two very different things.

battle stars collectors, if you don't have burnt sienna yet, good news, you are getting it now!

wtf is leviathan? i know it's an import and probably animated decal from the image above, but i've literally never heard of this, or maybe i've heard of it like once... lol. my guess? probably overpriced and ugly. but take the latter with a  grain of salt.

grey x-tempo is probably not the best color to buy directly from the shop, even if it might be worth the price. which it is because for no reason at all grey x tempo is unobtainable? what

1392,"nothing surprising here. 500 hrs for d3 is probably average pace or around it. if you don't 'train', i'd recommend doing so. check out some shot packs, and maybe even workshop maps. personally, i think most people around your rank tend to struggle most with ground control and taking meaningful shots. i think if you spent a good amount of time dribbling in freeplay, and took advantage of some involved shot packs, such as those by poquito for example, you'd be off to a good start. don't forget to do them often though. kobe didn't get such a good 3-point shot by only shooting during games.


also, take a week off from competitive play. burnout is real, and you'd be surprised how beneficial a week to decompress is in regards to your gameplay. you'll feel impatient, but focus on yourself and come back to it. not enough people take a small break, and you'd probably benefit greatly from it.

1393,"d3 in 500 hours is better than average, if it makes you feel better. 

real talk though, it�s more likely your positioning that�s the problem at this stage in your rl journey than your mechanics, though it might be a mix of both. what helped me was focusing on what�s going to be happening 2-3 seconds later rather than whatever i see happening in real time. speed isn�t just about how fast your car moves mechanically. as you get into higher ranks, its moreso about how well you can predict where the ball will end up next.",0.6369,0.027,0.896,0.078

1395,"yeah, take a week off or something. i could take a guess for what's wrong but my guess is if you made it to diamond anything you'll be able to tell where you're weak in gameplay. it's being clouded by the tilt. 

take that break and when you come back do an hour session in free play with the classic hit the ball as hard as you can as fast as you can as many times as you can. try to be aware of anything that feels particularly stiff and awkward and write it down to work on later. go into casual and play normally but take notes the same way and again in a competitive match when you're all warmed up.

review your notes later and look for what you can improve on. if something is showing up in 2 or 3 of those 3 scenarios i listed then you need to work on that. 

also, play slower and control the ball. if you control the ball you control the game. throw on some bots and practice spotting and flicking when challenges come in. i can tell i am in a slump because i stop ""seeing"" how to play around my opponents. 

lastly, think of the things you learned in lower ranks. plays tend to repeat with modifications at various levels. for example, you learned in goldish not to smash the ball off the wall in your half because the second man has a clean shot. so you instead do what? and when you do that, what does the opponent typically do? how do you respond and maintain possession? just thinking about these scenarios is a really good way to develop game sense without the pressure of competition. 

at the end of it all, it sounds like you just need a break. d3 is a killer accomplishment and the fact that you feel any other way about it tells me you're being overly competitive and just need to relax and appreciate how far you've come. and i don't mean that as an insult, truly you're doing good shit.",0.987,0.08,0.75,0.17

also, i think you can access the workshop even on epic - i would recommend the dribbling challenge v2 overhaul. very good for practicing soft ball control.

as a technical detail, playing on a large screen is a huge advantage, and always keep your fps as high as possible, even if your monitor refresh rate is low. the higher the fps, the lower the input lag.

the camera settings shouldn't be hard to adjust to, and the added resolution will be nice but not the most prominent thing you notice. if you're looking for a controller, i'd recommend xbox or ps4/5. when i switched to pc, i initially continued using a third party wired switch pro controller, and it held me back a bit.",0.9393,0.039,0.806,0.155

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

1833,"hey, i'm only just scraping into plat 1 in all ranked standard playlists so i'm not exactly a wizard at the game. but i've been playing for around a year now, so not completely brand new (but i've come a long way since being a bronze newbie).

my question is how to handle the situation where you rotate back to 3rd man but your team mate is sat miles back in net despite our team being on offence? or you fall in behind and they simply don't push forward either at all, or far too slowly allowing the opposition to be down our throats, even though myself and our other team mate have already dropped back or in a comfortable position heading back. leaving a near constant 2v3.

after a few failed attempts and constant pressure being applied to us as a result i often feel like i must cut rotation way too often in order to pressure the ball or cut out something the opposition are baring down on whilst the 3rd man dithers. 

as i solo queue most of the time, and often just pick up the game for an odd hour here and there quite regularly rather than single huge grinding sessions, i tend to play a lot of casual. i don't seem to run into this issue anywhere near as much playing this weirdly. there seems to be a lot more fluidity with rotations and people drop back into the mid 3rd more allowing team pressure to actually be effective.

the tl,dr is am i being overly ball chasey or do i have a legitimate gripe? i've played enough matches to know when we're going to be able to get away with the last man doing this and when we're likely to get destroyed as a result and feel compelled to intervene. i know it's low level and nobody is going to be an ace at plat 1 but it's super frustrating and often just hastens my retreat back to casual.",-0.5122,0.112,0.783,0.105
1834,"i don't know if i'm ranked highly enough yet to give advice but i'll give it a go.

the simplest and most annoying answer is to get better so you can better carry your teams to wins. this advice is similar to my actual advice in that carrying a team will generally be you speeding around, getting to the ball first, and making good plays. 

as a short term piece of advice, i would say that taking matters into your own hands isn't a terrible way to go but is not something to rely on, as tm8s are important and, even when you can get to the ball first, making ill advised hits because you cut rotation at a weird angle instead of letting the tm8 shoot or clear will kill you. 

in the circumstance that the tm8 is always back, and you try to make it clear that you are not ballchasing and thus he is able to come forward without worrying and he still sits back, then i would say put the team on your back a bit more and cut rotations or play more like it's a 2v3. 

that's my 2 cents but i know this is tough because playing people 2v3 isn't very easy.

also maybe just play 2s more if you don't queue with a team because it's one less variable to deal with.

edit: xe_os added something i forgot to explicitly say which is that sometimes ""rotation"" doesn't mean go in a circle, just that there is someone filling each role and there is an understanding of who is next to what job. if you are attacking and can get to the ball with a good hit faster than a teammate, you aren't really cutting rotation.",0.9523,0.101,0.741,0.158
1835,"if you see your mate sitting in net/taking back boost when your team has offensive pressure, yes you should cut rotation, at least if you have a decent enough angle. cutting rotation is not inherently bad. you should not cut rotation if you have a mate ready to go for the ball with a better angle than you, but if your mate is too far behind to reach it, you should cut to keep the pressure. 

many players in lower ranks are convinced their mates are all ballchasers but it's just that they are way too passive themselves. that's one of the reason higher rank players move the camera around, it's to check whether they have a mate ready to go or not. if they have no mate in position to challenge, then they cut rotation to challenge it themselves ; otherwise they just rotate behind their mate, gathering some boost.",0.5065,0.126,0.723,0.151
1836,"right. i appreaciate your frustration. 

but.

pressuring is subjective. 

experianced players quite often sit further back, especially in lower ranks, due to *their* experiance of cutters and ball chasers. (not saying you are one, just offering up a alternative viewpoint).

there is a tactical game to be had by letting the opposition play onto the offensive ball. an experianced player can judge the play, catch a bounce, run it onto the wall and play the corner, get boost and an over commit hoping that their teammates have positioned for goal defence. 

there is a school of tactical positional play that requires you, as a team mate not you personally, to understand when to leave balls and rotate wide, off the ball, collect boost and reposition. this allows your defensive team mate time and space to play with the goal at their back, making a challenge and knowing someone is behind covering the goal. 

constant pressure is a nightmare to play with when trying to dial in a good rotation and it often denotes a simple lack of awareness as to team mates positioning. 

a overly defensive teammate, whilst it may not be seen as a 'good' way to play is often a learned defence mechanism against constant on the ball playing. 

if you do have these players in your team, they are waiting for your trust. allow them to see that you are accomodating them, open up the ball, let them commit without seeing an empty goal, or that you are on their arse double commiting. 

basic ball game tactics are to always be where a team mate isnt. sure, accidents happen and rotations can fail. but if you habitually find yourself in the same position as a team mate, the setup is wrong. 

the only place teammates should share ground is goal defence. and even then priority discapline is a hard learned skill. 

your team mates have a gamestyle. it may not be the same as yours, but thats not to say its wrong. you may not gel with them, but they still are valid members of the team. 

i think you would be pleasantly surprised by game development of you showed your team mates you can allow them into the game.",0.9861,0.086,0.738,0.177
1837,"it's good that you have a habit for checking if your 3rd man is in position take his turn after you finish your play. it is annoying when they aren't ready but there are some things you can do. remember that part of ranking up is becoming adaptable and covering for your team's mistakes, such as this example.

if you make a play as 1st man, you should always be hesitant to go for the ball again even if you think the third man is too far back. imagine you just left the opponents' corner as 1st man, 2nd man makes a play quickly and 3rd man isn't ready to follow. if you cut now and get outplayed (which is likely since you need to turn around), 3rd man is in a 1v2/1v3 situation, which is worse than just losing your attack. 

a safer alternative to cutting rotation when 3rd man is too far back is to simply position yourself in the center of the field and shadow your opponents counter attack, basically delaying your rotation to buy time. stay close but don't dive in unless you are 100% winning the ball and keeping possession, it's not enough to just challenge one opponent for another to get the ball in this scenario. the most important thing is to be ready to block an infield pass which is the best way to score on a defender who has isolated themselves by staying too far back (they may also try to go for a rebound off your backboard but you can save it by going for it as if you were taking the shot but purposefully missing). try to force them to play the ball into the corner and your third man should be ready by that point. 

if you make a play as 2nd man and no one follows, i guess your team mates should be covering the counter attack as i described above so if you can somehow catch up and mess up your opponents play by bumping or challenging the ball then that would almost always be the best thing to do.

as a side note: playing casual can be tempting but i would encourage you to stick to ranked if you want to see improvement. if you go through a long period of playing ranked consistently, when you go to casual you will be bored from the lack of quality in the games. hopet his helps.",0.9192,0.124,0.725,0.151

plats also suck with 50\50s, you can often just ram through / mindgame 1 player if you do it right.

if the ball is in the corner and your opponent is there first, sometimes it's good to wait for them to kindof pass it to you. often you'll have to be on the sidewall for that.
also, try to save some boost (or even steal the corner boost), because often the opponents will get possession and you need to rotate back fast.",0.5719,0.052,0.871,0.077

i usually try to push on throught until i either get the ball out of the corner for mates or until i lose control of the ball. its often better to have 1 guy struggle through their defence than to sacrifice second man to come in and ""help "" you out in their corner. this is based on you not having moment or boost. if you stay there for a bit most of the  time someone in the opponnents team will try to bail teammates out on defence and thats why its good if none of your mates have yolo'd into the corner with you. you will have a better chance at pressuring their defence and break them out of rotation. but thats my two cents

1841,"i typed up a long response but my best advice, having had the same issue but not only don't notice it being a problem as much, but i also went from d1ish to c1d3 in about two months. i'll try to shorten it.

my long term advice is to spend time in training perfecting the simpler stuff. the better you can control your car (driving, keeping speed, powerslide, fixing your car before landing, fixing aerials, shot placement, dribbling, etc), the more time you will have to think about how to proceed because you're faster, but you also sort of give yourself more of an ability to think about what to do because your muscle memory is taking care of the ""i need to move like this and do a side flip with the side corner to get it to do x"" while your brain can look at where the other team is, where your tm8 is, etc. 

the point of this is that you will get so much more comfortable that you will find everything in the game more intuitive because it's not a blind/random move but a calculated touch decided on after assessing the pitch and making a plan. 

my short term advice is work on dribbling at the same time that you work the corner in free play by taking it into the corner and trying things (even if it's random) and then controlling the ball around to do it again and again.

edit: my other response was longer sorry lol",0.9909,0.018,0.834,0.149
1842,"my advice would be slightly different to what others have told you. a 50/50 in the corner almost always favours the team in defence. in fact as a defender, taking 50/50s in the corner is one of the best strategies for giving your team a chance to position correctly and collect boost.

if you are attacking, you don't really want to throw yourself into any 50/50, you will likely lose your momentum, the ball will still be in the corner and now you will take longer to rotate out and be ready for another play.

the most important thing to realise is that just because you have the ball in the opponent's corner doesn't mean you have to instantly create a scoring chance for your team by doing an amazing air dribble or something. a much more consistent way to score is through boost starving and constant pressure - that means not taking yourself out of the play uneccessarily. if you have the ball in their corner and you really can't do anything with it, just hit the ball at an awkward angle so your opponent can't easily control the ball for free and try to get a bump or boost steal. keep as much momentum as you can so you can instantly drive in a straight line to the midfield without using much boost and be ready to jump back in after your team follows you up. if you are above 30 boost you won't need to go into your own half to get more. eventually some space will open for someone to make a good pass or dribble play, you don't have to always make a great play from the corner.",0.9907,0.059,0.743,0.199

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

if it�s the second continue what your doing but reduce the work load - 1 hour of freeplay?! that way to much. just practice till you feel consistent with your touches. play 1s, it�s a great way to become more consistent and independent. watch pros or higher ranks play, cause you�ll know what possible to be more creative which gives you an advantage. and finally save your replay once in a while and watch it, see where you can implement changes and try to execute that in game - might take a while to get used to it, but it�ll help down the line.",0.9889,0.0,0.786,0.214

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 2. behavioral guidelines

we want r/rocketleague to be a friendly and welcoming community. rocket league is a game that attracts people from all ages and all backgrounds and as a result it is important that our users behave in a mature manner at all times. do not spam, harass, insult, or use hate-speech at any time towards other users, even if it is in a jokingly manner.

discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and similar bigotry are not tolerated on the subreddit. wishing harm on others or encouraging self-harm or suicide, as well as the aforementioned behavior, is grounds for an immediate permanent ban from the subreddit without warning.

2666,"> except that the lower ranked person would not be boosted. most matchups rank with the person that's highest on the team. 

normally i never play ranked with lower-ranked friends, but when they play with their mates who are lower ranked and win a game, the lower-ranked would go up 3-4 divisions from one win as the elo gap is so large, so the game is trying to compensate by getting that player to the ""correct"" rank of the others in the party when winning.

>  chances are very slim that a champ 1 and silver 2 are matched with a respctive champ 1 and silver 2. most of the time this will end up being two champs, or champ 1 and a teammate somewhere in diamond. 

obviously, chances are very slim, but when it does happen it's very frustrating and annoying. the restrictions would obviously stop this from happening.

>  so the person ""carrying"" their lower ranked teammate would have to 2v1 their already evenly matched opponents, and win, in order rank themselves higher as well as carry their teammate. 

yes, they would constantly have to 2v1 their already evenly matched opponents, however, you can come up against a team of 3 in 3v3 where one is diamond 2, the other is silver 1 and the other is gold 2.. logically it just doesn't make any sense whats so ever as it would never happen in a real competitive scene world... so just applying restrictions would just make sense and stop this from happening. if they want to play with their friend, that's what casual is for.",0.9926,0.091,0.69,0.218
2669,">this stops players from boosting up their ""not so good"" friends from lower ranks into higher ranks and ruining gameplay for other players . as well as this, if this 'not so good' friend goes into solo queue after getting boosted, that team is automatically at a disadvantage.

it doesn't work like this, the lower players will be measured to be pretty much as good as the best player of the party, so a party with huge differences in mmr are actually the onces having a harder time. also this means they won't win most of their matches, so the lower ranked player doesn't get boosted and hasn't to play with/against people of higher skills than him afterwards when i solo queues again.

>the reason i feel this should be applied to rocket league is because i have played countless amount of games of me trying to rank up in 3v3's solo queuing (yes, i know it is my fault for solo queuing) where there would be a party of 2 and me in the 3v3, and the party of 2 would include an individual at my rank (diamond 2) and then a gold or silver, so it's me (d2), and the other two (d1/2) and (silver/gold).

while this really sucks as the solo queue player in this case, it doesn't have an impact on you not ranking up, instead it is even an advantage for you to rank up easier since:

the chances that you are in the team with the 2s party are far lower than the chances that you play against them in such matchups, so overall you mostly take profit out of such scenarios every time you are not in that team.",0.4655,0.136,0.723,0.142

this totally makes sense i get what you mean here, and the person in the party is 100% at a disadvantage, but let's say you are one game away from diamond or one game away from champ and you're feeling really good and playing really well and then boom, you've got a gold player on your team.. not only are you more likely to lose, but it's also going to ruin your morale and get you frustrated, even if you don't get mad and you do lose the game you may then go on a losing streak and then it all could relate back to that game where you just had a gold on your team.

learn when to challenge your opponent when he has the ball, and try to win 50s, but a lot of that will come with time and repetition. you can start learning to put the ball on your car and flick the ball somewhere, preferably forward, but anywhere. again putting your opponent in an awkward position. and most importantly keep capitalizing on their mistakes and slowly learn to ground dribble faster, and again that will come with time and practice.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

you must win your first two games of the tournament to have positive mmr gain. if you lose the first or second game you will have negative mmr. 

winning a tournament is not enough gain to jump you from say, gold 1 div 1 to plat 1 div 1. if you start a tournament at gold 1 div 1 and you win the whole thing, i think you'd jump to gold 2 div 3 or 4. i could be wrong on that but it's somewhere in there.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

what got me into diamond was i started playing casual matches with a buddy in champ, and i had to learn to adjust to a quicker style of play and positioning against tough talent helped a ton. try to find someone to play with who is ranked high who will be brutally honest with you when you make any mistake, and you�ll eventually become very aware of your issues and combat them.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

4137,"some general tips:

\- don't just throw away the ball. if you have space, use it. 

\- probably one of the most difficult things: watch your own replays and see where you messed up. also look at it from your teammates perspective. sometimes you think that your teammate messed up but when you watch from their perspective you can see that maybe it was you that put them in the position.

\- try not to put the blame on your teammates but look at what you could have done better ( in this case do as i say, not as i do)

\- be easy to read for your teammates. either go for the ball or don't. faking out your teammates with indecisiveness leads to double commits.

\- work on the basics. fancy mechanics for 1% of the match will not help you rank up. solid foundations will.

\- be the teammate you wish you had.

\- read your teammate(s). if your teammate(s) is/are very aggressive then play a bit more defensively and the other way around.

\- take a break when you're tilted. nothing good ever happens when you're angry.

\- freeplay (this has already been mentioned but its so important so i'm going to repeat it)

\- don't try to change/improve everything at once. that is too much. for a match maybe try to focus on 1-2 things in your gameplay and try to focus on that.

\- maybe go through replays with someone that is higher ranked to point out what you can work on.",-0.1602,0.093,0.823,0.084

4191,"when it comes to mechanics in 1s, i'd say work on your flicks/dribbling. also half flip is a great mechanic to learn for recoveries.

the main thing i would say to work on is playing patiently and using good shadow defence. wait for your opponent to make a move, a lot of the time they will throw possession away and practically give you the ball and possibly an open net.

fake challenge often. make sure to use that drift button too, it's very useful when faking a challenge if you give it a few light taps when you're turning away to get into position faster to try to save a flick or gain possession.

last thing i'll say. don't worry about your rank. the only way to get better, is to keep playing. you will probably lose over and over sometimes, just keep at it. even if you drop all the way to bronze, you'll get back up to where you were and probably higher if you keep at it. just make sure you're having fun",0.9707,0.055,0.755,0.189

4383,"i was one of this people sometimes, but i mostly managed to get rid of my toxicity.



1. i fear, i have to tell you its the same with high rank players in most competitiv games.

champs in rocket league, diamonds in lol, supreme/global ranks in cs...

these people are good at their game. but they arent on the top level (semi pros or pros, these ones often now the only way to improve is focusing on themselves)

so we are good but not great, but we think we are way better than we actually are. and if you fail to carry a game where you think you are the best player on the server you get mad.

and because we think we are really good, it must be everyone elses fault.


this is one of the greatest reasons for toxicity in high ranks.
everyone thinks he is the one and knows the best way to play, but isnt good enough to see, that the only way to improve is focusing on your own mistakes. 

2. you often have a great skill discrepancy between players in the same high rank. 

iam champ 1 in rl, but my mechanics are pretty bad. i know how to challange and how to pressure and thats why iam there. 
the other guy maybe hits consistend flip resets but doesnt rotate well. thats why he is only champ 1 or 2.
and most games i think he is bad, because why cant he rotate it isnt so hard and he thinks iam bad, because i cant dribble well ..... 

and there you have a toxic enviroment.

- queue as a duo and you ll be the 3rd, then will play like they are in 2s, not rotating/cutting with the 3rd, then use it as the one to blame if you are not enough aggressive to come as a 3rd, get scored after constantly getting 1v2 or 3, or if it is your to save the ball but they double commit but say you did
- queue as solo and will try so hard to do everything on the field and exactly not trying to mesh with the other duo or randoms.

the problem applies if their premades are on the other side too. if  their group highest player is 1200 and their lowest 900 their group mmr is around lets say 1000, (i'm being very vague here). you will be matched against their highest, since that's how matchmaking works. but in order to accomodate to their group mmr, the game will have to find lower ranked players just to level so it's a ""fair game"" on paper. but we all know it absolutely doesnt work that way.

in lower ranks you can 2,5v3 a team, it's doable. but the higher you go, the more punishible it is to lack another 3rd. i've been matched with countless premades like that, and most of the time either you play overly defensive and don't score at all or try to be everywhere at once and end up burnt out.",-0.8545,0.082,0.868,0.049

assists are atleast some what accurate, but it only counts the player last passing. so for 3 man passing plays the third player recieves nothing.

not to mention, this is not dropshot, so hitting the ball vertically to the air beside your net is an awful play. just get the hell out from below the ball and reposition for a decent touch. trust that your teammate will either 50-50 or save if the opponents get a shot on target.

people don't leave games that are even so those lobbies are full. if you stay in the lobby after losing that 20-0 game, you are guaranteed to get a completely fresh game, but it might take some minutes.     

 if they disable backfilling into lopsided games and  implement it so leaving a game and re-queuing puts you into an even/new game, it'll just encourage people to leave even more games even sooner until the average casual game lasts about 60 seconds.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

thanks for the positive reply!",0.9097,0.0,0.818,0.182
5000,"going into more depth about the ui aspect to this, as i love talking about ui and ux, it would make the feature more intuitive if there is *some* form of indication when respawning on screen of where you're respawning. that would probably look like a respawn timer (since that is long overdue as well, i think), and underneath it, a small spawn picker that *doesn't take focus from the game*, but just shows the status of what spawn you'll spawn at. 

essentially the spawn indicator could look similar to the controller overlays that streamers have, but with just the joystick, and a ""left spawn"" ""random spawn"" ""right spawn"" subtitle when the spawn is highlighted. hold left, the indicator points left. hold right, indicator points right. hold nothing, and the stick doesn't change, and it gives the ""random spawn"" subtitle.

this would be an intuitive ui element, as

1. typically after being demo'd, your stick is pointed in some direction, so players would see after being demo'd the element having the resseting to centre motion as they let go of their stick, and get curious on what the element is and experiment with what it does on their own, so there is no need for a tutorial.

2. for kb/m users, who don't use controllers, it still works, because the element should look *similar* to a stick, not actually be a joystick. there's enough seperation in the element from a stick for it to still feel intuitive to kb/m players, who experiment with the element for the same reasoning as above.

however a ui element is still quite optional. this still makes sense as ""just another feature that exists in the game,"" even without ui telling you about it. players will get by without it, like we've begrudgingly done this whole time.",0.8751,0.011,0.936,0.053

the casual backfill is annoying though i do agree. experienced players get salty because they miss a shot once and just leave the game lol it's a bit funny but also a bit sad (kinda sums up the feeling behind the rocket league communty's attitude in general, though lol)

also, if you're trying a new car, the closer the car model is to its hitbox, the better the car will feel at first, because your eyes will look at your model and evaluate if you can hit the ball or not, etc.

as you get more used to the car, you'll probably rely less on what your car looks like to evaluate hits.

overall, if you stick to a car, they're all the same.

even hitboxes, as far as the game has progressed, don't matter that much. yes, because the plank hitbox is shorter, some very close hits you'd land with your roof, let's say, with a merc hitbox, become misses. but once you get used to the hitbox, all you'll have to do is adjust a bit your positioning. the game hasn't come to a min-maxing state where every small percentage of difference matters.",0.5443,0.014,0.933,0.052

plus different appearences can make things more readable.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

5188,"> so my question is, why does rocket league need admin rights to be playable? its not supposed to need admin rights

well, me and many other users don't need to run the game as admin. so the game definitely doesn't need it. 

maybe something about your setup, drivers, files or a combination of the above cause an odd issue where this would be the case.",0.4144,0.034,0.892,0.074
5189,thank you! although i'm sorry but that doesn't answer the question. psyonix even encourages players to run rocket league as admin if the game crashes or freezes. there is a reason for it and i wish to know what that is. is it too much asked if i want to know what a game/program does on my computer that has admin rights?,0.8622,0.035,0.798,0.167
5190,"you could try the epic version of rl instead of the steam version.

otherwise you probably have extra processes running under your normal user account, that's all.

1. look in the taskbar (bottom-right). you need the default windows things running, like network+speakers+clock+notifications+defender, but most other stuff is probably unnecessary. try right-clicking on any other ones and doing ""exit"" then see if rl is cured. if it has helped, reboot and either a) uninstall that app completely or b) right-click them again to find their option to stop them loading on start-up.
2. look in task manager (ctrl+shift+esc). under the ""start-up"" tab, disable anything you don't need, reboot, and see if rl is cured. you can easily re-enable those if you need to.
3. look in task manager (ctrl+shift+esc). under the ""details"" tab, click on the cpu column to sort by cpu usage and see if anything is constantly or heavily using your cpu. uninstall any application that you don't think should be doing much.

there's no need to run any commercial software under admin. don't believe anyone who suggests it as a solution - it's a terrible idea because of the potential security risks.",-0.3612,0.06,0.887,0.053

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

it's not though, so it's 100% on your random matched teammates to *read the fucking play*. unfortunately switching ball cam off and going for back corner boost is the norm with randoms, unless they decide to flail at a ball in the corner with 3% boost while you hit the brakes on your good angle play behind them.

>a blind pass to center is not a �good pass�, it�s a good way to get counter attacked.

you're right but if you're with randoms then there's probably no real time verbal communication on your team which means that it's that much more important that everybody *reads the fucking play* and does their job. i can't imagine an online multiplayer game where game sense isn't important.",0.967,0.071,0.765,0.164

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

i wish i would have saved the comment from the dev during one of the patch notes threads but this is implemented. but since there are far more solo queuers than parties (assumption) there will still be an imbalance that needs to be filled.

> i'm okay sacrifising a few sec longer queue's to get in a game that actually has equal winning chances

queuing at the higher ranks already takes minutes, splitting the pool would be devestating.

> in a rank that i basically peak on with randoms, then you could assume playing with a premade is too strong.

or you have a harder time adjusting to the random teammate and that is a weakness in your game.

i can tell you from my experience when duo or solo queue the games against a partied team are easier than two solo queuers. the party is more predictable, often over confident, and easier to read. while the solo queuers are less predictable, and most times less aggressive (the double ball chasers is the easiest games).",0.9903,0.026,0.758,0.215

the post is about the advantages duo queu players have. yeah you can adjust to your teammate, but that's the only thing you can do. the post is about already having a disadvantage before the game starts. adjusting to my teammate is just a small thing i can do about it. e.g. you can't adjust your gameplay to a toxic teammate that scores own goals on purpose, stops playing, has high ping, afks, just naming random things. there's a lot of things that are out of your control when playing solo. which makes it unfair when the enemy team has all control over those things. that's the point here.",-0.8276,0.1,0.828,0.073

now, the difference in hitboxes determines what kind of playstyle suits you. flat cars like dominus are used mostly by skilled offensive players, you can see that in the pro scene as well, cuz flat long cars are better for air stuff, and being unpredictable with the ball.

this happens when your client is out of sync with the server. typically, a desync happens when you leave a game before the post-game scoreboard. everything is correct on the server side. your game client will not update the amount of points you lost [or won] until you restart the game or complete another game in the same playlist and stay until the post-game menu.

if you lost your previous game(s), the demotion will show the next time you reach the post-game scoreboard.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

so id say you give yourself something to work on. this obviously depends on you, and then practice that, idk 1 hour a day maybe, and then play the rest of the time so it matches the schedule youd like to follow.

2 hours a day with a focused schedule is equally good as 10 hours a day with a slobby schedule.

jump - x,   
boost - r1,   
air roll/powerslide - l1,   
toggle ball cam - square,   
air roll left/right - circle/triangle,   
accelerate/brake - square, 

i don't believe most people move ball cam, however i think it's one of the most important buttons. i have mine on square because my thumb is always on square, meaning i can transition at any time. ball cam is great for quickly scanning what's in front of you, or dribbling, or going for bumps/demos. i personally believe that my ball cam being on square and having a quick transition speed allows me a massive advantage, because i'm able to use either camera mode instantly.

you should experiment with ball cam and see what works for you, because you won't be able to exactly mirror my playstyle with just this post, and you might also find other things that i haven't thought of. best of luck!",0.9064,0.031,0.866,0.103

as for you being stuck in diamond, i'm wondering if you are on pc or console. i barley would scratch at c1 on ps4 and now i'm c2 in every mode and gc in tourney since i got on pc. frame rate really was a problem for me. but truth is diamond is just cancer. i win half my games in c2 but i'd lose more than half in diamond. partly because you never know who is on the field, are they good or bad, how they position and their game sense, their consistency.. but also because diamonds are almost unfakable. most have decent game sense, decent mechanics, and really an all around decent understanding of the game, but they just boost boost boost boost boost. my trick to getting out of diamond was i played without using boost until the opening was there and tried to make my tmm8 get mvp. of course i didn't skip an open net but in diamond it felt like i was fighting my tmm8 for the ball and it felt like the opponent was ready for me to shoot. made me wonder what if i kill 2 problems with 1 pass play. of course my teammate wasn't always ready but after your oppents see you're passing it then just shoot instead.",0.9922,0.111,0.666,0.223

reset by rotating back post. 

 grab some pennies and rotate all the way back to back post. just chill there for a second the ball will come to you. also the other team is going to pass it right to you. via bouncing it off the corner to get it towards the goal. so wait for the pass. also if you bounce it back into the corner you are essentially passing it to the other team. 

don't just hit the ball and watch the ball. watch the other team. look at them. think of the directions they are going in and how they are going to hit the ball and where the ball is going after (especially when the pace is fast it gets easier to read them then). you can read how the ball is going to bounce off of a wall. now read how the ball is going to bounce off of the opposite team.

if you're referring to the rocket pass, then you do get distinct items up until you get every single possible item and start pulling from a pool of items you've already achieved.

if you're referring to items you get just for playing, then things have changed a lot, although not in the way you seem to be hinting at.

in the early days, before this new leveling system, we used to get drops randomly after each game. we were put on a timer and we could only get drops for, i believe, 14 hours each week, and that counter would reset on thursdays.

with the new leveling system, we get a guaranteed drop each time we level. we get drops at predictable times now and there's no limit to how many you can get.

the problem is, neither of the two systems i just described every guaranteed unique items. they always grabbed from the free item pool and risked granting you duplicates. duplicates were to be expected.

now, what i think you may be referring to is an entirely separate system. the above systems are strictly referring to items of uncommon rarity or higher. but before f2p, new players would unlock a brand new item after every single match from the common item pool. they would unlock a new, unique item every single game until they received every single common item in the game. once every item was achieved, players no longer earned items after every game. but once f2p started, instead of giving an item after each game, they decided to start handing them out in bulk based on level. but that's not important to your case.",-0.2115,0.039,0.932,0.029

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

""earned"" credits like those you get from the premium rocket pass are shared between all linked accounts. spending on one platform will deduct the amount spent on other platforms because they are shared not duplicated.",0.9709,0.0,0.797,0.203

once you can accept the rank you are and decide on your own terms if you want to improve or not, things get a lot better. you can start playing for fun instead of status. it can still be fun to compete and try to get higher ranks, but realizing it's just a game and that losing doesn't actually do anything can really change your perspective.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

why the rewards are all color/logo specific so you know what's first place or whatever, but it doesn't mean you're first place in the world, aka like a school spelling bee, 

rewards have always been like this, so just get good enough for rlcs, trade, or spend money on the game, cuz everything else is rng based and very low odd rng so a bronze has same odds as a ssl in getting a tw octane, or tw zomba blueprint cuz blueprint drops are time based not win/loss based",0.9879,0.031,0.761,0.208

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

7710,hmm. do you play 1s? i think 1s really helps in realizing where you're lacking. it's all about making less mistakes than the opponent. if you make a mistake you get punished and that really helps with improving. i'd say for mechanics you could try to play a few shooting packs. playing a shooting pack for 15 minutes a day for 4 days single handedly got me out of low plat. i'd also recommend getting consistent with the basic frontflip flick. up until diamond people dont really know how to counter it and it's pretty easy to learn. speedflipping is also really useful. you can win most kickoffs with it and using it to move around the field makes you generally just faster,0.971,0.067,0.701,0.232
7711,"i bet it's speed. you seem to be the type who thinks a lot what he's doing, which costs you time when sometimes you need to just beeline to the ball as fast as possible. learning to not hesitate is difficult but very important. focus on doing everything you currently do, but faster and faster. what i find helpful in freeplay, is just hit the ball as hard as possible, and then catch up to it as fast as possible. hit it up the wall and go for awkward shit all the time. makes you try something new from difficult positions instead of the usual stuff you normally practice. for a long time my freeplay was not effective because i just did the same things over and over again.",-0.1937,0.085,0.829,0.086

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

all the same, it is more relaxed than ranked and tournaments. people are just too quick to judge what they think is the standard of their teammate in ranked and tournaments. you're better off with them leaving than behaving how they would in ranked.

the other thing is, casual ratings seem to keep on going up. i played one session where i only won 1 in 3 games, but gained 40 rating. so if you play casual a lot, you can end up at the same rating as better players who haven't played as many casual games.",0.9839,0.015,0.756,0.229

mine is 1959 or something like that. i was always in 'my rank' with casual lobbies but one day i decided ""no, i'm not leaving matches early any more"" . you must lose less mmr for sticking around, than quitting i dunno.

but now i see in 1900-2100, gcs and ssls. it's hard, i can't just hop into casual to relax lol. i have to play ranked for easier games. but, it's helping me get faster. i'm only champ 1-2 normally.

the real downside is ltms use casual mmr to matchmake too, so heatseeker is always harrowing for me lol.

ultimately though, it's a mixed bag at any casual 'mmr'. i still get diamond ish players matched with us. it's not ideal but try nto to worry about losing the game, or winning the game. focus on winning challenges, small interactions. playing against better people will get you better, as long as you understand enough. like, you won't be able to start air dribbling or flip reseting by watching it enough. you still have to practice. but yeah, speed and general play you will learn by being seeped in it.",0.9932,0.077,0.644,0.279

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

we score the first one, everyones silent (my team mate was a psynet so didnt see the gg). they score on us and let loose the what a saves and ""just ff"" etc. and im like dope we got a game on our hands - one was super mechanical but couldnt land anything really, the other kept missing a lot so i targeted that dude for when to challenge etc. after that we scored about 3 more and every time i just hit ""close one"" or ""nooooo"" then they scored and again, what a save'd a bunch but not as much as last time. then idk something happened and we turned it up and just scored 4 more immediately all the while im still just hitting close one or great pass if i scored off one of their touches and its like 8-2 with a minute and a half left and i just hit ""gg"", we scored again and they left. think one of them was boosting the other so was cocky about it but didnt expect to run into a higher smurf. was quite a good laugh though i hope i taught them to not be toxic but lets be real they probably doing it to the next guys in the next game.

i agree with this though, but to put it nicer for bigbear; try not to let people get to you dude, just have fun in the game you enjoy and if people are being toxic, its only cause they dont want to blame themselves for their mistakes - people are toxic cause of the high pressure/ranked/competitive nature of the game.

try just laugh at the toxic people, just kindly let them know they're in the same rank as you for a reason (this will set them off, but you can literally just say it and ignore everything else they say because its true and they dont want to admit to fault).

its just a game at the end of the day and you're there to play and have fun, dont let a few angry people get to you and stop you from playing and having fun. its about learning and improving yourself to get better. we all encouter it, just take the piss out of them/dont feed them or just reply ""lol"" this gets to them more than anything because they want a reaction to justify their rant.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

learn backboard defense

learn shadow defense

point being: it doesn't make much sense to turn chat off without turning it off. and auto-banning based on words typed with all-chat off doesn't make *any* sense either. i curse like a sailor in my personal life, yet that's no reason to ban me ingame. neither is typing curse words in a word document. and neither should smashing the keyboard without anyone being able to see it ingame.

>can i download rl on pc and log in with my epic account and then trade like that? i keep my inventory right?

as long as your accounts are linked yes. except credits and pre ftp licensed dlc which will remain on the platform they were purchased.

>i know you cannot trade when you have bought items but what does this mean? i have never spent any real money on the game but what about buying chest from in game currency etc?

cross-platform tradeable items:

non-crate, uncrafted blueprints, golden gifts/eggs/etc..., rlcs twitch drop, and rocket pass season 1 and after are tradeable on linked platforms that you can log onto.

platform trade locked items:

items that were opened with keys or built with credits are only tradeable on the platform they were opened or built. this includes rocket pass 6 or before.

credits you have on psn will not transfer to your pc account either.

>i have like 5 fennec blueprint and other stuff and is more expensive on pc?..

you can check rocket league insider to get a ballpark idea of what an item is worth. for blueprints rule of thumb is base price minus crafting cost.

credits that you get on pc most likely won't be available on your psn.

purchased credits do not cross platforms. if a credit got it's birth into the game by being purchased it will not show up on any other platform than the one it was purchased. so spending this credit on one platform will not affect the amount of credits you have on another platform.
 
""earned"" credits like those you get from the premium rocket pass are shared between all linked accounts. spending on one platform will deduct the amount spent on other platforms because they are shared not duplicated.
 
credits do not lose their status when traded. they also stack so when trading or spending credits you will not know what type you are getting or using if you have a mix of the two types",0.9942,0.011,0.835,0.153

ones will make you better against 1 opponent. it will improve your personal ball handling skills, and car control. but again that is against 1 opponent. add in more opponents and the game changes. the little tricks or clears to get it past a defender can end up serving it up to their teammate.

i am the exact opposite of you. my team play is my strongest part of my game and solo plays the weakest. i find i can rank up in 3' easily, 2's i'm ok and 1's i hate because i prefer passing plays. i know i need to play more ones, but because it is the weakest part of my game it isn't fun.

i can tell you especially in 2's i've run into the 1's mains that think their teammates are holding them back. for example i catch the ball in our corner. i get the corner boost. the opponents have retreated to their half and i have a clear path to start any type of play i want. i start coming out of the corner and boom. teammate that has been playing super aggressive all game comes in hits the ball away from me into the wall deep down field to the waiting opponents. then whiffs his challenge and blames the goal on me when i can't defend the 2v1 passing play. then calls me a trash teammate and challenges me to a 1v1.

when i get the super aggressive i don't trust my teammate types i try to stick to challenging early, or getting 50/50's that get the ball to the teammate in open field because i know they are going to cut me off or slam the ball the opponent was just about to hit to me, or zoom in and take the ball if i make a single touch to set up a solo play.

for just these words you've typed i can't say what kind of player you are, but it might be worth watching replays from your teammates' and opponents' perspective to notice any mistakes or over commits that you may be making. alternatively you can have people review your replays and see what they gleam from your gameplay.",0.9676,0.101,0.737,0.162

having said that the first time i played you i was so mad. we are platinum players, we aren't doing flip reset double taps, in fact we are still learning to control the ball properly. what a demo does is completely take you out the play. once you are demoed you have no agency any more. it's like having a 5 minute 1v1 basketball game in real life and the guy spends 4 minutes and 50 seconds with his back to you dribbling at arms length never making a play on net before doing a layup and winning.  it kind of kills the usual flow of the game.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

_________

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

it's not like anyone is claiming that this game is an accurate representation of real life physics. 

it gets somewhat close (relative opinion), but it's truly its own game, so if a double touch like this gives it extra power, so be it, that's just how it works. 

it's also been the best aspect of rocket league. so many mechanics that have been discovered by plaers throughout the years, kuxir pinch, musty, flip reset, etc. 

none of them were exactly intended to be implemented, but the physics engine just kind of let the exist, and that's great. 

the important part, and the part that i think rocket league has done so well as a game, is that all of these things are repeatable, and reliable, which i think sets them apart from being a mechanic, compared to a glitch.

it's mechanic of rocketleague and probably good tactic for heatseeker, but you can dodge the bump   :) and don't forget, player this is resource if you wasting resources for bumping, your goalkeeper stay alone and this is probably complicates the gameplay for your mate.  
btw u can start bump together :)

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

it all just depends on taste and if you like a certain item or not. because if an item is trash and you know you'll never use it, then i can understand why getting painted versions of it might suck for you.

but seriously wtf is your point? you want more variety in the rocket pass? they literally give you 60 new items 3 or so times a year, basically for free because you get credits back in the pass, with 10 or so of them coming with painted versions, including a sick car, goal explosion, boost, wheels..

1. keep boost on one of the face buttons (circle or square in this case) and fat finger jump and boost. boost on circle is default which is why it's so common. having boost on square makes it easier to fat finger since your thumb better aligns with square and x rather than circle and x. and some people flip this where they have boost on x, and jump on square.
2. put boost on a separate button (usually r1) so that you use boost and jump with two different finger. this is what i do since i felt uncomfortable doing the fat finger strategy. if you do this one, you would have to have arl/arr on square/circle which is what i do.

9781,"tvs generally have more input lag then say monitors, coming from 2500 hours on sub 3ms monitors  (least that what they advertised at) at 165hz, i can confirm that whenever i've tried to play on tvs or even 60fps pc monitors my gameplay severely suffers as a result. however, from your post you probably could've guessed this. 

tv size doesn't necessarily dictate input delay, that comes down to the manufacturer and engineering behind the display. tvs can commonly have input lags in the 40-60ms range but it can vary widely. tvs can be weird also, in the manner that they sometimes have filters and settings that are meant for motion pictures, so some tvs have built in motion blur effects or other techniques that pleasure motion picture viewing but can really tank response time on the panel. 

so best thing i can advise is to look through your displays settings to see if perhaps it has a gaming mode or the option to turn some filter settings off, i've seen a few tvs that have this feature and it seemed to help a bit. but in general if you are noticing input lag and it's really bothering you, unfortunately the typical real solution is to find new displays that list lower response times.",0.2041,0.105,0.807,0.087

it simply boils down to preferences. i use octane because i'm used to it and i like how it looks. some people use dominus or breakout for the exact same reasons.

two things that might play into it is that many of the pros use octane or fennecs (which use an octane hit box), and people new to the game use them, the pros, as an example. fennecs are not a default car, and the octane is... in fact, it's the default car. those two things combined likely lead lots of people to play with octanes.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

10007,"yo, i was high gold, low plat at the end of last season and just finished a comp game that pushed me into diamond.

what would recommend (as a player that still has a lot to improve on):

**focus on hitting the ball.** if you can make consistent contact and get the ball where you want it, you're on a great track.

**manage your boost and steal your opponent's boost.** it's so hard to be caught out with nothing in the tank all the way across the field. steal your opponents boost when it won't put you out of position, but if you're driving ahead of them, take all of the boost they would be able to get on the way.

**play defensively.** i don't mean sit in net and wait for the ball, but like 60-75% of my goals are counterattacks. wait for them to whiff, hit a strong shot off of the backboard and take it into their own net. being aggressive when you can't really do *too* much offensively aside from power shots is a recipe for disaster.

**aerial selectively.** only go up if you know you can hit it and hit it somewhere beneficial, or as a last resort. but if you're trying to get better at aerialing, lower level 1s ain't it. you'll just end up flying across the field 99% of the time and it's a free goal for the opponent.

**free play!** just drive around, flip, spin, practice air rolling to land smoothly on the ground, practice being fast. there's no pressure, you can just vibe out! i spend like 10 or 15 minutes in free play before i play ever, and then i usually hop into casual, but i just don't like ranked much or playing with randoms. 

**training packs.** i love the saves training pack by poquito, it's always in the browser if you want to use it! anything about powershots, i know the rocket league school subreddit has a lot of posts with training pack recommendations. same with rocket-league.com - i would recommend just doing a bunch of them, but also find some that are challenging but completable. i don't see that aerial training packs are really great at low level 1s because we're not hitting anything crazy. not to say don't work on them, but focus less if you care about 1s right now. and at gold-low plat, a player with great shooting and ground control will best a player with mediocre ground and aerial control. start from the bottom and build your way up, don't spread yourself too thin.

let me know if there's anything else you're curious about!",0.9967,0.061,0.745,0.193

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

i've seen your story and it's your fault but in the past i have thought about how they could improve the system.

maybe like a cooldown where there is a thick red line creating a border around the other person's items.  then if they don't change their items for 10 seconds that border turns green.  i'm sure most of these scammers use tricks like typing in the chat - which is at the bottom right away from the items - to swap out items.  this border would take away that advantage and let people know that they need to re-check the items whenever it turns red.

just something that makes changes clear.  even just a noise when people added or remove items would alert people to a swap out.

i know a lot of people just want to say, ""people should pay more attention"" but one of the bigger problems here is that there's no recourse regardless of success and they can sell the items they got from scanning for real money.

11055,"2 ways:

**direct half-flip**

do a backflip and ensure that it is directly backwards. tilt your car forward when your car is parallel to the ground, and then air roll to land. the gotcha here is that the timing is dependent on what type or air roll you use. if you have a directional air roll, you can apply that immediately. if you have free air roll, you need to wait for the flip animation to complete, so you have to wait a little longer before you can start air rolling.

**diagonal half-flip**

if you do a backwards flip that isn't directly backwards, such as a diagonal backflip, if you cancel the flip directly forward by tilting your car forward, your car will automatically level out with the ground and air roll is unnecessary.

&#x200b;

it sounds like you're not actually back-flipping, but manually doing a backflip by holding backwards. that's not how you half-flip. half-flips imply flip cancellation. do a backflip (jump, jump again while holding back) and when your car is half-way done with the flip, push your analog stick forward (opposite direction of the flip) and hold it so that your car stops flipping.",0.3182,0.018,0.953,0.03

2. roll - (i have my bumpers mapped to roll left and roll right) after you perform the flip cancel you then need to roll your car so that the wheels land on the ground. for me, i backflip cancel, and then use my left bumper to rotate and land on the ground. then you just gas and go.

if you are talking about it being slow to get to a ball behind you, you can try to apply boost once you are horizontal to the ground, as this will help push your momentum in the direction you are facing. hope this helps.",0.967,0.049,0.809,0.142

there's also a small effect which slows you down if you brake in the air (holding accelerate while in the air will move you forwards slightly) so you would be marginally slowing your forward movement while pulling back on the stick. don't think this would be significant. but again, not ideal.

11095,"og seasons didn't do soft resets at the end of each season, and so the inflation accumulated each season was allowed to grow and grow while naturally shifting the distribution up towards the higher ranks over time. people often misinterpret more people getting to higher ranks, such as gc, as an expected result of player skill improving. but that's not how things work. the entire population could have gotten worse at the game and more people would have still ended up at the top.

with regards to gc, seasons 4, 5, 6 & 7 all had consistent gc %. during these seasons, inflation was having an impact, but not so much on gc because the distance from the reset cap was low enough for it to not matter. they changed the threshold that top players were set back to going into season 8 and it had a direct impact on inflation reaching the gc level. the gc % increase every season after 7 - with the exception of season 10, which reduced slightly due to a short season - and many seasons even saw the % double. season 13 had a massive amount of inflation accumulated and season 14 completely doubled that.

with f2p, psyonix finally decided to implement a soft reset at the end of season, which serves to manage inflation and keep the distribution more consistent (assuming they don't keep extending season lengths). what that means is that if you promote from, let's say, platinum 3 one season to diamond 1 by the end of the next season, it means that you've actually improved relative to your peers rather than the system potentially giving you that extra little push without your relative rating increasing at all. for gcs, this meant a reduction in the distribution % back to somewhere around season 11 values, which is kind of a compromise between seasons 4-7 and season 14.

so, what you're seeing is just a change in distribution rather than players ending up somewhere they don't belong (although many players feel like they're stuck lower because of it since their symbol changed).

anyway, in my experience, if you see a gc title from seasons 13, or 14, they probably couldn't reach it in season 1. the same can be assumed to a lesser extent for season 12, and perhaps 11.

for fun, this is how i would rate the gc titles in order of prestige:

11116,"so, first of all, you have to realize that your car is reacting to the force of the ball. if your car is getting thrown in any horizontal direction, it means that you're not hitting the ball directly center. if you're getting pushed backwards, it means you're hitting it center, but the angle of your car doesn't perfectly counter the force of the ball.

there's a few things you can do:

1. air rolling as you make contact applies force to your car that lessens the impact of the hit.
2. boosting as you make contact, can help apply forward force towards the ball that could help your ability to stay with it.
3. rolling your nose forward as you contact the ball can help lessen the impact by apply force in the direction opposite that the ball wants to push you.

maybe you've played soccer and you'll understand the comparisons:

* if a ball is coming at you for a header and you let it hit your head, your head is going to get jerked in the opposite direction of the ball and the speed of the ball coming off of your head is going to be dampened. it's also going to hurt your head.
* if a ball is coming at you for a header and you apply some sort of force into the ball to (a) keep your head stable during collision (flex, turn) or (b) apply force back into it, then the ball will come off with force, your head won't react, and the header itself won't hurt you.

i would recommend practicing making contact with the ball without using air roll, though, before you start to implement it. why? because, like many other skills, certain mechanics can be used as tools or as crutches. what does that mean? well, if you're using air roll to fix the problem of not making contact in the appropriate spot, then you're not going to be able to master the skill. if you first learn how to make consistent contact without air roll, which you can tell by your car's reaction, then you'll know how to contact the ball and air rolling will become a tool instead of a crutch.",0.8752,0.057,0.857,0.087

for example, if your friend is plat 2 div 1 and you're silver 2 div 1, you'll match against opponents with an average rank of plat 1 div 3.

the system also prioritizes matching parties against other parties and solo teams against other solo teams. in my experience, i've also seen enough to feel confident claiming that the system will do its best to try and match you against other teams with rank discrepancies when one, such as yours, exists, assuming other such teams exist in the queue at the same time.",0.9869,0.009,0.792,0.199

there are a few different layouts you can use but i find it is helpful if you rebind air roll and power slide. i put them both on l1 so that if i'm on the ground i can slide and if i'm in the air i can roll using the same button. i also put my boost on r1 because it feels more natural there to me. it's not as important when you're starting out but eventually, you'll probably want to bind air roll left or right to a button as well, i chose square. other than that i think the default controls are pretty good.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

 if it has been 3:30 of constant pressure and your team has barely cleared it to mid then it is best to forfeit. which you end up getting the people who will never forfeit and you are stuck in another 1:30 (more with each additional goal) of hell because 1 person believes forfeiting loses more mmr or believes that 1 time they came back from a 6 point deficit to go into overtime and win happens every game.",-0.7498,0.148,0.746,0.105

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

11812," i love the tournament system. i enjoy the items, and the daily challenge and progression of a tourny. but unfortunately as of late i've either had comically bad luck or something is maybe a little out of wack in the match making.

just yesterday i queued for a tournament 3pm pdt. the first match one of our teammates didn't move the whole match, and he didn't leave or forfeit. we tried to 2v3 it for awhile, but alas came up short. no big deal, i'll just que for the 2nd chance. same thing happens again, teammate is afk but eventually forfeits. f. looks like i won't be getting many rewards. so i decide to give it another go at 6pm pdt, this time i have 0 teammates. just stuck right in a 1v3. i didn't even bother and left (which now will probably ban me for a time). i could just stop playing tournaments, but the thing is i enjoy the reward items and since they're untradeable playing tourneys is the only way to get them. however, when i get ranked down because of afk teammates or no teammates at all, that also affects how much tourney tokens i get.

another option would be to get the ds4 back button attachment. keep arl on l3, put power slide on l1 (you should move it from default so you can boost and slide at the same time when needed), and then arr on square. then set the back button attachment to replicate l3 and square on the back buttons. then you can use arl and arr from the back buttons anytime you like.",0.986,0.008,0.808,0.184

i think it's generally thought that everyone finds something that works for them. but the potential is of course there for some to get stuck with some bad habits that get in the way of efficiently interacting with the controller. nothing else to do except force yourself to do it all differently, whatever it is you need to change. be disciplined and stick with it until it becomes natural to you. it will take time, but you have to stick with it. i remember the middle fingers on triggers was super awkward in the beginning, because i felt like my whole grip on the controller wasn't as good. now i have no problems with the grip, and if i switch back that's super awkward. so it really is just a matter of habit and getting used to it. the brain is nothing if not flexible.

as you get better/more experienced, you will notice some ways in which how you interact with the controller might not be optimal (controller config, grip, what fingers for what buttons/functions). that's quite normal, and might also lead to you wanting to make some changes. i highly recommend going with that feeling and making the changes you want, if you believe it will be a change for the better. you'll thank yourself later.",0.9446,0.075,0.805,0.12

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

i reported many people over a 6 week period and followed up with them. those that were willing to gave me proof they never got any sort of ban for their unsportsmanlike4 conduct or smurfing. i even sent reports to psyonix nearly every day for those 6 weeks as well, but to no avail. they just closed my tickets and wouldn't address it when i showed them proof.

meanwhile in casual i have a mmr of 1711 and routinely play against diamonds to gc's and am able to play well enough that i can keep up and even get mvp's at this skill level.

not really. there should be somebody who can get to the goalie position faster than the enemy team can get halfway between corner and mid boost. usually that means when you rotate on offense you should hit the ball and then rotate back to about midcourt.

if it's a fast paced game you can make the rotations a bit wider, if it's a really technical play in the enemies corner you can have one person in the corner one person in front of the net and another just past mid boost.

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

_________

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

a few tips, try to play practice games against bots for a bit, that should take the anxiety out of it and allow you to practice. do the practice drills, and learn how & when to use the different flips (forward/left/right/back). also out some time into controlling aerial manoeuvres. they're tricky at first but worth the effort.

13278,"congrats! people are surprised by your progress, but you posted this 7 hours ago and your tracker says your have 914 games this season alone. i repeat: this season alone. considering you hit champion at the very earliest yesterday, that means you�ve played, at the very least, 109 games in the last 1-2 days alone. considering how the average player spends their time, that�s going to be around 19 hours, but i�m willing to bet you�re a bit more condensed and just playing games either way, that�s a lot of time and people shouldn�t be surprised that you�re hitting champion that quickly. mass frequency is always the answer to these low hour-to-rank ratios. champion in 300 hours or so has never been especially abnormal for committed players, and with the time you said you spent on a previous account, i�d place you at 200 hours at the very least with 300 being a very real possibility. not to discourage your achievement, but just to put it in perspective for other people. and that�s just from what we know about you at the surface level.

i will say, though, that these posts about �i finally hit x rank after a relatively short amount of time� is, even if unintentional, quite condescending and discouraging to players, and comes off as bragging or egotistical. i�m not saying that�s your intention, but it�s how it�s perceived.",0.963,0.065,0.797,0.138

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

13466,"this is called cheating up. in 3v3 someone should cheat on every kickoff while the third gets boost. there is no reason not to. at high-level someone always cheats so if you don't, the other team gets the first possession.
for 2v2s, it's more personal preference. i'd say as your rank gets higher, it's better to cheat because you can play with less boost. either way, you need to be ready to save the ball. if you get boost, you should be turning back to goal by default (unless you have a good read or communicate with your teammate). if you cheat, don't get too close because you'll be out of position if the ball shoots at your net.
it also depends on spawns. if i spawn directly in the middle, i usually just hang out around net and react to the kickoff (go for corner boost vs challenge vs shadow. it's all situational. moral of the story, cheat if you're comfortable, but be ready. otherwise you should be fine getting boost. if your teammate gets destroyed on kickoff, that's his fault, but positioning yourself properly can make up for it.",0.5423,0.1,0.765,0.135

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

13766,"i don�t think they should change this. if you get mmr to improve ranks based on wins, you should have the same with losses. 

how would you feel if it was done the other way? you�re normally gold 3-plat 1 and go on a win streak to get you to play 2. should they demote you back to gold 3 because of a few losses? i think that�s pretty ridiculous. so why should that happen because of a few wins?

simple answer is you are the rank you deserve. there might be some outliers where you get teammates tanking/afk/other team smurfing. but for all the complaints i see about this, it�s not nearly as common as people suggest. 

if you�re truly at a skill above gold 1-2, you�ll get out of that rank fairly quickly. i�m plat 2-diamond in every mode. if you throw me in gold 3, i�m carrying and going to win 2/3 of the games. so i�d rank up easily. 

the problem people of low ranks have(gold players mostly) is there really isn�t a huge skill gap between gold 2- plat 1. yeah, if you�re normally around plat, you should be better and more consistent. but there�s more than enough wiggle room to say they�re pretty equal. 

at the end of the day, i lean more toward �you got yourself here. you get yourself out�.

edit: on top of that. playing at a plat level in gold 1 would easily win. you�ll get to every ball quicker. won�t give up easy goals. etc. golds won�t capitalize on basic mistakes, while even low level plats can. so you�d regularly be the best player in the game. which will lead to more wins.",0.9936,0.064,0.733,0.203
13767,so here�s the thing just in my example the first time i did placements nearly a year ago (i just started playing last year). i was gold 2. i was absolute shit back then but i still hung somewhat close with gold 2 players. since then i have improved massively. you know what rank i currently sit at right now? gold 1. i wouldn�t say it reflects skill properly. i have made it to plat 1 and probably spend most time in gold 3 and those are about fair. however i lose just as many games in gold 1 as i do in plat 1 even though there�s a huge difference in skill there. in gold 1 i might be carrying but i can�t carry enough to win a ton of games consistently. i also have to rely on the teammates in that division and their skill level. i almost do better when i have at least one teammate quit the game. then i usually make a comeback because i know i have to be back to save every ball. instead of seeing them go straight at it but whiff last second and then i can�t salvage the play.,0.975,0.03,0.817,0.153
13768,"its important to play to the rank you find yourself in, when you find yourself in lower ranks stop leaving balls for your teammates as they wont take it and try to make every touch a shot on net. when im in high plat ill often leave balls im under knowing my teammate probably has a better touch or touch the ball off the opponents backboard trusting that my teammate will be mid etc etc. when i lose rank due to an off day i stop playing for the day and the next day i play extra defensively to cover and just generally stop trusting my teammates until im back to where i was or can tell theyre decent.",0.1531,0.13,0.744,0.127
13769,the thing is you can�t always not trust teammates as that also makes you play worse overall. should i position myself in a place any good teammate could get the ball to me so i can shoot? or do i have to go way out of position and double commit because there�s a 50 percent chance he will whiff it? if all 3 of us are sitting in goal when they are making an attack should i make an attack at the ball to pressure them assuring my teammates have my back if he gets it by me? or do i sit there and let them shoot it over us because i don�t trust them to save it. really these lower ranks are making me play worse and get used to bad shit.,-0.957,0.224,0.664,0.112

13772,"i am a gc2 who solo q�d most of the way up to gc, i�m just going to leave some thoughts on this.

1. the skill floor has increased greatly in the last year especially with the addition of f2p. you very well could be getting better but do not forget everyone else is growing as well. i own every system and have a ton of accounts across all of them cause i�m a nerd for this game. i�ve played through the ranks many times and the visible improvement in the lower ranks like plat and diamond are noticeable(people used to not be able to fly in play way back when now they all can and some even hit ceilings.  my irl friends are p3/d1 they peaked at d3 couple points away from champ last year probably around the same time as you, more evidence the player base is getting better, but also they don�t train and have not gotten any better(barely if at all).

2. if you are in gold there is still a ton to learn and understand in the game, i don�t mean to be mean but that�s why i love this game. i have thousands of hours in and i still find ways to string things together or fine tune my movements at this level. do you train often? if you are on pc you can use bakkesmod to help simulate more game time situations which can make you more consistent. i would say pick one thing you want to improve on mechanically and just focus on that until you�re proficient(half flip, wave dash, stall, wall hits, dribbling, even just getting no boost solid touches and understanding how to get the hardest hit possible), then once you have an understanding of how to do it proficiently move on to the next mechanical focus. for example i practiced only double flip resets for 2 months until i got consistent at them, now i am focusing on breezi flicks heavily but will throw in a couple double flip resets to stay sharpe and continue to get better.

3. besides mechanical there is positioning and situational awareness. literally some people in champ still don�t have this so don�t get mad if it takes a while to master. situational awareness includes understanding when to use mechanical skills as well. at gold and plat players are not really consistent and if you are mechanically comfortable and understand the situation of who has boost and is where, how much time you have to get your touch(do u have to rush or can slow play a calculated hit) you can easily pick apart gold defenses if you have the car control to put the ball on net and just wait for them to mess up. also i tell this to every....they are trying to score on your net, the priority is alway keep the ball out of your net...that being said sometimes the best play is to go back and not rush up to 50 and take a shot if both tm8s are up or boost depleted. try to keep in mind where tm8s are all the time so you get a better fee for the ebbs and flows of the rotations. as you get more proficient in this area begin trying to look forward as to what is going to happen or actually make a play(if the ball is coming to the ground by your back left boost and you�re going to let it hit the ground and left diagonal flip clear it on the volley to their front left side, their defender is coming across the field right to left and his only path with the ball is back towards the wall on the left side, you know this so you go back up the wall and see if there is an opportunity to intercept/take a shot/get a 50) (little less advanced...someone dribbling ball from mid right trying to score an open net on you,  you�re following after a failed shot attempt, instead of try to go to the sides and get to him understand that he has to come to your net so you maintain a straight line to your net and dodge blocking his path to the net narrowly getting a close save.)

overall the goal is ample car control and situational awareness to match. once you have both of these you must consistently apply them, as yeah you may run into a smurf every now and then but over the long run you will average out to your general level. most people i know have 2-3 ranks they fluctuate between during the season, that�s normal, i wouldn�t fret. just make it a goal of yours to consistently stride to be more consistent and play faster. 

that being said i don�t think they should change the ranking system. it�s not perfect but it�s not bad either, truth be told, i like it. go to rl tracker and look at distribution so you know mmr thresholds for each rank and you can also see you�re own as well as progression over time. if you�re someone like me who solo q�d you understand you have to be better than you�re current rank. if you solo q d1 you gotta be able to play at like a d2/d3 level to really progress otherwise you will be you will probably run into a lot of win one, lose ones and then every 2-3 game lose streak can annoy you so much more. when you get mad put the controller down and come back to the game later and regroup, out of 10,000 games ive lost some heart breakers it is what it is at this point, and there will be more. 

wish you well in your rl journey.

13773,"i admit i don�t train often and i doubt i will ever be that good because firm movements in anything seem to be either beyond my hands or brain. not sure why. fighting games really showed me that too. any combos that required using the sticks diagonally while also pressing buttons felt nearly impossible for me. in rocket league translation this means i can�t dribble on top of my car for shit. i have tried for like a straight hour before with 0 progress. however aerials, fast driving and hits, and just positioning in general i�m much better than i originally was. 

you mention the player base has gotten better and that might be slightly true but i�m more so saying it doesn�t matter when i outplay my opponents in lower ranks as i then have to adapt to lower rank teammates and i do see the difference in their play. in their play i have to get wildly out of good positioning to back them up in case they miss which happens nearly 50 percent of the time. you might say the other team should be doing this too and that�s true most of the time but i also can�t predict that. should i be charging a ball they should be able to easily hit? no but if i did i might get lucky when they whiff. it�s just so inconsistent that i can�t even consistently win games. i have no easier time winning a game in silver 3 than i would on gold 3 and i have been in both of those divisions at some points in the last month.",0.9837,0.064,0.757,0.179

don't sell yourself short. just because you're older than most players doesn't mean you can't improve and get to high ranks. some people go up fast and than plateau. some people get better slow but consistently. and some people are in between. as long as you enjoy the game keep playing until you don't find it fun anymore that's what games are for.

also i'm sure your son is happy to play with you no matter your rank. if my dad played video games with me i would be so happy, no matter how good\bad he was. i'm sure his main concern at least in hindsight would be for both of you to have fun. so don't stress to bad and just try to enjoy. i'm sure that would make your son happiest in the long run.",0.9916,0.08,0.631,0.289

13902,"i have this idea which extends to social media, games, basically anything which includes some kind of ""report bad behavior"" feature.  

i believe that reports should all be proportional to how much someone reports, in their value.  perhaps also pro rated by percentage of games played.

easier to explain with a couple examples.

let's say that player a reports another player on just 1% of matches played.  

player b reports a lot, and in 50% of matches played they report at least one other player.

in this scenario, getting reported by player a goes against you 50x what a report from player b would go for.  

and also it goes against you proportional to how much you play.  if you are reported in 10% of games you play versus 1%, that is factored in.  

&#x200b;

then with this in mind there are actual consequences for players who are reported in high percentage of games, and garnering high percentage of report totals.  

i think that one issue with ""report this player/content"" is that with something like the whole ""likes/dislikes"" you have some people who can almost begin to troll/grief using the function itself.  the karen effect.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

14260,"i'll explain it once again (like 100 people befor me already)  
matchmaking puts you up against enemies who match the same mmr as your highest player.  
you can queue 3 people, one with 2000 mmr one with 400 and one with 200. if your enemies are all random, they all will be around 2000 mmr. if they queued up together, their top player will be around 2000 mmr.  


then your rank that gets displayed on the left as that icon is the average of your group.  
you can technically be in a gc tournament with a diamond icon if you manage to bring low level mates with you. depending on that you also get your rewards for the tourney, so even if you beat the gc tourney, you'd get diamond rewards.  


then, if both teams have the same mmr in average and one wins, it can totally be, that that win pushes you into the next rank. i started a c3 tourney and in the end won the s2 gc title because due to the winstreak we got placed into gc1 as average.  
so that means, if you lose and they win, they go +20 on the mmr, and the icon will be diamond you see after the game and not plat even though they were plat befor.  


your case is most likely the second case since you queued up with a 500 mmr guy that tanks your average far down. this is not unfair matchmaking as taking the highest player as a queue value is to prevent smurfing. so you can't grind to gc with a guy making bronze accounts only playing against plats and diamonds.  
technically the matchmaking here was even in your favor. your highest guy had 986 mmr while their highest was 951 prior to the win/lose.  


i hope this explains it.",0.9825,0.034,0.835,0.132

after i jump, i roll my car (whilst boosting so you dont lose speed) into the direction of where the ball is going to be, this controls which direction you want your car to fly in, whilst making the best attempt to reach it before anyone else.

that said, position your car at the best angle on the ground first, the less corrections you have to do in the air, the quicker you can move to the ball in aerial mode.

right before i make contact with the ball i also roll the car to make contact with the optimal side to generate the best power/direction (i.e. upside down if you're above it to hit it down, to the side if you're alongside of the ball etc).",0.9832,0.01,0.825,0.165

first of all, ball cam gives more a wider sense of where the play is going on, and helps you see if the ball is going towards net while you�re grabbing boost etc. 

if you�re going for an aerial, it is easier to see the ball from certain positions, and it doesn�t get your camera at weird angles where you cannot see your car nor the ball.

of course, pros still use car cam a lot, especially for: ground to air dribbling, normal dribbling, sometimes seeing boost positions in the field.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

well they finally listened... but they missed the part where we wanted specific s2 items. 

exalter's kind of unusual. on one hand, i've seen some other people make some cool presets with exalter, but on the other, you can literally get this decal for the price of nil from this current rocket pass: spatiotemporal literally is a low budget version of this decal. i'm assuming this is the case, given all the comments saying that exalter's already falling in price. unfortunately, their fancy exalter graphic will be stuck here for the next 48 hours. my recommendation? if you like exalter's look, buy the rocket pass if you haven't and farm items. spatiotemporal is basically a different exalter, and at the cost of close to nothing, if not literally being free.

radiant x-tempo... psyonix managed to make a new ""special"" version of a wheel... well done on this achievement. however, it's unpainted, and the unpainted version of this wheel isnt very cool looking to be honest. i suggest you not buy this version quite yet, surely painted versions will come soon...

but as usual, psyonix lacks the balls to make a shop filled with all recent and actually valuable items all at once, so naturally we get stuck with the poop-colored mantis. the mantis is a decent-ish car, but i wouldn't be caught dead with burnt sienna mantis that is most definitely past it's prime in value.

15087,"the short answer is that with arl/arr you can roll and turn your car at the same time vs only being able to do one at a time with normal air roll. essentially making you faster and more efficient with aerials. 

i was in your same position. i was a c1 that only used normal air roll. and then i discovered arl and arr. i eventually decided that i would learn arl and i did. it took a couple of days to actually get it down where i could use it in-game, but after a week or two, i was already seeing improvement. it's been like 8 months since i learned arl. i am now in gc and my aerial play has improved dramatically. all the fancy aerial plays too like air dribbles, ceiling shots, and flip resets are all much easier now. i started learning arr too. i never really use it but its nice to have every now and then.

i still use normal air roll though. in my opinion, it's better at ground play than arl/arr. i'm talking mostly about air roll shots and wave dashes, but i use it for small adjustments and recoveries as well.

i'd recommend learning arl or arr, especially if you focus more on mechanics like myself. but, you can still get to the highest level of gameplay with only normal air roll. there are plenty of pros that only use normal air roll. if you do decide to learn arl, it will be hard. i almost quit multiple times. it's a lot easier if you play on steam and have workshop maps available.",0.9943,0.006,0.812,0.183

if you dont receive the email heres the text version! 


 	 	 
 	if you played fortnite or rocket league between july 1, 2015 and february 25, 2021 and exchanged in-game virtual currency for any in-game item or purchased in-game virtual currency for use within fortnite or rocket league, you may be eligible to receive cash compensation or in-game virtual currency from a class action settlement.	 
 	for more information, visit www.epiclootboxsettlement.com.
para una notificacion en espanol, visitar www.epiclootboxsettlement.com.	 
 	this notice concerns a proposed settlement to resolve claims in the lawsuit zanca et al. v. epic games, inc., case no. 21-cvs-534, pending in the superior court of wake county, north carolina. the plaintiffs in that case have filed an action against defendant epic games, inc. (�epic games�) alleging that epic games violated state consumer protection laws, prevented minors from exercising their contractual disaffirmation rights, and negligently misrepresented the value of its in-game items in connection with its fortnite and rocket league videogames.	 
 	am i a member of the settlement class?	 
 	you are receiving this notice because epic games� records indicate that you might be a settlement class member. you�re a member of the settlement class if, at any time between july 1, 2015 and february 25, 2021, you had a fortnite or rocket league account that you used to play either game on any device and in any mode, and (a) exchanged in-game virtual currency for any in-game benefit, or (b) made a purchase of virtual currency or other in-game benefit for use within fortnite or rocket league.	 
 	what can i get from the proposed settlement?	 
 	automatic v-bucks or credits. as part of the settlement, epic games will automatically add 1,000 fortnite v-bucks to each fortnite account which was used to acquire a �loot llama� loot box, and 1,000 rocket league credits to each rocket league account which was used to acquire a �crate� loot box, the contents of which were not known before opening. settlement class members do not need to do anything to obtain these benefits.	 
 	cash compensation or additional v-bucks/credits. in addition, epic games has agreed to make up to $26,500,000.00 available to pay individuals who submit approved claims, as well as settlement administration costs, attorney�s fees and expenses, and incentive awards to the plaintiffs. you may submit a claim form for additional compensation for any real money in-game purchase(s), including real-money purchases of fortnite v-bucks or rocket league credits, that you believe give(s) rise to a claim of consumer fraud, breach of contract, or any other claim for damages. on the claim form you will need to describe how you have been damaged or harmed by your real money purchase(s) (or, if you are seeking a refund of a virtual currency purchase, the damage or harm that resulted from or related to your use or attempted use of that virtual currency in the game) and why that damage or harm entitles you to a benefit. please visit www.epiclootboxsettlement.com for more details.	 
 	you may also submit a claim form if you wish to obtain a refund for a real-money purchase you made as a minor with your own money and without parental permission. each settlement class member who submits an approved claim will be entitled to receive their choice of either a cash award (up to $50.00, in the form of a check mailed to you or direct deposit) or fortnite v-bucks or rocket league credits (up to 13,500 v-bucks or 13,000 credits). there is a limit of one claim form per videogame per settlement class member (for a maximum of 2 claim forms), and each settlement class member may receive either a cash award or v-bucks/credits for each game.	 
 	to make a claim for cash compensation or v-bucks or credits, you must submit a claim form online at www.epiclootboxsettlement.com, or print the claim form and email it to the settlement administrator at claims@epiclootboxsettlement.com, or mail it to the settlement administrator at the address provided on the claim form. a claim form must be submitted online, emailed, or postmarked by april 26, 2021.	 
 	what are my options?	 
 	for more details about your options and related deadlines, please visit the settlement website, www.epiclootboxsettlement.com, or contact the settlement administrator at 1-800-466-0862. if you do not want to be legally bound by the settlement, you must exclude yourself by april 12, 2021. if you do not exclude yourself, you will release any claims you may have, as more fully described in the settlement agreement, available at the settlement website, www.epiclootboxsettlement.com. you may object to the settlement by april 12, 2021. the detailed long form notice available on the settlement website explains how to exclude yourself or object. the court will hold a hearing on may 6, 2021 at the superior court of wake county, north carolina, 316 fayetteville st. mall, raleigh, nc 27601, to consider whether to grant final approval of the settlement, a request by class counsel for attorney�s fees, costs and expenses of up to $11,300,000, and incentive award payments of up to $75,000 total for the class representatives. the motion for these fees and expenses will be posted on the settlement website when it is filed with the court. you may appear at the hearing (which may be conducted remotely at the court�s direction), subject to the requirements set by the court, either yourself or through an attorney hired by you, but you are not required to do so. please check the settlement website for updates on the date, time, and format of the final approval hearing.

don't do things that require a lot of trust in your teammates. and expect your teammates to have no trust in you.

 there is a high ball on the wall at midfield, never go for a wall to goal air dribble. your teammate will think that is a pass and will double commit almost every time. your teammate has the ball high on the wall, expect the air dribble and don't double commit.

the only thing you can control is yourself. so you need to be the rock of your team if you want to win consistently. your touches need to be calculated, and you should never aerial for a ball that you can't do anything with.  and if you go up, you damn well better touch the ball.

try and play the midfield when on offense.you can apply alot of pressure without actually committing by just staying relevant to the play.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

so about 250 hours in (last week) i�m already at tier 244. i broke down and got the pass. i�m at 304 now and around 500 total.

15646,"in addition to what salty\_prune said, i would suggest the following in free play:

1. touch the ball somewhat slowly to the wall so that you will follow it straight up and not at an angle (this is just for practice, not doing anything towards the goal).
2. follow the ball slowly up the wall and then softly hit it with your car so it barely pops off the wall.
3. jump off the wall slightly under and behind it while keeping you car upside down.
4. touch the ball with the (upside-down) front end of your car and try to slowly keep pushing it away from the wall.
5. once you get better at this, try air rolling right-side up and doing the same thing. it should help you keep the ball up longer.

this should help you get a feel for pushing and carrying the ball in the air. and this should also help you get a feel for how hard (really, how soft) you need to hit the ball on the wall to keep it closer to you when you start the air dribble. that's where most of the mistakes happen.",0.9251,0.02,0.889,0.091

if you don�t mind, fellow diamond here, but my air roll is still shit",-0.5588,0.151,0.745,0.105
15784,"honestly, i started to notice a difference after like a week of just practicing air roll left and constantly using it in my gameplay. the main thing you wanna focus on while starting out learning arl/alr, is to focus on the hood of your car. you�ll want to move your left stick to whatever position you want your car to move. for instance, after my car turns using arl and i can see the hood of my car again, i move the left stick to the bottom right for like a half second to angle my car to the left and so my boost will be pushing me left, and i move the left stick top right to angle my car to the right and then boost in that direction. basically what i�m doing, is tornado spinning to position myself before getting up to the ball, and going towards the ball afterwards. tornado spinning is just directional air roll + moving the left stick the opposite direction of your air roll (for instance, arl+left stick right = tornado spin). i only tornado spin to help set myself up for shot via positioning my car to hit the ball in mid air. it requires lots, and lots of practice, but over time it will make a huge difference in your gameplay. 

i used this training pack every day to help me gain better control of using arl: 0483-2f50-a029-f11f

i also went on the pillars map and practiced using air roll left going around the pillars at least an hour each day, and also going into free play and going from goal to goal, making it more and more awkward for myself. 

if you have the chance, you can even go to a private match, put the game in slo-mo, and focus on the hood of your car and see what movements make your car turn which direction. you�ll get a better grasp of what i�m talking about once you actually do it. 

finally, i played lots of casual matches until i had the confidence to try it in ranked. the faster you play ranked and try air roll left/right, the quicker you�ll be forced to adjust.",0.9923,0.017,0.837,0.146

i have one example. there could be like system that detects if you leave ranked games  without ff. there also could be like bad words detect that will like lower your friendliness level and put you in game with more toxic players or even block ranked games. this system will be in rainbow six siege for new season in it. in r6  you can shoot your teammates and it's the thing that toxic player would do what is easier to detect as toxicity. i know that rl is sport game and r6 is an fps game but all multiplayer games are at some point similar to each other.",-0.0869,0.118,0.778,0.104

16344,"1. matchmaking is pretty crazy until it settles you into a proper rank, and even then there�s smurfs. nothing you can really do but it does get better over time. 


2. the tournament winner titles just mean they�ve won one of the scheduled tourneys, which you can try your luck at too since they�re for all ranks. you can absolutely buy goal explosions, either from the shop, rocket pass, or trading (probably the cheapest way). if you�re on xbox or pc i can give you a free explosion or two.


3. it happens everywhere, even in high platinum i get quitters all the time. the best solution seems to be playing with a party- also helps combat toxicity and is a lot more fun

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

it is rare that an item will go less than 1 in 12 because it is usually the color close to the default that is not available.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

i jumped back in and just played pure defense. watched the opponents to see where they were gonna hit the ball, when they were out of position and who was either slow to rotate or just plain not rotating. i used that info to punish people for three days and now i�m back in plat 3.

edit: sheeeesh reddit. in every single highlight clip, there�s someone talking shit about the play. can y�all not just enjoy a clip? no clue why i�m being downvoted when i talk back to a random guy doing exactly that ^^

edit ii: this guy is also essentially wrong, i made the right decision in this play. my teammate had a beat on the ball so i moved up. he missed, i got a save. come on reddit.

edit iii: this is possibly the most toxic community that i am a part of. everyone must point out the worst in everyone. all of my comments, even the ones unrelated to this one, are being downvoted by the brigade of people for some reason against me. you guys can�t even let a bronze post a clip (the guy who made the front page the other day, hoops clip). does it really kill you guys to not pick at every single post?

edit iv: i am going to change my statement about u/nethermorph�s comment. he is wrong. of course, when looking back at the play, you can see the correct option. there are always multiple different ways to position, some being more risky than others. the safe route was staying in the net and waiting to see what happened, while the risky, yet more rewarding, route was to push out towards the ball to try and quickly collect the result of the corner play. even though i pushed out to try and collect the ball, i still was in a position to make the save. him pointing out that my risky decision didn�t pay off shouldn�t result in him being praised and me being shit on. it seems that the higher level players are agreeing with me because they understand you can�t expect to win games playing with safe positioning the whole time. when you reach a higher rank, you have to position risky sometimes to win. you guys need to stop joining the masses and form your own opinions, because there is no way this many of you guys are just plain wrong.",-0.5661,0.123,0.762,0.114

for mechanical stuff it's fairly simple i'd say, you see someone messing something up on a regular basis, you tell them to practise specifically that thing.

the more difficult part is decision making.


at first i'd focus on one person at a time. see if you can spot decisions they make often, that lead to unfavourable situations.


for example if you see one person in your team constantly giving away ball possession for free instead of keeping control, show them in a couple different timestamps in replays what exactly you mean instead of just saying ""don't pass to opponents so much"".

it's not because the person is too dumb to understand what ""don't pass to opponents"" means, but rather to actually show them in given situations what could've been done better.

17441,"you've seen the reactions of other redditors on here when it comes to bashing teammates. 

it's funny, no matter what rank you are, you can always feel this way. there are plenty of champs thinking their teammates play like plat or diamond and there are plenty of grand champs thinking their mates play like diamonds or champs. it's always the same and it's a mentality that will just hold you back no matter what.


the thing is you tend to see other people's mistakes way easier and more often than your own. you tend to justify or overlook your mistakes while also blowing others mistakes way out of proportion in your mind.


you know, not everyone is in your rank for the same reasons you are. some people's rank may be like 90% due to good mechanics, but they have piss poor judgement or sense for rotations or team play, while others may have potato mechanics while making up for it with okayish rotations and defense. in the end the sum of it is what counts.



like others have said it's all about adapting. if you see someone constantly whiffing stuff, do more defensive rotations and be ready to have their back.

if someone tends to go for solo dribbles, give them the space and be ready when they may lose the ball or for a potential follow up.


what i'm trying to say is it's completely pointless to blame teammates for you being stuck in a rank. everyone struggles with that and this is just an unhealthy mentality that will hold you back.

17455,"that would cause another set of issues though. the game doesn't give you mmr for how you play, it only cares about wins/losses. it already gives you more mmr than it takes for a win vs a loss. if you widen that gap, and give people even more mmr for wins, think about what would happen.

every inconsistent player who goes on a win streak would shoot up the ranks and then when they hit a period where they struggle, they would be so far out of their league that they would get super frustrated but it would also make their teammates have the same frustrations as the op.

however, if they narrow the gap in the win/loss mmr change, then you have issues with people getting frustrated with not being able to progress in the game.

17456,"they don't need to change it.

>i'm saying why don't they base it off points instead of wins. as far as i understand you get the xp in game for doing good things (saves, assists, goals, etc) and lose xp for other stuff (not sure if that's true actually...).

this is a terrible idea. points mean *nothing* in matchmaking. the medals like saves and shots also mean nothing. these only indicate how much you touch the ball and in what situations. it doesn't indicate how *well* you touch the ball and if it was the correct decision to. 

if it was based off points, ball-chasers would take every chance they get to hit the ball in even worse situations than they do now just so that they rank up faster or so they don't rank down as much.

&nbsp;

the ranking algorithm doesn't have a problem. or more specifically, it doesn't have a noticeably bad problem that warrant a change. your rank is still your doing, especially in solo queue. ranking up is based on winning more than 50% of your games. if you cannot win more than 50% of your games, you don't deserve to rank up. there are key mistakes that you are making that prevent you from ranking up.",0.9412,0.061,0.798,0.141

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

i've put at least 4,000 hours into the game at this point over the past 5-6 years. granted i never did much mechanical training in all that time and focused on other things, i'm even just now learning skills that people learned early on, such as half-flipping. but if you put the effort in, you'll notice the progress and get there eventually. my advice is to pick just one thing to focus on and practice it every day if you can until it becomes something you don't have to try that hard to do. for example, i couldn't dream of hitting a double touch in-game a couple months ago. i decided i was going to go through the double tap playground pack every single day for a month or so and now i can hit them pretty consistently. stick with it and you'll get there.",0.9098,0.035,0.886,0.079

also find some youtube videos to teach you simple mechanics and rotations. rotations are key because they will make you feel less �lost� and then you can focus on making plays, not trying to figure out what you should be doing.

certainly at least from season 14 to season 1 the rank distributions changed a lot - 3s gc went from top 1.01% to top 0.18%, so the top ranks were probably a lot harder to achieve. i feel like there might have been more of a squeeze this season (possibly with some of the new f2p players dropping out, but that's pure random speculation).",0.8385,0.032,0.841,0.127

17753,"the most important thing to keep in mind is that there is no set structure for rotation. not really. it changes at every level of the game as speed and player ability increases. what may be the right decision at one rank may be a very wrong decision at the next rank, and vice-versa. you have to remember that the effective rotational strategy for any individual game is going to depend on the players. for example, when i'm playing with a high-pressure team, it's only going to work if we pressure as a group. it's all about finding rhythm with your team.

what i'm trying to say here is, really, that you should never get comfortable with your knowledge of rotation. feel confident that you're rotating well if things are working with your team. if those same strategies aren't working with them, then your rotation is bad. too often players make the mistake of feeling like it's other people who aren't rotating properly. while bad habits exist, the case is almost always going to realistically be that you think your teammates aren't rotating well because they're not adapting to your rotation, and you can't expect them to do that.

to clarify: yes - bad rotations exist, but it's not some set structure and it's important to always look back and ask yourself how you could have read the game and adapted better, because adaptability is the most important aspect of rotation.

so, to answer your questions:

> i would say about 1/5 games the other players on my team have no playmaking skills and my strength is creating for others, not myself. 

work outside of your comfort zone and become a more rounded player. look at these uncomfortable games as challenges for you to overcome. it might not be fun or comfortable, but it's a learning experience that betters you as a player.

> at what point if any do i ignore rotations and take the ball from them? 

you don't take the ball from your teammates. you make judgment calls based on the information you have at any given time after weighing the risk and level of necessity. but you don't go for things that you're unsure of because hesitation is dangerous going for uncomfortable challenges is often detrimental.

> should i just take the l so i don�t reinforce bad habits? 

no! there is no set structure. adapting to good or bad rotation is irrelevant of the fact that you're adapting to your teammates and what they're doing. what they're doing doesn't matter, but your rotation is partially defined by your response to their actions. trial and error. experience is key.",-0.9819,0.137,0.776,0.087

1) never take the ball from a teammate. you may think you are doing good because you feel confident in your play, but if your play fails due to opponent managing a save or just bad luck, you have two players in a single spot and nobody elsewhere, so the opponents have an open field and can counterattack very easily.

2) if you fail a play, don't try to salvage it. trust your teammates to grab the ball and rotate, either back to defend or forward to attack.

my brother and i trust a lot in each other, so your mileage may vary, but we notice that the hardest opponents are the ones who also behave this way. whenever we see an opponent stealing the ball from a teammate we always think ""this is gonna be an easy game"" and it always is

also did a lot of striker training. i wanted to make sure i was consistently accurate. or at least close to accurate where my partner could come in and hit it off the backboard. there are plenty of training packs, and the custom training subreddit has a stickied comment with a website full of training packs.

the last tip i have is for the corners. cbell has an 8 minute video on youtube about corner mistakes and how to fix them. it was really interesting to see the percentage of goals scored after mistakes in the corners. he also goes over a training pack to further help in practice. but just watching the video and putting into play the strategies there can really help to clear the ball and relieve enemy pressure on your side.

hopefully these help. but really, it all comes down to practice practice practice. getting consistent. and not whiffing... this last part i still struggle with. :)

if we�re to assume that you weren�t partied up, then a 250 mmr difference is actually quite unwarranted. it should never happen, especially at the most common ranks in the game. the only exceptions i can recall were when servers were getting double booked (match 1 and match 2 both connect to server 1, and one team from match 1 ends up connecting with one team from match 2, which creates unexpected matchups since they were never supposed to be there).

the only thing that makes sense to me, as blob hinted at, is the �sigma� variable that determines the system�s confidence in your rank. except this type of variance is only present in the first 10 matches in a playlist for an account **ever**. i don�t mean a player�s first 10 matches of the season, because that wouldn�t have this effect. only the first 10 games on an account, per playlist, have a variation that allows for their apparent skill rating to be that much higher than their actual matchmaking value.

a lot of people joke about it being really important but it's just a joke, i've never seen someone get aggressive about it. follow it if you like, or don't if you don't want to, it's not an actual game rule. i personally don't (i personally have more fun playing than sitting doing nothing; other people enjoy the fun silliness of a rule 1 when it comes up).

but tbh you might want to turn off chat (or only allow quick chat) if your son's young, as it can get quite nasty/offensive/racist/etc. sometimes. i personally use the 'team tactical quick chat only' option so i only see tactical stuff like 'take the shot!', but if you limit it to just quick chats you get stuff like ""nice shot!"" and ""what a save!"" too. not seeing the toxicity from other players helps me enjoy the game a lot more.

that's pretty much it.  the game isn't going to randomly start assigning you better teammates, you have to get good enough to overcome them

the simplest answer is don't get beat.  most goals in lower ranks are applying pressure until someone makes an unforced error and capitalizing, you aren't going to see many nasty flicks or flip resets.  instead of going for aggressive challenges and relying on your teammate to clean up your occasional miss or lost challenge play so that the ball never gets past you on defense",0.6293,0.146,0.679,0.176

second one is simply just flying around the ball while it's in the middle of the field. try to keep in line with the giant circle on the field that goes around the ball. you can practice a few different things here. facing the underside of the car towards the ball for the full 360 rotation, then the top of your car, then the sides. then as you get comfortable, you can try air rolling the entire time as you go around the ball.",0.9659,0.01,0.865,0.125

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

_________

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

having more control over your vehicle and knowing how the ball moves will help you hit those pesky shots more often!!

after that, the custom made training made by other players are super fun to learn from and often pretty challenging! not everyone does them the same way, some people are creative with it but they help you understand the different in game mechanics; aerials, wall movement, ceiling movements ect!

second one was a teammate that spammed ""take the shot"". this would actually surprise me if it wasn't for the fact that this happened while the ball was stuck to the wall in the middle of the field and my teammate was furiously flailing around it for 5 seconds or so. also happened after he had been chasing the ball for a long period of time.

when it comes to defense, just throw the ball away from your goal and past the opponents. your teammate will immediately boost and follow it (i see it as like throwing a ball for a dog to fetch). so they'll push the ball towards the goal. sometimes they manage to score. more often than not they're stuck against the opponents in the corner while you watch and wait for the opponents to clear the ball.",0.8818,0.014,0.893,0.093

free play and training drills.

true whiffing is 100% due to lack of car control (training drills) or bad ball prediction (free play).

there are those cases where you don't really whiff, but you fail to evaluate properly who can reach the ball first, so you go for it and an opponent gets there first and hits it past you. i don't know if there are any drills/practices you can do to help you with this.",0.0129,0.11,0.759,0.131

but the benefits of freeplay/training should be pretty logically apparent.    


until you get in to very high ranks, you can't do what you want to do with the ball in most situations.  the more time you can practice hitting the ball and getting it to do what you want, the better you will be at that.  in 3v3, you are sharing the ball with 5 other people, so the time you can spend with it is minimal.  in 2v2, you are sharing with 3 others, and in 1v1 you are sharing it with 1.  in free play, you have the ball all to yourself, so more of your time is spent learning to control the ball.    


obviously learning to read situations and play with tm8s is important too, but if you can't control your car or the ball in the ways you want to, freeplay will help you much faster than playing games.",0.9933,0.0,0.758,0.242

i recorded the results for 1 week worth of matches and only 46% ended normally with a fair result. the other 56% were down to rank disparities from people in parties or rage quits as a result of rank disparities (either my team or the opposition). i think rocket league has been losing players and money so they're funnelling people into one game mode (to keep numbers up?). means you have less fun, but i suppose it keeps the game alive.",0.8419,0.053,0.792,0.154

so squad up and you never have to worry about it again.

>tl;dr: teams of 2 in competitive 3s modes should not be allowed because usually one is ten ranks below my rank or at least one of them is no where near good enough to be in the rank they�re playing in

the only solution is to lock all ranked playlist to your group size. solo, you get to play 1v1. duo you can go into 2v2 or hoops. squad of three you can go into 3v3 and all the other modes. 

i mean you are talking about locking people out of rumble, snowday, dropshot, 3v3, and the only official tournaments where you can get rewards just because they can't find a third. so why not make it universal.

this solves your problem. this solves the people playing for the other team problem. this solves the people leaving after 1 goal problem. this solves a multitude of the problems people come here about.

so yeah solo queuers should be regulated to 1v1 if they want to play ranked. i mean it is only fair if you want to lock duo's out of the various threes modes. casual is always available to all players. find a group in casual threes, use the in game party up feature and then you can play ranked. simple as that.",0.9771,0.05,0.771,0.179

18373,"i want to preface what i'm about to say with i love lethamyr's videos and i love his maps, and he seems like an awesome guy, but i also don't like that he is basically smurfing and wins almost every match against his opponents. the only matches he's lost thus far in his road to ssl series were with jon sandman and his latest playing in gc where he got super triggered. all of the opponents he had in that series lost against someone who is, what, top 10? i understand that he's trying to get a feel for players at every rank and provide helpful tips and strategies to help those at the same rank improve, and i understand that he definitely holds back a lot of the skill he is capable of exhibiting on the field and isn't always earning mvp, but there are lot of things he does that turn the tide in a match. 25%-50% of the matches end up with the enemies just forfeiting.  
  
there are a lot of super helpful tips and hints and stuff, but i just wish there was another format where we could get the same kind of info, like rizzo and leth providing replay analysis instead. i just hate supporting the act of smurfing. i stopped watching all other road to gc and road to ssl vids, but i'm a huge fan of leth so i continue watching his...

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

18563,you're right. in some cases it can help you get better and sometimes you even do win. but playing against a smurf has gone from an occasional experience to almost being half the games i play. i'm floating around c1 and c2 right now. maybe this is just a hotspot for this kind of thing i have no idea. but in the last month alone the amount of teams i play that are like this is unreal. i don't expect it to be fixed overnight but smurfing is definitely an exploit and should be treated as such,0.926,0.064,0.739,0.198
18564,"you know how many people think they're going against a smurf and will just report them cause they think that? ""oh this guy is better than me he must be smurfing"" then he reports him. there would be so many false reports because psyonix doesn't take false reports seriously like some other games.

and what's stopping them from just creating a new account to avoid this. once they realize they're in smurf world they just create another account and continue smurfing.

and what about when they party up with a buddy who's not in smurf world? does he get pulled in as well?

your solution isn't quite foolproof. i know that smurfs and boosters are an issue but psyonix has know about these issues for years and hasn't done anything significant to combat it and i don't think they ever will. you don't see them commenting on subjects similar to this anymore.",-0.1477,0.07,0.851,0.079
18565,"i addressed the false reporting by requiring an automated system to collect stats on players similar to the additional stats on ballchasing that we do not see in game. when i see a low mmr player stunting on everyone leading the lobby by hundreds of points i can figure out pretty easily that they are not a plat 3 player who queued up ranked with his champ buddy for fun.  
the whole point of this would be to make life difficult for a smurf to discourage them from doing it. not to eliminate them completely  i'm aware that is probably an impossible task. i see people on this reddit suggesting a mobile 2fa to ranked. apparently rainbow six has this. if it works or not i do not know i've never played the game. putting multiple measures inline to make it more difficult is the idea. 

to answer your question on buddies who don't smurf. yes they would temporarily be pulled in as long as they are partied up with a flagged smurf account. when they leave that party then they can continue playing in regular servers since they are no longer partied with a flagged account.   


i never said this was a fool proof plan. its merely a suggestion to address a  real problem within the game. i'm putting it out their with hopes that someone at psyonix or in this community sees it, considers it, improves upon it, make it into something more realistic.",0.7009,0.089,0.803,0.108

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

18641,"that's cool you do all those things well. now you have to know when to do all those things well. a lot of medium level players start to do a lot of good things, but sometimes they do those things at the wrong times.

rotating back post is a great practice, but rotating back post when you have full offensive pressure is not so great. learning to fast aerial is great, but if you're doing a fast aerial to an unchallenged ball and banging it back to the opponent, that's not so great. learning to cut in to get a nice midfield pass is great, cutting in to do a midfield pass to no-one, or someone who isn't ready, isn't great. 

not saying you're doing those things specifically, but it's just an example of what i see at plat/diamond levels. so what's the missing ingredient then? adaptation is. it's a skill just as much as dribbling, aerials, rotation etc., but everyone ignores it at lower levels. learning when to make certain plays by analyzing the field properly goes a long way. and hey, i get it, it's plat, it can be unpredictable and hard to know when to do the good things and when to not, but recognizing when a teammate/opponent is going to whiff/get a bad touch is part of the adaptation.",0.9758,0.121,0.683,0.196
18642,"as a plat i relate to the fact that we all seem to hit full retard at least 3x a game. best thing you can do is be patient, play cautiously and defensively, and understand everyone you're playing with probably only has 1-200 hours in the game.

i started playing casual only as i'm relearning my controller for a new mapping, so i've played with a diverse range of leaguists. i notice my rotation seems weak when i'm playing with a diamond and nonexistent when playing with a lower plat. only semi-rarely do i find a teammate where we fall into a rotation for most of the whole game. if the rotation isn't there from your teammate, there's really nothing you can do to change them, and leaving the game isn't going to help.

since you (at least perceive that you) are the better player, take responsibility for your net. let nothing past you, and don't overextend to where you can't recover to the goal. when you clear it (if you are really that good), always set your teammate up for a potential goal. they may miss open nets, whiff, or even hit it the wrong way, but none of that matters if you have your goal covered.

long story short, slow down, take it easy, and fill in the deficit your teammate leaves when they don't drop back to defend. you can't control your teammate, but if you're good you can take control of your game. 

p.s. you may benefit from playing casual matches until you can read plat behavior better. i get stuck in the mentality you currently have and it's taxing on my sanity. tbh i've almost messed up my relationship with my girlfriend from this game. it isn't worth it. play some training lobbies, do some leth maps, and play casual, and don't worry about it.",0.9786,0.071,0.775,0.155

18730,"like the other guy said, its hard to give advice without a replay. but ill try to give you my thinking when it comes to the categories you've listed.

&#x200b;

sharp angle shots are always tough, turning off ball cam really helps me see how sharp of an angle i actually have to hit.

&#x200b;

driving in circles isnt the worst thing in the world, especially in 3s. you can apply pressure in the mid field all game and hardly even touch the ball. if i ever derank and need to get back up, i just play the midfield, making sure to never over extend. if i dont have alot of faith in my teammates, i want to make sure i can support them both on offense and defense.

&#x200b;

your going to want to be really solid at 50/50s. letting the opponent get the first touch and just reading their touch is an easy way to be sure you dont lose the 50. at worst it goes sideways.

&#x200b;

you need your aerials to be 10/10. you dont need to be fantastic in the air, but you cannot miss the ball if you go up. a missed aerial leaves you out of position for so long. it much better to just stay on the ground and read the touch, than it is to go flying to the other side of the field while wasting 50+ boost.

&#x200b;

when defending 1v1 situations all you ever have to do is shadow and be able to jump to the crossbar fast. get a feel for the defensive half and know exactly where the goal is. if the ball is high and there is no double touch incoming, dont jump and read the bounce.

dribbling and flicks... i play 3's and am dogshit at both.

positioning - this one is key, this will carry you to gc if you can work on positioning, awareness, and general field iq

50/50's are important to get good at.

aerials - can't be whiffing.  usually i'll whiff when i'm going up to challenge and they mis-hit or whiff so i look dumb lol.

defending - work on shadow defense, always deflecting to corners or where they arent.  look for outlet passes to teammates starting to rotate down field.

pass, pass, passssssss - passing makes life easier.  i randoq and basically entirely focus on passing whenever possible.  being fully unselfish to let the other people their normally selfish selves makes life so much easier.

18816,"i was the same way at first with dribbling, just could not for the life of me figure it out. finally just seemed to click eventually and i quickly starting making significant progress. a couple of things that really helped:

* if you are on pc, use bakkesmod (down on dpad in freeplay automatically puts the ball on top of your car) and also practice on dribbling workshop maps. this for me was a huge help. 
* if you have a problem where you can't seem to keep the ball up and it keeps rolling off the front of your car, you probably need to be a little more central underneath the ball.  turn off ball cam whenever you are dribbling, and try to keep the middle of your car just behind the middle of the circle below the ball.
* the biggest thing once you actually have the ball up is matching your speed with the ball.  this actually encompasses a couple of important notes.  you can't accelerate too fast or stop too fast, or the ball will just roll off your front or back bumper.  while you are first learning, don't use any boost at all, it just complicates things.  also, breaking at all will almost certainly cause you to lose control of the ball.  instead, just drive forward normally, in short and even pulses at first, to maintain a slow steady pace. if the ball starts to roll forward, hold onto the gas for a little longer, or if it starts rolling backwards, let go of it for a little longer.  then try to get back to more even pulses.  this may seem a little confusing at first, but once you start to get it in game, dribbling will suddenly start making sense and feeling natural.  once you are comfortable just driving slowly around the field with the ball on your head, you will get the feel for it and start to be able to add in boosting, stopping, and turning.
* finally, try making smaller adjustments when it starts to fall in any direction.  i know i definitely had an issue with over correcting, whether that was speeding up or stopping too quickly, or side to side turning too much, and just made the problems worse.  smaller corrections are the way to go most of the time

sorry this was long, hope it helps though.  i fully understand how impossible dribbling feels at first, but its one of those things that once you get it, it starts feeling quite natural,",0.954,0.048,0.862,0.09

18818,"to do good air dribbles you also need good car control both on the ground and mid-air. look into some training packs and free play practice. if you're on pc i highly recommend bakkes mod. sometimes i go into free play and change the game to 50-75% real time so everything is in slow motion. this allows me to work on control at a slower pace that i then speed back up to real time. after playing like that for a bit going back to real time will feel super speedy. so beware changing the time of the game can have some weird perceptive effects, but overall your mechanics will improve over time, just be patient with them, practice and experience are your best teachers.",0.9732,0.01,0.78,0.21

since the bottom of your car is always facing outward in a traditional tornado spin, if you flick the stick up, your car will adjust away from the center of the spin. if you flick down, it will adjust toward the center of the spin. but again, the actual direction will depend on where your car is in the spin. i'm currently working on learning it myself, and it takes a lot of practice.

you might want to work on changing direction while just air rolling (using air roll left or right) first. this will will help you get used to what happens when you press up or down depending on where your car is facing (also left and right, but those won't really matter when tornado spinning). it will help you with your control since there are times when you are in the air that you'll want to stop tornado spinning but are still air rolling. good luck!",0.9313,0.019,0.9,0.081

i agree that using quick chat in a toxic/ironic way can be a valid tool, they are part of the game and using them in a toxic way is not against the tos. (this was stated by psyonix in the past)

however when you are talking about typed out messages, you quickly start breaking the rocket league coc:

> respect: rocket league is at its best when all of our players view each other as equals. above all else, we expect our players to treat each other with kindness and respect when interacting in our game.

> harassment: harassment and toxicity are not tolerated by us, or our community. if anyone in rocket league targets you or another player with abusive language, racist or demeaning language, threats, or does anything else prohibited by our tou and eula, their account may be subject to discipline.

is something really a valid tactic if it is not allowed? breaking the coc is not the same as using quick chat or bumping/demoing.

if you were better than the average player at your rank, you would have ranked up. since you don't rank up, you're probably right where you belong.

i know it's a hard pill to swallow but you're literally wasting your energy complaining about random players you will never meet again. you can't improve the skills of other players. you can only improve your own.

19021,"agreed. 

rather than focusing on their deficiencies, think of it as a puzzle or a challenge to figure out how to deal with the situation and still win. it's difficult, but not impossible.

sometimes this will require sacrifices, such as playing more defensively than you might like to. typically at the earlier ranks, most players just go for the ball all the time, and aren't thinking about rotations, placement, etc. you can go a long way by just figuring those things out with the team you are on.

also, 1v1 is a great way to just focus on your own skills. it doesn't teach you how to play as a team though. however, it will remove the frustration you are currently experiencing though. i am sure you realize that.

i think everyone has a certain responsibility to take the game seriously at least. nobody is at the top of their game at all times and it's fine to make bad plays but you should always try - it's possible to be focused and trying to win when you're just vibing too.

there is a wide range between full tryhard mode and just dicking around; i think you're doing fine as long as you make a conscious effort to avoid the latter.",0.9219,0.108,0.688,0.204
19030,"well said.

that ""responsibility"" you mention is a bit of a community generated construct, and i agree that you should feel that responsibility. mainly because of the fact that the majority of players tend to view ranked matches as the ""serious"" mode and many are on a mission to improve their rank. so anyone they perceive as preventing them from achieving the next rank will be persona non grata.

there are no rules for this, but making your best effort in ranked is the considerate thing to do imo. not saying you have to be 100% all the time or the top of your game all the time, just put in a good effort.

edit: i see, you pulled the first rocket pass(2018) as an example that had alternating painted tier then certified tier. the second rocket pass made them all painted tiers.

no. if you pull uncertified crimson 3-lobe at tier 71 you will not get another chance at a certified or another uncertified crimson 3-lobe until the duplication tier (307 for this pass).

 before season 1 made special editions their own drop the same would apply to se as well. in the old system if you got crimson 3-lobe at tier 71 you didn't have a chance at crimson 3-lobe infinite until the duplication tier, which was usually around 260 because you didn't have the se drops.

now if you get crimson 3-lobe at tier 71 you have the possibility to get crimson 3-lobe infinite at tier 72.",-0.2453,0.05,0.92,0.031

_________

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

try looking back before any goals to see where the rotation crumbled. there are sometimes where there is nothing you could have done to prevent a goal, but there are also plenty of times where if you look closely try to ask what could i have done to prevent this. 

also look for some simple mistakes, one i see alot and i'm guilty myself is, when on defense players will hit the ball full send into the wall and then it just bounces back center and the opponents score when your tm8 whiffs the save. we could blame the teammate for whiffing but, the previous hit just made it harder on the others and set them up for failure. i'm not saying that you do this i'm just saying in general try to look for better options that aren't so awkward on yourself or tm8s. 

also try not to just assume booming the ball everytime you have a touch is the way to go, i see so many people just throw away possession when they could have dribbled or looked for a pass. 

these are just a few things that make up the tip of the iceberg, my honest advice is to try and stay humble and instead of getting frustrated, try to find out why things went wrong, it might be your fault or it might not, but being able to make those calls yourself will help you in the long run with quick decision making. 

so in summary, just enjoy the game and ignore the toxic players as annoying as it may be. practice and experience are your most valuable assets, and then you can push those assets further by critically analyzing your decision making. there is always something can do better. be patient with yourself and others and i promise it will pay off in the long run. hope this helps some.",0.9136,0.095,0.774,0.131

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

the only differences are with the joystick making it slightly smoother to spin in the air and doing semidiagonal flips, whereas kbm has much more precision.

in general, any advice for controller players abpplys exactly to kbm players aswell, with the exception that specific inputs requiring mechanics are going to be easier on kbm.

what i would recommend is watch leths road to ssl.

for training, what i like to optimally do is like 20 mins of leths rings with constant airroll/tornado spin, then 20 mins of dribble training 2, then go through a couple training packs varying in aerials, wall shots, shooting consistency or mixed.

then i do 30min-1h of freeplay (varying with unlimited boost or not) and/or ballchasing in casual 1s",0.8885,0.036,0.835,0.129

3. even if they do communicate well, they likely don't have good synergy.

4. even if they do communicate well and have good synergy, they most likely play often together and have reached the rank they belong for that premade. it means they got to that rank *with* that advantage, so it's balanced out by playing better players.

voice comms are not a ""huge"" advantage. it's moderate at best, but most often it's only a minor advantage. the only real ""huge"" advantage that can possibly occur is that two randoms who found they have good synergy party up and happened to both be good at communicating and choose to voice chat and play seriously. synergy with good comms and grouping with someone you just met (and thus not at that team's potential rating yet) is a huge advantage, but they will be ranked where they belong for that party soon anyway. however, this situations is very rare.",0.9609,0.08,0.755,0.166

first, i�d recommend watching leths road to ssl particularly the episodes where he�s in diamond. or even if you don�t watch i can just tell you he makes it all the way to champ without any mechanics at all. he doesn�t fly unless for a save, he doesn�t even speed flip he just forward flips everywhere, which really showed me how important positioning is. 

second, i was really fixated on spinning while flying. it looked so cool i couldn�t help it and i dropped all the way to p2. i took a break for a week and when i came back i was so much better, and played the game as a whole. so maybe you�re fixated on your own thing and a little break would fix that.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

for ground control, practice getting the ball on top of your car and keeping it there. (i find looking at the ring underneath the ball helps me keep the ball on top). once you can consistently keep the ball on your car for 10 seconds i would focus on using powerslide to make quick turns and stops while maintaining the ball on top of your car or at least close.  double touches are good to practice too. so basically, make a weak hit to keep the ball close and then quickly jump and hit the ball a second time. its also good practice if you are dribbling the ball to push the ball towards the opponents corner and not the goal. this will help keep the opponent away from the ball and allow you to quickly turn the ball towards the net if you see an opportunity to juke out the opponent,",0.9124,0.019,0.905,0.077

20042,"there is no special pool of bad players for you. teams are assigned randomly that balance out. your 'awful teammates' are your 'awful opponents' in your next game. the only constant in all of your games is you.

if you were better than the average player at your rank, you would have ranked up. since you don't rank up, you're probably right where you belong.

i know it's a hard pill to swallow but you're literally wasting your energy complaining about random players you will never meet again. you can't improve the skills of other players. you can only improve your own.

until you're ready to look at the one thing you can affect, your own performance, i'm afraid you're gonna stay where you are.

this happens when your client is out of sync with the server. typically, a desync happens when you leave a game before the post-game scoreboard. everything is correct on the server side. your game client will not update the amount of points you lost [or won] until you restart the game or complete another game in the same playlist and stay until the post-game menu.

if you lost your previous game(s), the demotion will show the next time you reach the post-game scoreboard.

now when someone reaches the ball before me, they only did so because they are better at this game. i don't think it would be fun getting beat to the ball because someone who may be worse than me picked a different car mod.

also i feel this would still be unbalanced regardless of the disadvantages you added. regardless of what your playstyle is, you also need to be able to adapt to your opponent's playstyle. so if i equip something that is helpful on the ground but my opponent has something that is helpful in the air, i am completely screwed because i will still need to aerial at some point to challenge the opponent.

20409,"short answer: casual rating was always much, much higher than competitive.

there hasn't been a casual rating reset since the game released, until the f2p release, so inflation has been going rampant. now it resets every season to roughly the gc threshold rating in competitive, but it's still going to take a long time for the rating distribution to change. that is, if it ever will, because casual rating has some other fundamental problems tied to it, such as the fact that people can just leave games and still get tons of rating when the team mates they left behind still manage to win the game. often a replacement will be thrown in pretty fast, so they fact that they left didn't really matter much for the game, and yet the game treats it as if they are now at a huge disadvantage. this is what happens when you mess with the rating for reasons other than skill prediction. u/psyonix_corey",0.7108,0.075,0.811,0.114

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

20648,"> i guess that's where i went wrong.

don't chicken out now.

so here's my problem. say i'm c3 and i have a good friend who is like d3-c1. if i play on my main, psyonix has us play on my rank, which is deeply unfair, i'll be throwing my hard-earned rating away and every game will be miserable because my friend will not be able to keep up. or i can use my second account, which is still slightly higher than his rank, but not as bad. matchmaking will be much more reasonable, i can take a chill pill if needed, and we end up with a roughly 50 % win ratio.

if it wasn't for the highest rank matchmaking, i wouldn't need to do this. but when things are made unfair, people will take measures to even out the scales, at the very least.

i'd play casual with him instead if it wasn't a pile of garbage, with non-stop leavers and extremely bad rating accuracy.  same reason i stopped playing casual for myself. you want to argue against smurfing (not op, but other people in this thread)? why am i playing against plats in casual? psyonix is now ""deranking"" me in casual every season, and there's no way i can play enough casual to compensate. that's having a far greater impact on people's match quality than me playing down a couple of ranks with my lower rank friend. if you want to complain to someone, complain to them.",0.9726,0.106,0.69,0.204

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

learn to hit the ball right after it bounces, without flipping. practice in freeplay, hit it off the wall to yourself over and over. start with a rolling ball, hit it off the wall, turn around and give yourself plenty of distance to the ball, and then take another run-up, a nice easy run-up as straight into the ball as you can. repeat until you get bored. over time you can start turning closer and closer to the ball and time it with the bounce. this is mechanically more difficult, so in games, know your limits, and make things easy for yourself. practice the difficult stuff in freeplay.

 - people would try and start bullying their teammates to leave the match. or possibly ddosing their teammate making them leave the game so they don't have to face a loss.

a lot of people will suggest you some training maps and to do more freeplay (and they are right) but for the tactic side you should take a look at coaching video to work on the most important thing in rl: positioning. after hundred and hundred of hours on this game, playing on elo between silv and diam, i came to the (obvious) conclusion that the thing which screw most of the games is bad positioning / rotation.

also, if you missed the ball a lot, your controller, your camera and sensibility settings, and your button mapping could be involved, and for these problems, i suggest you to look at the settings suggested by pro coaches / pro players (on liquipedia rl).

and finally, focus on the few things you can do right on the pitch. the first thing will be to hit the ball right, then defending right, then positioning, then powershot, then flying, passes, recovery, flicks, etc. take the needed time to train the few basics one after another, cause the point is not for you to be a fast learner but you to enjoy the game with your progress.",0.5542,0.069,0.842,0.089

essentially, only using the air roll button, you're only able to either rotate your car or change directions in the air. to put it differently, when using the air roll button your left thumb is only able to control the axis in which you are rotating on, rather than the physical direction (like rotating without air roll.) while on the other hand, directional air roll allows you to do both at the same time, because your left thumb would be moving the cars direction (without air roll) while you simply press the air roll left button, it wouldn't be taken up by putting in the direction of your air roll manually.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
21164,"it's just unfair all around. because not only did the leaver on your team give you less mmr. but gave the enemy team more mmr points. but it would be major abuse to have all players not win any points.

so what if the leaver leaves, they drop one division.

 the players who stayed get mmr points. according to the end score.

which means whoever has more points gains more mmr.
if the team that had the leaver scored more goals, then they'd get more mmr points than if the other team who didn't have a leaver scored more.

yet, if an entire team leaves, they lose the same mmr points as if they'd loss.

this works in 2's as well as 3's. because even if two people leave in 3's, the third would stay and gain mmr points, while the 2 leavers would be punished accordingly.

of course, if there happens to be a 1 v 3 and the one loss, that one player would earn more mmr  than if two people stayed and they loss. but not by much more.

and if a player happens to leave on both sides of the team, so that a 3v3 turns into a 2v2 or a 1v1, then all the leavers get punished and the players left get mmr as if they played a normal game.

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

keep the ball in the center of the field and keep ball cam on. hold air roll and fly in a circle around the ball

free play. ik everyone says that but for real. its massively important.

another big one is think about what you're doing at all times. might sound like a ""duh"" thing. but i mean literally like commentate on what you're doing to yourself so you can tell yourself at times like, ""oh i should've rotated earlier. people tend to hop on and just play on auto pilot too much, and when you do that you wont really improve much.

a couple small suggestions would be to look on youtube for training packs at your level. just take 10 or 15 minutes a day to do some. also try to find people plat 3 - diamond 1 to play with. playing with people slighty above you can really help show where you need gaps in your play filled in.

but just so you have a benchmark: i have yet to calibrate this season, but i was a high plat in 2s last season and could probably have breached diamond if i actually tried (just calibrated and played another 2 or 3 matches.

i don't know where i'd be put this season, but i'm still a high plat in hoops and dropshot and can probably breach diamond if i practiced more.

i can probably do 70%-90% in any of the standard all star training courses with no more than 1 reset per shot and that's mostly it. i can't freestyle, i can't dribble, i can't do consistent wall aerials. all i can do is be somewhat consistent with high aerials way above the crossbar. 

i have about 200h into this game, most of which were more than 3 years ago. to get to high plat and probably get to low diamond, all you have to do is be consistent with the basics: car recovery, simple aerials, how to properly 50-50, and have a rough estimate of which balls to go for.",0.7446,0.041,0.893,0.066

21678,"hey, i don't have enough info on what you play when you are in rocket league. it can be a lot of things that might slow your improvement down like f.example spending too much time in freeplay and training, or you might be spending too much time in matches with little trainging beforehand. i see a lot of people grinding freeplay for hours every day trying to learn 1 mechanic, but this won't help you nearly as much if you try to hit the ball hard and reading ball-bounces in freeplay. you should try to find a balance that you like with training and matches. before i play matches in-game i normaly warm up with 20 min freeplay and a trainingpack to improve my speed and consistency.   


and to answer the other question, you will eventually find good teamates when you play ranked, be nice and ask for a party-up if you think that you played well togheter, and by doing this you will find yourself playing with better teamates when you are on instead of solo qing.

21680,"if you're looking to improve your car control in the air, practice in freeplay by keeping your car in the air without holding air roll. you'll want to be able to move around easily with your wheels facing away from you and with the wheels facing towards you. once you can fly forward and reverse, keep the ball in the middle of the field and turn on ball cam. then fly around the ball with out using air roll. you can also get good at flying while holding air roll the entire time by doing this same method. for defense, you should focus on power hits. hitting the ball directly after it bounces on the ground let's you put a lot of power behind it. shadow defense would also be extremely useful to practice, just watch the video to learn more.

use ""tactical quick chat"", it only allows useful quick chats from your team to go through. you won't see any typed out messaged and you won't see ""nice shot!"" but it still allows you to see ""take the shot!"" etc. that should get rid of all, or at least a lot, of the toxicity.

> also i've been losing a lot of my games, around a quarter of the games of my sessions, because of teammates afking or just straight up abandoning when were down 2 goals with like 3 and a half mins left. also some teammates would just score own goals on purpose and would spam the chat because i made 1 mistake.

i mean, that is unfortunately but also extremely unlucky. not much you can do except trying to find teammates to play with (reddit or discord are good for that) or hoping for a bit more luck.

similarly, at the highest level air rolls in the air hide your intentions better. they might hit it hard or they might get a flip reset.

some people for good or bad just twist the entire time in the air.  he used air roll in a very useful and effective way.",0.9048,0.059,0.803,0.138

22198,"adapting to your teammates and compensating for them is one of the most important skills in the game. if your teammates knew how to rotate better, they'd be at a higher rank.

most people do rotate to a certain extent, what is perceived as ""proper rotation"" just changes drastically from rank to rank.

rotations aren't set in stone. good, high level rotations are the result of all players on a team making the correct desicion for each individual situation. formations and rotation-tutorials are good pointers, but mostly serve to make a certain point, they're not really step-by-step tutorials.all competitive games usually evolve complex strategies that could never be covered in basic tutorials. i'd argue that  figuring stuff out while you're improving is one of the best parts about competitive games.

for me, changing my mental approach helped a lot. try not to limit your desicion making to ""i'll just play defensive then"" and be more active on the field. if done correctly, you can still cover for your teammates while pushing up and playing fast. try to actively create pressure where you can, figure out when it's safe to commit and when it is absolutely necessary to cover the backpost or the backboard. playing defensive doesn't necessarily mean sitting back and waiting for your chance.

your desicion making will improve massively, your rank will improve and you'll have more fun when you're not limited to your own half or goalkeeping.",0.9954,0.021,0.735,0.244

leaving a defensive position to push for a goal oppoutunity and finding that both of my team mates have also pushed up.

22206,"the thing is, your teammates are at the same rank as you; they have rotations that are appropriate for that rank - as do you. if they had better rotations or positioning, they would be a higher rank, so you can't really expect them to.

if you push up when your teammates are also pushing up, you already made a mistake. just sitting in goal is also a bad desicion in most situations, unless you already have a teammate challenging the opposing striker - this just opens you up to a 1v3 when your teammates inadvertendly give up posession.

good positioning isn't just about sitting on defense while your teammates chase, you can cover for them and pressure the opponents at the same time in a lot of different ways. the key is figuring out what you *can* do while covering a counter-offensive without overcomitting.",-0.0516,0.055,0.884,0.061

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

1. turn off camera shake, but if you like it on then keep it on. it does make hitting the ball a little more difficult, which is why it's not liked in the community.

2. ball cam, is your friend. as a brand new player i would suggest keeping it on at all times, as it will make knowing where the ball is at all times. eventually you'll toggle between it on and off, but for now leave it on.

3. mess around with the camera settings, if you haven't already. again that will make the game easier for you to look at and play. if your not sure of where to start with camera settings go [here](",0.8785,0.093,0.76,0.147

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

your client and the server both calculate the game at 120hz but they communicate at 60hz. if the client side is out of sync with the server due to high ping or anything else, the game uses the data from the server to correct client side interactions and graphics. thats why if you play on high ping servers, even though to you, the ball was just smacked to their side, the server goes ""nah mate, you missed it"" and will correct the path of the ball and it'll shoot behind you like you just whiffed.",0.2313,0.065,0.864,0.071

it used to be like you're describing, with ranks averaging out. this creates a massive advantage for the premade team, as a high level player can easily carry games in lower ranked lobbies, no matter what rank his teammates are. also, it makes it much easier to boost players above their skill level.

the way it currently is, the disadvantage is entirely with the premade team; this also counteracts the advantage they gain for being premade.

edit: the only change i would welcome is a limit for rank disparity for 2-player teams in 3v3 games, as this can affect the experience of their solo teamamtes (no limits for rank disparity for fully premade teams). it's not a big problem at the moment, but it would be a slight improvement that doesn't have too much impact on premade teams.",0.9572,0.036,0.795,0.169

with that said, lets address the question i suggested you asking instead. why should you only ask what the best car is for a certain hitbox? as stated above, different cars may have different hitboxes, and are more suited for different playstyles and preferences. after you have grouped together the cars with the same hitbox, there is going to be appearance differences among the cars, and thats where you should ask what the best car is. take the scarab and octane for example. they both have the octane hitbox, but at a glance does it really seem like they share the same hitbox? with the octane you can, generally speaking, perfectly balance the ball on top of the octane while dribbling. does the task of balancing the ball on top of the scarab even look possible in the first place? it is in fact possible, but it just doesnt seem like it. the community can tell you which cars feel like they best represent their hitboxes so you can confidently know what properties your car has compared to others just by looking.",0.9934,0.013,0.791,0.197

taking advantage of training packs is huge. i tell all my new friends who hopped on to try all the custom packs and finish them in one sitting. once you�ve scored them all, go for harder shots with the same set up (mess around with air rolls and hitting the ball harder).

one of the big differences in players at the plat/diamond level is rotation and hesitation. if you hesitate, you should immediately pull back. if you�re not first to the ball your screwing your team mate behind you. lots of players cut to attack the ball as they rotate back to defense which is also a bit no no.

however, they may siphon me out of the 400 cr for tw toon hydro... they must be regretful that they gave that away for free, one of the higher quality ""meme"" trails in the game. gonna wait for my boi dylbobz to live review the item shop to see if i will actually take the plunge. unpainted hydro is super clean, but does the tw effect ruin it or keep it as or even cooler? feel free to elaborate below if i don't find out soon enough from dylbobz on youtube

in gold most people seem to go fast only when driving the ball towards the other goal or running back to their own net in panic defense mode.

23312,"speed is over rated in early ranks. i got out of gold and through plat by being smarter and picking my spots. 

i�d recommend focusing on your rotations in 3s. and most importantly make sure you�re never going for the ball as last man back. unless you know a teammate is rotating behind you. 

there�s really only 3 possibilities. shooting, passing, and waiting. if you�re on ball with a chance to make a shot, take it. if you�re on ball with no shot, get it up the wall or off the backboard to set up a pass. if your teammate has it, trust them to make a play either on their own or to set you up. be ready to take the shot, if they lose control. if you�re last back, only cut through rotation if it�s a guaranteed goal or hit into the other teams side. i�m high plat and still see so many people last back trying a hard contested shot after one teammate is up the wall and the other just missed a shot. meaning, if they don�t win the 50/50 or score, the other team has a huge advantage for counter attack. 

for mechanics. there really isn�t a bad one to focus on. but speed flips or dribbling won�t get you out of gold. smarter play will. focus on going all in, when you�re attacking. if you�re going for an aerial, make sure you�re the first off the ground. stay aggressive. and learn basic wall and backboard clears. 

that said, i�d say dribbling is the best option. that emphasizes ball control which is always good to have.",0.9697,0.062,0.796,0.142

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

ball out in front of our net one tm8 alone at the other end of the field doing god knows what.

me at back post (no power-up ready). 

my 2nd tm8 goes up for the ball with 3 defenders sitting in front of him. he barely gets to it, hits it backward right at our net. you can guess the rest! 

that same 2nd tm8 goes all toxic with what a save, and it's not in a self-deprecating manner.

there might be no more deadly mistake in all of rocket league than to leave one tm8 in a 3v1 in rumble right in front of your net, and hit that ball for the the other team toward your own net. i've played enough rumble to have survived this very situation before, but you literally have to be mentally unstable to be toxic should the ball go in.

i default to ignoring these tm8's completey now, i don't acknowledge anything they say or do negatively throughout the rest of the game. they can try to bump me into oblivion looking for a response, i just play on!

edit: i should mention, if my tm8 does something like this and says 'sorry', i default to say 'no probelm', and try to show them though my play that it's really, no probelm. it's amazing how being positive can lift the play of those teamates, rather than being toxic, which only makes things worse for all!",0.9215,0.081,0.795,0.124

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

the points system doesn't quite work for me however. i might have a stellar game, then play like a potato. and depending on my teammates, if i get the aforementioned team, i generally hang back at goals because it's too risky to play with everyone out when the third player is useless. and if i have two teammates, that may or may not be in a party, and playing well together, i hang back a bit to not get in their way and mess up their rhythm. i read the field and play to the conditions essentially.

but i agree, it's competitive. if you wanna play with your bronze mate, cool!... go play in casual where it doesn't impact my rank! i have struggled for years trying to get platinum, and now i'm struggling to get to diamond because of who i get teamed up with.

i'm a mid-range plat getting teamed up with a diamond and gold, then we lose to teams of 2x plat 3's and a plat 2, or a diamond 1 and a couple of plats. and that's if my crappy teammates don't decide to forfeit after the first goal is scored against us with 3+ minutes left on the clock.

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

your rank is determined by your mmr, a hidden numeric value. there are exact thresholds for every rank/division. you gain and lose a certain amount of mmr (usually around 9-10 points) for every win or loss.

mmr is a bit more volatile during someone who is playing the first ranked games of a season. the amount of mmr gained and lost during the first couple of matches is significantly higher than it would normally be. i'm not sure about the exact number of matches it takes, but it's ussually not that long.

1. make a new account, then trade all the items you want from your old account to the new one. you may have to trade something in return, so in that case just trade your garbage items, 10 creds, etc. this might get complicated if you need 2 xbox's, maybe have to borrow a friends console to get the trade rolling.

2. reach out to psionyx support, ask them to reset your rank. this is a total shot in the dark, but it can't hurt to try. i did this back in college when i played league with a buddy who was way better than me, and also in starcraft. unlikely, but psionyx support has been very helpful for me in the past.

3. bite the bullet, disable chat, and spend an afternoon losing 20 games in a row. sucks, but it's a one-time thing and it will solve your problem permanently.",0.9246,0.059,0.788,0.153

i underystand this is a frustrating situation, but your problems are 100% self-inflicted and somewhat easily fixed - you apparently understand this too. the easiest solution for you would be to kick your roomie off your account and  just loste enough games to get ranked appropriately - it sounds like it is your xbox, so it shouldn't be a problem.

of course it's not that easy if you want to avoid a fight, as your rommate put many hours into that account, but he is at fault for this too. he was fully aware he was playing on somebody elses account the whole time and should have recognized this as a major issue when he started to surpass you. if you really want to get back into playing again, just talk with him about getting your account back, i'm sure you can compromise over items.

after all, he also is having a much harder time than necessary to rank up, this problem goes both ways.",0.8137,0.099,0.75,0.151
24094,"imho with the players i've coached that have gone through the barrier your talking about or farther it was the conscious choice to dedicate focus in improvement while they play. not just putting in hours or grinding aimlessly for a rank, but putting aside that 2 hours a day to work on their absolute worst techniques or skills. 

as a quick example i had a player that i worked up to b+ but was stuck there after making it and wasn't able to make the jump to a, his decision making was very clear and reliable and didn't have bad mechanics, but the biggest thing he didn't have was the ability to do more after his play, or how to make the most of a play that didn't suceed. for him improving the after thought of his airdribble and who he was going to bump which boost he was going to steal or where he would place himself for a redirect after dropping a wall to air dribble was the focus. for about a month he focused solely on focusing on the opponents positions and focusing on the recovery from his solo play rather than overcommiting on a low chance of 1 v 2 ing the opponent defenders. 

the mindset he had to set aside his ranked mmr and even 6mans record in order to achieve this is what i think allowed him to make it into rank a more than anything i told him about advanced decision making or proper recovery after failure,  yes i pushed him and helped to get there faster but he would have done it anyway without me givin a few more months",0.9657,0.069,0.785,0.146
24095,"that is a very good point that you�ve mentioned it, i don�t mean to sound cocky or anything but i�m not too sure what i�m worse at, i mean i would go into freeplay or training packs and do whatever like ariels, flip resets etc but if someone said to me �what is the thing you suck at the most� i honestly wouldn�t be able to say

thing is i know there is something that i�m worse at but when i�m playing we don�t see it, i never watch my replays back either, which i probably should. i haven�t really thought about being coached before but i always want to improve and become a good player. 

i forgot to mention that i play everyday for at least more than 2 hours, sometimes even 4 or 5 a day so i�m definitely on to date with the game, but it sometimes feels like the more i play the worse i get, this usually happens if i�m having a bad day haha.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

highlights are automatically removed by a bot if you made more than 1 per 24 hour. this is a fully automated process. if this happens by mistake you can send a moderator message so we can take a look/reapprove the post. (there is a link to do so on the comment the bot left.)

also, the ""highlight"" flair is mostly meant for short gampelay clips. stories about ranking up should preferably be flaired ""fluff"" or ""discussion"". however i can agree this may not be very clear to all users.

> this is extremely ridiculous because the server only benefits from activity

we made the one highlight per 24 hour rule, because some people would spam upload their clips. since we already have a bunch of users and get a bunch of clips, we felt the need to limit this number somehow to not have the subreddit flooded in even more clips.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

second, needing only 2 more to rank up is false, especially when your at div 4 about to move up.  this is because the website is setup wrong.  it is basing the rank up off the minimum rating you could have at the higher rank, when in fact you can't rank up till you get closer to div 2 of the next rank.  so this is why it is approximately \~2 to division up but not necessarily correct - since this is unofficial information.

your own fault. cheating up is the play in 2s if you're the second man on the kickoff. don't go for back corner boost, that's only a good move in 3s (unless you know your tm8 really well, and can trust them not to botch the kickoff)",0.9647,0.051,0.717,0.232

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

not the greatest or most guaranteed way to play but in those moments i found that it helps if you clearly state you�ll cover the defense and hope they focus on the attack enough. there will hopefully come a point where both opponents will commit at once and if you clear that ball, it�s open net.

the op's tm8 was mistaken, imo, as left first applies to tm8's evenly lined up, not staggered. (with staggered, closest goes first)

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

24977,"as a plat, i'm just getting consistent with aerials without air rolling.  i can air roll to redirect but not consistently enough to go spinning around, just redirecting angles by rolling sideways and such.

one thing you might notice though if you watch pro matches. they don't air roll that much.  they go directly to the ball and only air roll when its absolutely necessary.  i figure its just efficiency, get to the ball as fast as possible, if you are positioning properly you shouldn't need to redirect much in flight.

forget air rolling, just work on hitting shots.  spend as much time as possible working on that if you want to win games.

two biggest tips for you at your level.  pick up boosts, keep your speed up, and try to keep your nose up when popping up to hit a ball.  don't flip into it unless you have to.  train yourself to hit pop up shots with the front bumper and you'll get better at shooting faster.

24979,"air rolling just helps you move your car about a different axis.

although the shortest distance to the ball is the straight line leading up to it, that�s not always the most efficient way to hit the ball.

let me give you few scenarios:
- the ball is in front and above the goal. for this, you can fly above the ball and air roll yourself to be in a better position to shoot the ball downwards. this would give more power and control
- you�re on the wall with the ball next to you but not in the line for a flip to hit it. you can single jump, air roll to position yourself and flip into the ball.
- in an attacking position, you might not always expect a pass. if you�re in an awkward angle you can fly and air roll to get yourself into the right position to shoot (applies to defense as well)
- air roll isn�t just about the flying aspect, it is also crucial for your recoveries.

air roll is not necessary. you can play well in ~plat without air roll. but it�s a new axis of rotation that gives you more freedom for whatever you want to do - the better you are at utilizing that, the higher you can go. i use the air roll button, my brain can�t understand directional air roll yet i�m in champ 1 with no restrictions so far.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

my tv automatically switches to game mode when it detects my ps4. maybe that was the case for your ps4 as well and for some reason isn't for your ps5. so check if it's activated.

ps5 performance mode

pretty sure you can set your ps5 to performance mode in the settings to favor performance over resolution. while both should ""just"" give you 60 fps in rocket league, performance might lower your input lag.

first, binding the right stick to left and right roll, makes things so much more friendly, but then you got to set the swivel speed to 1... 
#there is no 0!?

next, the camera follow function is also locked on a delay and takes a while to move to where your car is travelling. so if you are traversing a space, the camera doesn't act like it does on the ground. aka, follow the car's primary nose direction and direction of travel.

if you flip the car forward and hold left roll, the car will roll to the left, and then when it is upside down, switch and roll to the right. this means that you have to compensate for the shift by flipping forward, holding left roll and then hold right roll. the most unintuitive thing i have ever seen. no patch for this at all. no option to change it.

such a large part of the game is how you handle in the air, and literally the worst control set up i have ever seen for a game that has full binding functionality.

\- once you buy rp you'll be able to collect 15k xp from 24 premium season challenges (including currently unavailable stage 4), which will give you 360k xp or 18 xp levels (if you complete them all, obviously)

\- if you buy rp **right now**, during this week, there will be 3 more premium challenges every week, each worth same 15k, so 4(3 x 15k) = 180k xp or 9 xp levels

\- there are 2 free weekly challenges, 10k xp each, and free challenge at stage 4 worth 20k xp, which makes it 4(2 x 10k)  + 20k = 100k xp or 5 xp levels

\- completing every challenge from now on (weekly ones + remaining ones from stages 1-3 + ones that will be available at stage 4) will give you **32** xp levels

\- after tier 66 every completed match will grant you 80% more xp (70% at tier 40 tho)

\- also *daily wins* give you additional 2000 xp (don't quite remember how many *daily wins* are there, but at least 2 for sure)

\- you will get every credit back once you hit tier 110

\- everything you get after tier 70 (pro tiers) you can trade for credits

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

music is subjective in whether someone likes it or not, so therefore it's impossible to give each rank an ""accurate"" anthem without being offensive to one group or the other

naturally all the people that hate player anthems dread the thought  of a player anthem comp reward, and there's a 0.,0001% chance they may actually be that masochistic, but i'd wager that a ge/wheel/decal is more likely on the menu for season 2.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

additionally, this person does not owe you an explanation of their identity. queerness is not a novelty to be poked at with a stick or observed in a zoo. this person has no obligation to explain their profile picture or talk about their sexuality with you. but by asking a question like this, you are assuming they have such an obligation. 

you may not have realized the immense weight that queer people carry or why queer people are triggered when other people treat their identity like tchotchke. but i hope you can reflect on this. 

and ask yourself�why is it a question you asked in the first place? was it to get to know this person, or to validate a preconceived notion you have about gay men?

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

so for instance, if my teammates were ball chasing i would just try to stay back and play a more passive, supporting style. if one of my teammates was staying back more i would play more aggressive etc. just try to play to your teammates strengths, otherwise your gonna be spinning your wheels for years and be getting yourself worked up.

## 1. posts should be directly related to rocket league

the subreddit is built around the physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by psyonix, and as a result every post should be directly related to the game. posts about similar games, posts that are only tangentially linked (e.g. images of painted wheels because rocket league has colored customizable items), and similar submissions are not permitted.

if the title is the only part of the post that is rocket league related, it will be removed under this rule.

during meme day on saturdays from 00:00 to 23:59 utc restrictions imposed by this rule are loosened.

26642,"1. freeplay - run/jump/fly around the map, try to make uncomfortable positions and try to recover from them. recovery is a crucial element in rl.
2. workshop - try ""shooting consistency"" (for shooting in various ways), ""wallshots"" or ""wall play"" (to get better at controlling your car on wall/ceiling and in the air), ""backboard therapy"" (for shooting uncomfortable but very efficient shots coming from a pass or a missed shot), ""shadow defense"" (to get better in defending when you are facing your net and the ball is behind you), ""wall pinch"" (this is just a plus but its fun to get to know some other ways to score using the wall)
3. watch youtubers or streamers that give tips, they are mostly good at the game, but not nessecarily pros (i'll get back to them in a sec), they will give great tips, for example: how to rotate, when to cut rotation, how to do various mechanics (preferably not advanced stuff, those will come later, but mechanics like wavedash, half-flip, airroll). watching pros is great and you can get great ideas from their playstyles but they are just way too fast and good to really get the most important things that you need right now.
4. improve your vision (periferical sight) by watching your teammates and enemies in normal (this way you won't lose rank and you won't throw the game for your team), watch what are they doing, where are they, are they in your field of view, if not where can they be and what would their next move be. this will help a lot in rotation, and in basic gameplay. you won't ballchase that much, you might get overdefensive(!) which you need to wear off, because being overdefensive is just as bad as being a ballchaser. try to get a middle ground between those two.
5. try 1s, solo skills improve your skills in 2s or 3s, but they could make you either a ballchaser or an overdefensive player yet again.
6. once you can do halfflips and wavedash try them back in freeplay (recovery!) and try to chase the ball by doing those mechanics, (this 6. point is where i am right now d1 in 3s, p2 in 2s, p2 in 1s) this is the point where you are getting the jist of the game and you can see great development in your gameplay.
7. also try to airroll with the ball, make wall/ceiling plays in freeplay mode, it doesn't matter if you can't shoot them on target just keep trying, you'll get there eventually.
8. after 7. point you'll need confidence but never forget the middleground(overdefensive/ballchaser). you need to believe that you are the best on the field but most players are just a tiny bit below your skills. (its kind of a mental helper) so you can keep your confidence up and not be toxic in the meantime.
9. at this point you've accuired great ball and car control. this is of course only my assumption but i think this is how you get up to high champ / low gc.
10. of course as i mentioned in 9. this is only plan as well in the future. at this point you need to fasten your game, but you need to know how and when to slow down as well. (you'll get experience in grandplat and diamond about fakes, how to be good at slowing down when the heat is up when you are the goalie and you need to slow down to save a shot) so you'll probably end up in this 10th step in high gc when everything is really, really working as it is planned out.
11. we don't talk about ssl that's another breed.

i might lack experience and just misslead you, if i do i apologies, but this is how my plan looks like. i started at the end of november last year and in january i reached diamond 1 (peaked at diamond 1 div3) in 150 hours of gametime (weird flex, i know :p but it's just to support my plan), as of now it has been working and i don't plan on quitting this. gl on grinding and getting better at the game!",0.999,0.038,0.782,0.18

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

26840,"it�s definitely a hard task relearning new bindings but the default ones are horrible so it�s definitely worth it. for myself (and most people i know and play with on ps4) do the following:

starting from default controls,

1. change boost to r1 - this will allow you to more easily boost and jump at the same time. 

2. i got used to air roll being l1 but the default for that when i first started was square and apparently default now is l2 so that one is up to you. i don�t see l2 being detrimental especially if you are already used to it. 

3. a lot of people i know also like to change the power slide from square to l1 as well. i kept mine as square and it�s not much of an issue for me. 

4. if you decide to do l1 for either 2 or 3 then you will have to change your scoreboard bind. i have mine as circle. 

5. if you pick r1 for boost then you will have to change your bind for resetting a shot in training/free play. i just made it one of the d-pad directions, circle would work too. 

essentially, the big one is changing your boost button to a trigger and the one that made most sense for me was r1. it will free up your thumb to allow you to swivel/look behind or jump while boosting which is essential to beating other players in aerials.",0.9901,0.036,0.78,0.183

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

positioning, rotation, and field awareness will absolutely pay more dividends then learning fancy mechanics as a lower ranked player.  your cute air dribbles that get wins against those that can't defend it at plat/diamond will get stuffed beyond.  and if you don't have the fundamentals and intangibles down then you're stuck.

i got gc without ever even trying to learn air dribbles, double touches, blah blah blah.  and to be honest, i still rarely do air dribbles except for certain situations... same with double touches.  still haven't bothered learning ceiling shots or flip resets.  easily get gc every season still. (i dont go for ssl as i dont have much time to play anymore).

if anything the exact opposite needs to be championed.  the amount of players that just do 1v3 solo plays that fail every time any time they are near the ball are just abysmal to play with. 

people, learn to pass, learn to properly rotate, take the blinders off and see where people are the field.  no your 5th failed flip reset isn't helping your team.  your infinite kuxir twist for every aerial leading into a whif or some dogshit touch doesn't help your team.  1v3 dribbles when you clearly can't win it dont help your team - especially when you have easy passing options and just choose to ignore them.",-0.1531,0.139,0.736,0.125

pushing the jump button longer makes you jump higher.

if you have a player with the name of a bot any bot that joins afterwards will take a different name.

in rumble if you use the grapple just as someone scores you'll start spasming violently.

in rumble if you use grapple in a way where a wall is nearly between you and the ball you can have a desync where client side the game thinks you used it without actually using it.
there's some weird effects it can cause, but for the most part it's just confusing. the easiest way to recreate this is by being in the goal wall on the side from which the ball is sliding towards the goal and spamming the use item button as the ball comes over the corner.",-0.6757,0.066,0.911,0.024

watching a few road to ssl videos for all of diamond and a few champ can help with the decision making. if they are available for the playlist you want to improve. johnny_boi replay review channel is also a good source. find some diamond and champ reviews, these videos will help with decision making and positioning.

## 9. no witch hunting and content showing toxic behavior

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

second i would say is practice simple mechanics like off the wall stuff and aerials. if you master that you'll be a really fast player.


and third it may seems contradictory but learn how to slow the game down both in the sense of take your time if you have no one around you keep the ball close you don't always have to bang it (don't over dribble but knowing when to do what will come with time) and also slow it down in the sense of think about your next move and your opponents next move see what angel hes going towards the ball and see how you can win the 50 see if he's turning his car a little so you can bang it check to see if your gonna beat him to the aerial and if not can you get a touch on the ball after his hit

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

witch hunting is against reddit�s site-wide rules and it is a policy that we think is very important to grow a healthy community. do not use the subreddit to publicly shame or accuse someone. posts containing toxic behavior are only allowed if they serve a greater purpose (for example in combination with a suggestion) and if all usernames are censored. do not post content showing toxic behavior if the sole point is to show off toxic behavior.

posts on public figures and organizations are allowed, as long as they are kept civil and do not include personal/confidential information, and if there has been official confirmation (for example from a player�s team) or if there is substantial evidence to support it.

opponent c would try to rotate back post but do to b taking his boost he shouldnt have time for that, before you shoot.",0.6999,0.055,0.851,0.094
27956,"so i'm assuming you're implying that you're player d and the ball is high up in their corner? assuming you get to the ball before their player in the corner and can get a clean hit you have a couple options.

1. hit the ball so that it rolls along the back wall over goal and hopefully the defending player that is rotated to goal doesnt get a good clear. this is probably what you're used to doing and is starting to not work in plat. this is definitely the expected move and the weakest option and will continue to get weaker as you move up in rank and the opponent defends on the backboard.

2. hit the ball so that it bounces off the back wall and goes out a little bit in front of goal. this is just the same thing as 1 but with better control. it's definitely going to make it harder on the defender but once again will be  defended more readily the higher you go in rank. however, it could be a good solution if your team is in position for a pass or the opponent isn't positioned well in goal.

3. bang the ball *up* instead of across. especially in plat and even diamond/champ, this option could work really well. mid level players can't read ceiling bounces well and it might even be able to hit ceiling and then ground before they read it, giving your team ample time to take the shot. the great thing is that depending on the situation, it's probably an easier hit to aim than option 2.

4. the final option is a little less specific but is ""keep possession and react to the opponent."" this could end up being option 1, 2, or 3, or it could be something different. it could be hit the ball backwards to your teammate, it could be go for a ceiling shot out of the corner, it could be wait for the opponent to go for it and get a good 50, it could be go for a series of bumps and let the ball roll out to a teammate that's behind you. however this is generally the option that you're going to need to get good at. there's no 1 good option, even in plat. and even if there was one skeleton key hit from corners guaranteed to score on plats - what happens when you rank up and now always go for the same corner option against opponents that can beat that option? 

i would say to make option 4 into a less broad concept, just try not to pass it to the opponent that's in goal. most of the time the best thing you can do in rocket league is simply not doing the *worst* thing. so if you can avoid giving up possession by whiffing or accidentally passing to the opponent or whatever else, you've succeeded.",0.9138,0.067,0.85,0.082
