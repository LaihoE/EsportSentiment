they should have done what battlefield did. having the same map resized for each game mode and player counts. mw maps to me doesn�t really has a complexity problem, lanes are still defined but have more routes to move around. what it has size and player-count incompatibility problems. there is no reason for grazna raid or arklov peak to be in 6v6�s rotation if they didn�t even bother to resize it.",-0.9125,0.158,0.774,0.068

reducing graphics settings helps a little but not by nearly as much as one would expect, i probably need to do some testing with better diagnostics tools, i wouldn't be surprised if there is some kind of garbage collection or freeing up of vram going on

 i bought cold war without really thinking of it (i hardly ever watch prerelease videos or anything like that), and instantly regretted it. if they would have just continued to update mw19 for another year i couldn't have been happier. oh well. lesson learned. until they put out another game on an engine like mw19, i just won't be buying it.",-0.9827,0.189,0.738,0.073

(renetti & spr :/ )

but to see it nerf? unlikely, probably because the gun itself is already nerfed due to the magazine size to begin with, however, even if it was to get a nerf on either the ttk or the amount of time to kill someone, iw has to make another 40 round attachment for the as val due to the damage drop off.

so in a sense, the gun is already stable the way it is. 

i've realize that each mw weapons has it's pro's and cons while i was getting damascus.

no it�s not. this is a casual shooter with a super low skill gap. �competitive� cod is just normal pubs with a banlist. there�s nothing competitive about it. plus this game�s ttk is shoot first die first. it doesn�t even reward actual aiming which is probably the one thing in this game that requires skill.

899,"i'm pretty sure it's not on purpose. if they wanted to intentionally slow the player down when switching from sticks to a gun, then they would have just made the animation slower, so the ads would still happen but it would just take a bit longer to come up.

this is a clear order-of-input glitch � it might make sense for them to purposely make it so if you accidentally hit ads *before* weapon switch then it just ignores the weapon switch, as it's already accepted the input for the melee. but what's happening here is it accepts the input for the weapon switch, then instead of queuing the ads input, the ads input breaks the action it's already accepted and started.

personal example: i�d guess that my team wins 80% of cheshire park dom matches if we start on the a side.",0.9492,0.022,0.817,0.161
936,"if you can spawn a side on a dom match on crash, you're going to win, super easily.  
  
that back alley from c spawn down to a spawn is easy to make into a choke point if you're quick enough when you spawn at a.

939,"arklov - minor a advantage as its quicker to b, and easier to defend a and b simulatniously. 

azhir - minor a advantage as it's easier and safer to get back to b when defending b, kinda toss up though. 

euphrates - minor a advantage just because it's easier to get out of spawn if you're being trapped. c is easier to get trapped on. 

granza - a side is very strong. you you simultaneously defend a and b, as well as spawns are very close to b. c spawns are horrible and you have no way to defend b from c. 

gun runner - easier to attack b from a, but it's easier to get spawn trapped on a. kinda toss up.

hackney - a side strong, quicker to b, and c side is much easier to spawn trap. 

piccadilly - c side very strong. quick to b off spawn as well as very safe with lots of routes and cover. a side is a slaughterhouse and insanely easy to get trapped on by a semi competent team. 

ramaza - c side strong, very quick to b, and a is easier to get trapped on. both sides are good at defending b once you have it though, c a little more though. 

shoothouse - c side very strong. i never cap a, straight to c. c controls office and junkyard, so easy to trap a.

petrograd - c side slight advantage, quick to b and defends b pretty easily.

crash - a side strong, quick to b, you can hold back alley, as well as burger joint, without over extending. really easy to trap c.

shipment - i like c, but it really doesnt matter. 

vacant - c side very strong. quick to b, protected from killstreaks, and really easy to defend b. a sucks pretty bad.

atlas - no huge adavantage either way, i prefer a as you can defend b a bit easier. 

khandor - a has a slight advantage due to spawns, but you can get trapped on either a or c.

rust - a side is strong because is stupid easy to trap them on c when you have a/b

aniyha - no real advantage either way, personal preference really.

hardhat - a has a minor advantage because it's easier to defend b, but this ones pretty balanced.

hovec - a side very strong. c side has you fighting uphill the whole game. the only befit of c is its quick to b but not worth it.

backlot - no major advantage either way, i like c though because holding taxi gets you alot of kills when they come from a.

cheshire - no major advantage, but i like c just so your teammates dont camp the 2nd floor marked building.

scrapyard - one of the few maps you can win by holding a and c and letting enemies hold b. no real advantage to a or c though.  

petrov - its a cluster fuck of a map, but personal preference is a. 

suldal - a side strong side. you can defend b easily from a, and it's very quick to b compared to c. back spawns at c feel like granza, so far from b. 

broadcast - c side very strong. protected from kill streaks, and you're quick to b. it's also stupid easy to trap people on a. 

tank factory - c side has a minor advantage, i think you spawn a hair closer, and it's easier to control the rooftops.",0.9981,0.154,0.567,0.28

listen to me very carefully.

after you read this comment, your grind will be made easier. do not expect anyone to help you here, except yourself and your ability to learn the intricacies of a beautiful weapon, for a skilled crossbow user is very deadly.

for bolt velocity, use 28 strand cable, tac laser, ads speed stock, ftac speed grip and sleight of hand. you can experiment with different attachments for so many of them affect the way the weapon handles and it�s just nice how you can make so many cool combinations, but still kill people if you�re a good shot. for example, i love running the 16 strand cable even though it decreases the velocity just because the blue wire looks sexy with a golden bow.

and you can be a good shot, you have the potential.

the one big hump with this gun is getting used to the arrow velocity. this ain�t no gun. it�s a weapon used to hunt werewolves. this leads to the player getting frustrated and turned off by the gun. however, you need to understand that this gun requires good anticipation of the enemy movement. so if you use throwing knives, learning this gun...or bow is much easier.

after tonight, do not call the crossbow trash again. once you get good with it, you�ll be having so much fun being able to confidently slap it on in public matches and fuck shit up haha. you can be that if you change your perspective of this gun being trash. it�s very good, fun, spices the game up by bringing a new challenge, and i just haven�t been able to put it down since i got it gold, now i�m going for obsidian.

so go on op, get out and get that gold. i know you can do it.

oh one last thing, sensitivity. you may wanna decrease it to increase your tracking, but you may have to find your sweet spot. personally, i play on 17h/13v sensitivity with a controller dead zone of .4 because i love doing dirty flicks on people haha.

i would totally play with you but i have work in 5 hours, but we can play after i�m off if you�re down.

1-b: it's not totally unheard of for groups like uksf and the cia to work together. they're part of nato, and since we later find out price has specific experience and knowledge of the stolen gas, laswell reached out to him for his capability and expertise. he probably would still have to clear going after all that with his superiors, but after the picadilly attacks and the links between the gas and al-qatala and the attacks proper, the sas probably has a vested interest in finding the bastards, so price and gaz join up with the cia as part of a joint-op.  


2: not impossible, tbh. gaz is also sas, but is attached to the met as a counterterrorism operator. the sas isn't that big as well, likely what happened was price asked his superior to fold gaz back in with his own unit, since gaz states he's had intel on the aq cell that blows up picadilly circus ""for weeks"".  


3. if the nato strike team was doing a false flag (like we're led to believe they did), it would likely be an apc with no identifying marks that's used by many other countries or can otherwise be easily obtained. worst case, cleanup crews are sent in afterwards to get rid of any non-urzikstani bodies and materiel. in fact, nearly every piece of equipment would either have to have been scrubbed for possible origin tracing or not used things that can be pointed right to the us (a mere c-130 isn't exclusively a us plane, after all, etc.). more than likely the op would have required the oks from the head of every unit involved in the op, and given the sas's shadowy ops record, it should be no shock they'd back something like this if it involved destroying a rogue russian general's chemweapon (they've literally invaded prisons for less).",-0.9169,0.103,0.817,0.081

the game doesn't have an infinite amount of players to cater to. the player count is finite (albeit larger than most online games due to crossplay). but people still gravitate toward a limited number of playlists. adding more and more just ends up bloating the game. there is a thing called ""having too many choices"". it's bad enough that people already have different quick play filter preferences. adding more choices would only result in certain modes never having enough players, which would result in worse connections for low population regions, or even no games at all.

case in point, cold war has a fuckton of playlists right now, and it's bloated as hell. searching for modes like combined arms and fireteam can take forever, and in regions like asia, you end up being put in a >200ms server. it also doesn't help that fireteam is put in the bottom of the menu, so it gets even less attention.",-0.9653,0.145,0.777,0.078
1358,"yeah but wouldn�t plethora of playlists bring even more players to the game who wouldn�t play the game because they don�t have a large variety of playlists? look at older or even recent battlefield games. still have a ton of players. the pc cod4 which is a old ass game has a battlefield type of filtering system(it�s a plug-in ) , where you can select dozens of game modes and that game is still maxing out the 32-48 player lobbies. now imagine if mw had the same thing as cod4, with the current players base.

in terms of cw, i think the problem is that the game is just really bad, and this is coming from someone who is usually optimistic about cod games. ( i loved ghosts, ww2 and aw). the only thing saving it is cross platform.",-0.8515,0.132,0.783,0.085
1359,"1. the engine has a limit to how many playlists there can be at once. (could be a memory limit)
2. not everyone likes mindless game modes and it makes it much harder for smaller regions to find games in other modes.
3. maybe you should play the other modes and get better at them rather than complaining because it hurts your ego and you can't get instant gratification.
4. playlists are very likely automated at this point.",-0.1803,0.109,0.801,0.089
1360,"1. doubt.  wasn�t there a huge array of playlists earlier in 2020? i remember you had shipment and shoot house split, then you had a bunch of 10v10 playlists. you had those mosh pits as well and the drop zone, all at the same time.

2. it�s not mindless, it just more fun and actually takes skill because you must attack the objectives and are actually forced to rotate. the 4v4 moshpit was crazy fast paced and objective based, not one game goes to the time limit.

3. it�s not about performance, but rather enjoyment. i play just as good and actually have higher stats on these slow hide and seek games modes, because you just die less often. the problem is that games are supposed to excite you and get you all hyped and not make you feel like you want to take a nap.

usually i keep the shield as my primary but will swap if i�m facing multiple opponents at the same time and can�t get around them or the distance is too great.  i have faced people try to go 3 against me, which is fine, so long as my team is able to flank them in response.  i may be sacrificed, but in the long run 3-4 of the other team went down with me.  while other times i have dominated with the shield, but nothing crazy, no 60 plus kills in a single game.

it can be a crazy powerful weapon in the right hands, but has some serious weaknesses which make it the most balanced weapon in the game.  yes, thermite and semtex can take a shield user out, but i�m rushing you when that happens because i�m going to take you down with me if possible.  i�m not always successful, but i love the reactions when i am.

a good shield player can be a strong support player for the team (emphasis on good) and turn the tide of the game.  however if all you�re doing is running it on your back, then i�m targeting you with everything i�ve got (restock with thermite and flash bangs for example).",0.9235,0.094,0.777,0.13

1641,"so here's where we need to have a bit of an understanding regarding the zombies aether story's ending, and a general concept of multiverse-related stories and how they work:

first, the aether story ended by having the original aether multiverse collapse, and a new universe is created in its place. this universe is implied to be the mw2019/bocw one where every story is intertwined (campaign + mp + warzone + zombies). this, in a way, allows cod to start fresh and lay the ground works for an interconnected universe.

second, stories involving multiverses have always had a form of ""selective reboot"" where past stories may be retconned to fit the new narrative. it does not mean the old story isn't relevant anymore, it just exists in its own bubble. like the plot of avengers endgame, time travel doesn't mean you change history. you just create new timelines where history diverges, while your main one keeps on going (or ends, depending on how you feel about it).

so in a way, this could be where cod is headed. the black ops series from 1 to 4, and the original mw trilogy, as well as every other one-time cod titles, are in their own respective bubbles. whereas the new rebooted universe will take certain aspects from bo1, maybe bo2 (like woods escaping vietnam in 1972), plus mw2019, and work from there to craft a new story. hence why kravchenko is now researching zombies. hence why the menendez cartel witnessed a zombie outbreak on their facility. this does not invalidate bo2 in any way, bo2 simply exists in a separate bubble now.",0.9432,0.012,0.899,0.089

i personally switched between using the holger and the finn to unlock it. i ran a holger with 30rnd mags and a thermal, as well as no stock and a tac laser so i could ads as quick as possible. this works well for tossing the smoke far away and shooting anyone who passes through. i ran a finn with a chainsaw setup whenever i got a map like shoothouse since i could hip fire spray in close quarters and still be accurate.

you have to be in the smoke, not the enemy. so you can just mount that center wall, toss a smoke at your feet, and hope to get a couple kills with a thermal scope before the smoke clears (or before an enemy with a thermal picks you off haha)

so in general the same applies to any map that tends to be good for grinding longshots � hardhat, khandor, euphrates, grazna, azhir, etc. 

hardhat, khandor, and azhir are all especially good for grinding longshots if you play free-for-all and camp the right spots.

1743,"the first thing is response time which is basically a delay. 

1ms ... is arguably a non-existent delay. 

even a crappy lcd with a 15ms delay, your gonna have a relatively hard time feeling the difference. 

arguably the most noticeable difference is seeing more, and what i mean by this is when you�ve got yourself a 24-27� inch monitor, your don�t have to move your head/neck nearly as much to see all of the screen. 

when your sitting on a couch looking at 65� tv. small details like a guy peaking a window 100m away in the top right of your screen are pretty easy to miss, especially when your tunnel visioned on the center screen. 

but these small details like the guy peaking  are much more noticeable when your nice and close to a small monitor. 

and lastly, pixel density.

at 1080p, their are only 1920 x 1080 pixels. so when you look at, let�s say a 55� tv... the pixel per square inch is about 40. while the pixel density of a 24� monitor is about 91. 

the tv won�t look terrible, because your sitting 6ft away from it, but if you say let�s say 3 ft from both the tv and monitor, the tv would look absolutely terrible. 

sitting closer to a higher cluster of pixels make those fine details (like the guy peaking a window 100m example) much more detailed.",-0.3506,0.089,0.837,0.074

mw's animation team went above and beyond, say what you want about the gameplay but the animations across the board make mw a technical marvel and it shows just how much care was put into the guns in that game. cw's don't even compete with bo1 from 10 years ago, idk who 3arch have in their animation department but they need to either be re-trained or let go. or they just need to find animators who have the passion the mw team has.

but some things to watch out for that tend to be clear signs:

1. tracking targets through walls: on the kill cam,if they are staring at a wall and perfectly tracking you until you can be hit consistently. tends to be obvious.

2. they don�t play aggressively: the will likely always be keeping something between you and them by some magnitude. since they can see where you are, there is no need to rush or be aggressive, as it removes their advantage.

3. the use weapons that aren�t suited to the job:
using a sniper rifle in a enclosed, indoor space with tight corners is suicide. since the ads, and fire rate is suicidal...unless you know where people are ahead of time.

4. you never kill them head on:
note the ways they get killed. most cases those people will always win head on engagements, but wall hacks are line of sight. if you only manage to kill them from behind or the side, but never head to head...kinda sus.

5. they use weapons that attract attention:
getting shot through a wall with a sniper rifle, lmg, or the as val? no one would bat an eye since the normally excell at penetration. but note the attachments. note how the builds don�t make a lot of sense for the play style.

6.  follow behind a teammate at about 6-12 feet, and slightly off to one side.  but when going into buildings let the freind go first when the friendly gets killed, note the kill came. if they track the both of you, and behave as if their waiting for you. that�s another tell.

if you want an arcady, a little bit slower paced shooter game, go with cold war. now if you want a realistic, fast paced chaotic modern military shooter, go with mw. i like mw�s graphics better and think that the movement is smoother (slide cancelling, tactical sprint) and i just like that fast pacing and chaos more. 

but it�s still only my opinion, you can buy cw if you want, but i personally prefer modern warfare.

and since you�re asking on both subs i think you�ll get cw is better in cw sub and mw is better here. but anyways, that�s my opinion. hope it helps.

the reason people do it is cause they want more updates for this game, and i guess they're hoping a developer sees the demand for it? i don't know, but this has been the first cod that has had some sort of cross progression, so it gives the impression that mw isn't being abandoned, even though it is, and people don't want it to be.

personally i never believed any of the stuff about season 7, cause i know how cod games roll. it's really fucking sad though that cod is still doing yearly games. it could really benefit from releasing games every 2 or 3 years, having more time to work on them, and giving the current game more content. it just makes for a better quality product.",0.9413,0.041,0.815,0.143

2696,"if you think modern warfare is bad in this regard, you should try cold war.

everything about these two games were designed with controllers/bad players in mind. the aim assist is stronger than ever, the maps are very porous with sometimes as many as 5 lines of sight and camping spots, the lag comp doesn't have a ping limit and favors the shooter no matter how terrible the network connection is. cold war even adds visual recoil and visual flinch which, in practice, really only nerfs kbm users.

kbm still has an overall advantage (for skilled players), but there will be a *lot* of moments where you'll get lasered by the aim assist or feel like console players have walls due to how strongly the lag comp gives them a handicap. and if you run into xim/cm players? well, that's a legal cheat in the cod universe, get used to it.

ultimately, the blunting of the skill ceiling in cod has been a gradual process, but mw and cold war are definitely giant and blatant leaps in making bad players happy. it has been great for business and unfortunately it's here to stay for the franchise. we'll get downvoted for spelling out the truth because as you could probably guess, the majority of players are not great and thus, benefit from these new game design choices.

bigger picture is worse - this is endgame for all competitive multiplayer games since most game studios goals are to maximize profits. my advice is to support indie studios who still care about competitive integrity (they're quite few in number) or just stick to older games as try to keep them alive as much as possible.",0.98,0.112,0.698,0.19

i don't know if you played world at war when cod was initially designed for pc you could see the much better map designed with wide open spaces and not too many places for camping. really love that game and still very occasionally play it with old friends. it feels like the map design of battlefield. i'd the new cod can take design clues of battlefield 3 and 4 tdm maps it would be awesome. really love bf4, still play it every week.

speaking of indie developers, i actually play quite a lot of them including dusk, squad, insurgency sandstorm. but do you know about the game world war 3? the game was incredible. it's supposed to be a game like battlefield with cod like killstreaks. sadly due to almost know advertisement the game died. still waiting for news on that game. but you should check it out.",-0.1771,0.126,0.721,0.152

in objective modes the spawns are fairly predictable. in something like hardpoint the guys defending the hardpoint already know what direction you're coming from, so being on uav doesn't actually matter. 

plus they can be shot down very easily, you can destroy a uav within 5 seconds if you're outdoors when it's called in 

i'd say it's only a must have in one life modes, where sneaking around is a big part of the game. especially cyber attack, where the bomb carrier has a permanent uav if they use it. 

high alert is a better perk imo. pointman and hard-line are good if getting killstreaks fast is a part of your playstyle. restock i've never been much of a fan of, 25 seconds can be quite a long time in fast paced modes. overkill is disgusting on headquarters, use an ar to get to the hq then a shotgun to defend.

the multiplayer is just plain fun, the customization is awesome and every gun feels viable to an extent, warzone with the boys is giving me memories of playing pubg back in 2017 during the height of its popularity. warzone is definitely a better br experience than pubg is now, and i can see myself playing it for some time.

and as cold war came out while i was just diving in to mw2019, naturally i was curious since the last cod i played prior to this was mw3. looking at gameplay, cold war just looks blander, stiffer, and less polished. the reload animations are just plain bad for the most part, the way the camera falls to the ground when you die detached from your body just looks like an early access game's death camera, the font they use for getting kills and objectives looks like it came from fortnite, and the sound effects are just bad.

i�ve grown and got out the cod cycle long ago. i don�t mind a game here and there on it, but cod, like life when years pass on, simply aren�t the same anymore. i and maybe about 70% of the people that bought cod mw�19 probably bought the game mainly for the title and the fan service that it delivered. was it successful in that? yes.. can it be fun? yes.. will i say that it is a game for me and see myself playing on a consistent daily-ish basis? prob not, but i can see why the game is appealing to people. the last cod game that was pretty much when it was still in its greatest days were bo2. no doubt that was a time in which you can easily have all your friends on and run party modes, custom games, etc... nowadays, it�s a struggle to get people to play the same game as you as people have grown and standards changed, for the better or worse. even w the success of mw�19, the higher ups wanting their pockets filled, say it with me, do not care, how you feel about the any of the games as they know you will be playing or buying them anyway, whether you invested any kind of time or money into the games, you are doing them the favor. 

besides, half the people speaking poorly of cw don�t understand or take into consideration the circumstances each of the games went through during their phase in being made. one was before lockdown effects to place while the other was during it. the style of each of the devs of infinity ward & treyarch are much different as well. i don�t wanna go to the whole spiel of things because not only is it long, but ppl will prob just call me a fanboy of the game when in all honesty, i�m looking at things from all perspectives & don�t care that much of cod as one would if this was 2009 or 2010 with mw2 or bo1. & also knowing people of reddit within this channel, speaking of something not being as well as they think it is in mw is subject to downvoting and crucification because they think mw is the best thing to ever happen, which is fine. when half of the ppl are blindly following like sheep and are quick to defend the game without being able to hear a different opinion of it than �mw is good at...�, all hell breaks loose. 

mw is indeed a quality made game, but that doesn�t go without mentioning its faults. perfect example is the gunsmith customization.. devs did a fair amount of research on current, older, and possible future weapon. but near half of the components of the weapons are missing something towards their real life counterparts or use ones inspired by different weapons that aren�t necessarily the weapons or parts people think they are.

tl;dr the posts of you speaking your mind and opinion is fine. you are entitled to it. to see posts on the mw sub be filled with 60%+ of the titles being �mw good, cw bad� is getting old and i miss the days of ppl showing unique or funny clips of showing what goes on during their play of mw. these posts of shitting on cw just because ppl like mw more for what it�s worth. are not only getting dragged out, but also are not original as they think. you and plenty of other people have said probably the exact same thing and regardless of how you care of the game or games, the jerk off higher ups got either your time played and/or money spent on the title(s). you can say �well if we keep mentioning it, they�ll eventually have to change it, right?�... let me counter that by asking you how fixing sbmm is going... people have been talking about it for the longest yet none of the devs or activision has yet to make a comment on it, especially on these most recent cods",0.9983,0.07,0.757,0.173

if you have all necessary details like original activision id, email etc, give that info too. and if you have screenshots of in game purchases etc, ask the support agent for an in chat link so you can upload it and have it attached to your case. 

after about a week of waiting, i got an email saying �request could not be processed�... i was confused and upset so decided to chat with support again. luckily this time the support agent was actually really nice and helpful. he walked me through the process of submitting the request again correctly. mind you this was on march 5th. after this chat session, i got my account back on march 9th. 

all hope isn�t lost. just try to follow those steps. if all else fails, file a complaint with the better business bureau. i�ve seen some people get their accounts back that way too. and just as the other comment said, if the hacker takes liberties on your account and does dumb shit, there�s a chance your account will get permanently banned shortly after you get it back. but do mention this to a support agent in chat as i did, i told them if this were to happen, will the security enforcement department look into it and reserve the ban, i was told yes and i took a screenshot of that conversation.

just keep playing and trying new load outs and game modes that suit your play style. i mostly play capture the flag and demolition also because the spawns in these game modes and the game play is usually slower which suits my play style.

learn the maps 

use your mini map to identify where the action is.

try to find cover when you anticipate a gun fight is going to happen.

keep your centering dot in areas where you think enemies will appear.

3608,"lots of questions! i'll address a few as best as i can. first, think about playing more objective based games like domination or hard point. when you get in a game where your team is playing together you can get used to ""running and gunning"" a bit more. even though you can camp semi-successfully on some maps, as you saw ppl will come clean you out of your spot. plus, camping gets boring, well unless your hitting ridiculous snipes, lol

1) lots of factors in speed of shooting an enemy, but i'll tell you a couple you can easily improve. many players use the same weapons. in mw and warzone and cold war there are ""meta"" weapons. basically, you can search online and folks out there test new or updated guns and get their stats. they then breakdown the best in each class, with the best attachments. so, it's optimal to stay current on this info and level a couple of the fastest ttk(time to kill)guns up and use them in your load out. you might think about using smgs, bc you can aim down the sights faster on these weapons.  

i was gonna answer all the questions, but after writing all this i looked back at the sub and several posts say what i was gonna say, lol. i will expand on something one of the replies mentioned which i think will help you, though. go on youtube and look up mw or warzone movement techniques. you learn things like slide-canceling or jumping around corners to throw off your enemy's aim. you're gonna be up against players who have played shooters for years and 12 year olds with like twice your reaction time(no offense) so in a 1v1 gunfight with them, say you're both standing in the street, using the same gun and see each other at the same time and just stand there and fire---they're gonna win. you gotta learn movement techniques to give you an advantage. to do this on controller, it helps to change your button layout to suit you and make some of those movements easier. i recommend using the ""tactical"" setting, which puts melee on b and your slide on r analog. this way, you can slide around a corner with your right thumb still on the stick so you can keep aiming on the enemy! there are tons of different controller types and i suggest finding one that allows you to slide and jump while still aiming. it helps a lot. especially if you're gonna play warzone. and as far as warzone, just play that tutorial they've got a few times. then when you play for real, choose duos or trios and see if you can find a gamer or two that has comms that'll help you understand the pace and tactics. bc battle royale games like warzone are entirely different animals than small maps. good luck!",0.9967,0.065,0.751,0.185

2) you cannot buy anything useful, even if you buy a blueprint you can't customize it if you haven't unlocked it, blueprints are just for looks, you should just be doing the challenges for unlocking the guns, you can find those challenges by going over the guns in the selection menu. since you like the oden, i definitely recommend unlocking the cr 56 amax, also try using the uzi with the 41.ae rounds that require a challenge to unlock too.

1. this is just something you have to get better at.

2. operators have no effect on gameplay, they have their unique looks, their own lines and quips and their own finishers but nothing more than that.

i got some great tips here. i've tried some, and may take others up on some offers for lessons.

i learned how to slide cancel, and adjusted my settings. i ended up switching to specialist mode. i start with cold amped, scavenger and extra piece of lethal. then i unlock lethal regeneration, ghost, and battle hardened.

played rust and camped on the high tower. i was dropping a proximity mine every 25 seconds, and otherwise sniping with my oden. got about 16 kills and 3 deaths.

then played shoothouse. camped in the second story hallway behind b.  i had enough proximity mines to leave two at both entrances, and otherwise sniped out the window and sometimes popped out the door to fire my bazooka. i got **thirteen** kills without a single death. i realize that's not a big deal compared to what you guys are used to, but i've never done that in my career. at some point after i think the tenth kill, i unlocked scavenger which basically gives you every perk. one guy i killed at least five times because he kept coming back. he'd either die on my proximity mines or i'd shoot him trying to peek through the door.

i've called cluster strikes on top of entire squads hiding behind a single rock and not even get a hitmarker. once i tossed a flashbang at the last remaining team who was also behind a rock. it exploded within 5 feet of them with a clear line of sight and didn't touch any of them. i promptly got lasered because i was already moving towards them, assuming my flash bang would actually hit them and it didn't. my squad once got lit up by 4 different squads when we were on top of a police station, and 3 of those squads were on the ground in the middle of the open and they could clearly see each other, much better than they could see us.

skill based matchmaking actually helped the game.  i say this because you have so many toxic people who say things like get good when others are genuinely trying to improve.  in reality, those types of players are sloppy and can�t actually play well, they just know how to exploit the game flaws (like spawn traps and broken weapons).  skill based matchmaking gives the opportunity for people to actually improve and develop skill rather than leave and not play the game.

i have experienced not systems, and left after mw3 because i was tired of being a clay pigeon every game.  after playing the current modern warfare, i am a lot better because i had a fighting chance and developed my playing abilities.  yes, some games are tough as nails, but i don�t have to experience 30 deaths and 6 kills every single game.

with that said, skill based matchmaking actually saved the franchise, because more players can actually have fun.  yes there are those who complain because they can�t steamroll everyone else and they suddenly face actual competition.  however, if the old system remained, more would have left and never returned.",0.8573,0.095,0.77,0.135

1 is that you think sales is proportional to popularity. the majority of sales for cold war would have happened very early on, before anyone realized how much the game sucked. game sales could right now look amazing on paper but in reality the game could be barely populated.

2 is that you mentioned this subreddit�s proportionally low traffic compared to cold war�s despite that that game is actively getting supported right now and modern warfare hasn�t been supported for months. that considered, cold war�s subreddit user traffic looks even worse. it stands perfectly well to reason that this sub would be experiencing less traffic now.

3938,"i've definitely completed that one a while ago, and it was rough. pkm is advisable due to dps and per mag, i'd use fmj for the armour, snatch grip, muzzle brake, blue dot holo or reflex, tac laser

riot shield can stop all damage from suicide bombers head on, more reliable if you crouch, plus protects you if you get overwhelmed or need to defuse the bomb in the crate stages

thermite is a great lethal - enemies that walk though where it sticks tend to die, maybe use stims or stuns to rush defuse from cover or revive a teammate.

i don't know if you could cheese this one, but armoured enemies in regular dif still get 2 shot meleed like unarmoured enemies. sometimes in co-op i run an uzi with the shortest barrel (8.5''), no stock, breacher device, fast melee perk and 5mw laser. it moves real fast, one shot melees anything that isn't a jug/other kill streak, and the recoil is pretty easy to control as the kick and fire rate is low + all recoil increases from attachments are vertical

from memory, when an enemy is shot it will get a yellow skull over its head; it will change colour depending on how many people have shot it. this indicates the multiplier on damage dealt to that enemy. try and tag enemies so that your teammates can finish them easier, and shoot enemies your teammates have shot/are shooting.

hiding inside in the pool house and using chopper gunners makes the first defending till 'exfil' pretty easy

for dead silence i don't have an opinion but i absolutely love the added movespeed you get from the field upgrade when active. so if the alternative is to have it as an always must have perk for run and gun, i'd rather have it as a field upgrade and bring something else.

i want them to keep shoot house in the next cod or make more maps in a similar style. to me its probably the best map design you can want in a cod. every weapon type is viable and what changes the playstyle is just the routes you take in between the lanes to shorten the encounter range. i think its a lovely way to make snipers as usable as shotguns in the same map by just having clever lane traversal.

yup sad to say it but that�s the thing now bro. after cw was integrated into warzone, you can�t find packs through the armory anymore.  

and yup, i own mw multiplayer as well. but still, even if you only own warzone, you should still be able to buy packs from the armory. 

but as i said before, that�s the thing now bro. back then, you can still buy operator packs through the armory even if you missed it from the store, or when it hadn�t rotated again into the store yet. the only packs that are available through the armory now are only the certain weapon packs and a few not-so-good-looking operator packs.

you should probably wait for the operator pack that you want and grab it from the store when it appears again. as for me, this ghost pack appeared a few weeks before i posted this question but i didn�t bother to buy it before. then when it appeared again, i immediately bought it. 

but don�t worry bro, the older packs should still be available for you once they rotate again. just be sure to check the store everyday since they don�t give you the new items indicator dot on the store tab anymore.

i guess a lot of the toxic players moved on to cw. 

sure in an ideal world i would love more seasons/beattle pass, a mapfilter and new content overall.

the fire-rate also lets you kill people who get the jump on you first a lot of the time, which is aided by the low-recoil letting you beam people in the head.

and i never used personal radar until i did my launchers. now i always have it. i didn�t use specialist at all with this grind even though i probably should have, just so i could get some personal radars up for launcher grinders. i didn�t get a 4th kill in this video but if i had, you�d see it�s a cuav. and the third streak is a vtol, all for launcher folks.

5612,"the game can randomly stutter without any fps drops or logical reasons, and it does this often. for me it stutters like half the time i boot up the game, and you can instantly tell if the problem is there in a couple mins of playing.

for the fix go to nvidia control panel, global 3d settings, and turn off the shader cache. then apply and restart your pc for it to take effect (at least i read you need to do it, so i've always rebooted and it has worked). then go back to nvcp and enable the shader cache and restart your system again. now the game should work flawlessly.

another thing which has helped ppl to fix stuttering (including me, in the past) is going to file explorer and follow this path: (c:\users\your user name\documents\call of duty modern warfare), and inside the mw folder there is another folder called ""players"". just delete the players folder, it won't reset your ingame settings or anything and it will be rebuilt once you boot up mw.

doing both of the steps i mentioned always fixes it for me, but i haven't figured out what causes the problem. this problem started happening with some of the big updates mw had around cw's release.

also my system specs (so you know it's not my hw causing the problems):

strix 2080ti oc

10900k

16bg 3200mhz cl14 ram

970evo plus ssd

1080p 240hz monitor with g-sync module
(btw i'm playing mw with g-sync and v-sync enabled, @200hz so fps also caps at 200, for the maximum frametime/fps consistency, which makes the picture so smooth even the smallest stutter is visible)

1. you gotta know the map well, i mean: really well, know your flanking points, covers and safe covers also (places where you can point and shoot without being a sitting duck for some sniper
2. try to use a combo of sniper and a good  ar with nice medium range both with silencer
3. always check the map when spawning to see how the battle is going, move with your team, don't be a rambo unless the other team is playing really bad and not covering each other
4. stay focus on the area you want to take advantage of, or well,the area where the flag is: are there enemies?, is the area clean?, if not clean: begin cleansing one enemy at a time
5. always check your mates position, that is of the most importance for having situational awareness
6. always pay atention to sounds, specially the automatic call outs made by your team mates, they always alert you when engaging an enemy
7. dont rush anything unless you know exactly where the enemy is (for example, you see a flag is filled with your teammates and no enemy is close)
8. only make mini rushes when moving to one cover to another, but if there is a corner and you haven't explored well or spot enemies and there is close shooting towards your position, is almost for sure you will get killed and have that nasty feeling of ""i spawn i die every time"". that is a tactical mistake and can and should be avoided unless you love to be frustrated all the time

now, i haven't done any trials since season six of mw, but i was quite disappointed to see that, for one, i couldn't even use a 2xp token unless i switched to bocw, activate the token, and then switch back to utilize it. secondly, it didn't even grant the double xp.

why do i think it is the way it is? well, if it isn't on purpose, then it's to drive people to want to play the bocws trials to give them the adequate 2xp (untested), which in turn would help drive sales of that game up. all i'm saying is, i love this game, and it saddens me that activision wants to simply make their customers forget about it.",0.9477,0.069,0.773,0.158

tdm and all the objective based modes are definitely harder to learn now, because of the aforementioned strategy lock-in with a lot of players. what i'll say is that weapon choice matters so much, lmgs are exceedingly rare in mp because the ads time is glacial and vs players with fast smg builds you're going to die absolutely every single time unless you spend the round on your belly in a corner. loadout building is something of an art but the general rule i use is the higher i can get the mobility (aka ads time) and control ratings, the better off i am.",0.3469,0.07,0.838,0.092

i didn�t play mw for 2-3 months, and when some friends invited me to get back on, everything was gone. i had multiple guns gold, lots of guns max level, lots of blueprints, character skins, sprays, and other items. some were even paid for. i used to play this game a lot so i had lots of stuff unlocked. 

after waiting ~10 days for my account to be recovered to another email, i log in and there is still nothing. the only thing that changed was the activision account name. this is bullshit, i spent days of my time grinding to unlock this stuff and now it�s just gone? 

also, the activision website is beyond terrible. using it in chrome is fully impossible. when i click the log in or sign up buttons at the top right corner, it just opens a new tab of the same exact site. there is quite literally no way to login on their website unless you use microsoft edge.

also, i can not get in contact with support. that screen with the �loading agent chat� message has been like that for about 20 minutes now. last time, it instantly switched to a page showing me how many people were ahead of me in the queue(150!!!!). even then, it took me literal hours of waiting until i finally was able to talk to a real human.

6012,"this is my take: these were part of a planned season 7, that would�ve gotten released if cold war launch and/or season 1 launch got delayed. season 7 was a backup plan. they got some of the work done for that season (these 2 guns, without multiplayer or warzone balancing done), while other parts were abandoned (new map, mid-season gun/melee weapon releases, etc) when it was looking more and more likely that treyarch and raven were going to meet their deadlines. 

these 2 guns are basically abandonware at this point.  iw has no reason to do additional work on these to finish them, as they�re already working on their next game, and raven�s roadmap is already filled with cold war content. 

edit: alternatively, season 7 could�ve been part of the original roadmap, but because the previous season launches were always pushed out by at least a week or 2 due to delays, season 7 was pushed out too far to be fully completed before it bumped against the cold war schedule.

the sa-87 and the holger are not amazing, but at least they're closed bolt and fire instantly.

6057,"i run lmgs almost exclusively, m91 for sure.

sa87 is a reliable 3-shot, since the buff it can also 3-shot limbs. it's much better than people think. slow rof but a very forgiving reload if you're used to lmgs.

mg34 trades everything for ttk. reload is painful. it has the most weighted attachments when considering ads times, so if you build it slow, it's really slow, but if you throw a short barrel and no stock on it it's not bad at close range. it's not a fantastic gun but i've put a lot of time into it and i think it has a place if you like playing with friends. you have to run the 100 round, and i even run 100 round + fast hands on one of my blueprints.

pkm is good. not much to say, it kills nearly as fast the mg34 and it has faster ads, better reload. snatch grip is great, but it's worth noting that commando foregrip is so good for long-range that i run them interchangeably (snatch is the go-to for regular 6v6 though).

m91 does not get limb 3-hits, fires slower than anything but the sa87 (not counting base finn, i would have to double check though), has recoil that is vertical but not insignificant, and has the stand-out feature of having the longest 3-hit chest range. that's it. i don't think it's worth it at all.",0.9873,0.057,0.753,0.19

6059,"i'll add that if i were to rank them, i would put them in the order pkm, mg34, sa87, m91. i'd still take the mg34 over the sa87, but i think there is reasonable debate there. also i personally use the mg34 over the pkm because while the pkm is brilliant, i like the mg34. it's like the pkm with gigantic clown shoes.

if you were to include the dlcs, i would put the finn and the bruen right up at the top, and the holger would sit next to or just behind the sa87. it's fine, but it's not great at anything and it doesn't get a long barrel. big sad. (edit: on second thought i'd easily put the holger behind the sa87)

the m91 isn't absolute garbage, but part of the issue here is that a lot of the lmgs are really similar. without a feature that defines them they don't feel like a good option. plus, when the raal releases i fully expect it to be dominant based on the currently available stats. you're looking at a 2-shot body. the gorgon returns (please let this release thursday).",0.8674,0.058,0.831,0.111

and at this point in the game's life cycle, all of the content has already been released. for some people that's a negative, but for me it's a positive, since the game is filled to the brim with content currently and nothing is a timed exclusive anymore.

ddos attack, random guy knew your ip address, still a hack, but nothing crazy, actually pretty normal.

short answer: no.

long answer: no, but you never know, just keep your antivirus updated and don't do stupid shit on the internet.

first phone your isp (internet service provider), tell them what has happened and request a new ip address.

6512,"do note that you don't need to call your isp for a new ip. 

you can roll your ip by simply unplugging your router and modem for about 3-5 minutes. the isp's ip pool will recycle the old ip and rotate, which will assign you a new public ip. i will note that if you do this a bunch (say, 12 times in a month), you may retain the ip through a restart. 

if that doesn't happen, then your isp is using static ips. i cannot think of a single isp that does this as it's really stupid to do so.

another note, i would not advise taking the time to notify your isp or local police if you get ddosd. this is simply because it is nearly impossible for them to track said person, so it's more of a waste of time. on top of this, it's incredibly difficult to confirm the culprit (most ddosers use a vpn) and it's incredibly expensive to pursue legal action. the isp will just ignore your request unless you're a business.

 now, if you are getting harrassed over and over again by the same person, then you might want to look into blocking that person and a vpn. otherwise, it's a bit unecessary.",-0.9014,0.071,0.907,0.022

6795,"breathe through it friend  :)

shippyshooty is helpful for a lot of the dam grind, but not all of it.

when i was doing the grind and they took sts off the list i'd just switch to doing the parts of the grind that are best done outside of shoot house or shipment � eg, grinding launchers for vehicle/equipment takedowns is more efficient to do in free-for-all (core, specifically) as that's where people seem to pop the most personal radars. 

riot shield 3-kill streaks are more efficient to grind on rust than either shooty or shippy (at least it was for me). also, and this will sound counterintuitive, but i had good luck with riot shield threes when playing domination on grazna raid of all places. as long as your team is spawning on a-side you can camp in that room above b-flag, and when you see the indicator show that someone is taking b you just hop down out of the window, bonk 'em, then scurry back up to safety. 

longshots can be grinded just about as efficiently on hardhat, khandor, and euphrates bridge as they can on shoot house (although nothing is as efficient as shipment for shotgun longshots haha)

in general there was plenty for me to do while i was waiting for shippyshooty to come back around. 

i'll also add that it's *way better* to grind the launchers early instead of saving them for last. when you go into free-for-all, equip the launcher as a secondary but spend the bulk of your time slowly grinding whatever rifle/pistol/etc you're working on, and then switch to the launcher when you hear a killstreak getting called in. if you leave launchers for last then you basically just end up sitting on your thumb for most of any given match, waiting for enemies to call in prs. so much better to have something useful to work on while you're waiting for the prs to come � plus that way you have a bit less to grind once sts comes back  :)",0.9848,0.061,0.8,0.139

6981,"it's a grind, but you need to focus on knocking down every killstreak you see, in the air or on the ground.

* look up what counts for each launcher camo category, as their titles don't match what you get credit for... half the flying kill streaks count towards the 'ground vehicle' camo.
* you can use a luncher to melee shield turrets and sentry guns, and it counts towards your camo. often on shipment it's way easier to just bash a sentry gun to death, vs trying to get the jokr far enough away and at the right angle to destroy it.
* always have spotter equipped, unless you're on the 'amped kills' camo.
* be prepared to get killed a ton on shipment while you're looking up.
* i suggest having a class with a pkm as the weapon, then the strela or rpg as the secondary. every time a vtol goes up, nade yourself if you have to, then switch to that class. the pkm gets the vtol to the 'black smoke' stage very fast, then switch to your point-and-shoot launcher and finish the job. yes, you'll run into others on the grind who snake your kills, after you do the damage...
* for shipment i had the same class in three slots, but named 'rpg', 'strela', and 'jokr'. insta-rotate as needed, based on what kill streak just went up.
* anecdotally, i saw way more personal radars/uavs on shoot house, vs shipment, and you don't get insta-killed as often while you're trying to shoot stuff down.
* you *can* shoot down uav's with rpgs! you just need to visualize the straight line that the uav's traveling on, then lead it 4-5"" on screen. lead distance varies based on how far away the uav is, which means it's easier on smaller maps, as they appear closer. also, crouching seems to straighten out the rpg's shots?
* i never had luck shooting down uav's with the strela. not saying it can't be done, but i never got a single one in like 30 tries. maybe i just suck at it!",-0.993,0.158,0.786,0.057
6982,"here�s another one just on how to approach the camos that worked for me. while shoot the ship was in rotation, i did all of the camos for each launcher that required me to actually kill people. i knew i needed the madness of shipment and the familiarity with shoothouse to get these kills. i played core because i died too fast trying to get shots off in hc. these were my rules:

1. until jokr was done, i played with this class whenever i had an objective based mode for attacker and defender. on shipment, spam jokr rockets at objectives. you finish these camos very fast when you do this as objectives constantly switch possession in shipment and you�ll get attacker or defender based on who possesses the objective. you die a lot before you get a shot off many times, so any opportunity you have to get both rockets off before you die is pure gold. 
2. second priority was strela because it�s very frustrating with a small blast radius for killing people. i prefer to finish the most annoying first. 
3. pila was third priority. i played with this for kills after finishing the other two. (i had rpg kills done when i started actually focusing on launchers)
4. i used only the amped perk until kills were done then switched to spotter. i started to run specialist with hardline and amped equipped from the start, and spotter in my first extra perk slot (only takes one kill to get with hardline)
5. i obviously still focused on kill streaks in non-objective modes, while on this launcher kill mini-grind. 

once all kills were complete, i focused on kill streaks only. this is much much more chill. the order i did this in for my personal preference was jokr, strela, rpg, pila. i�m on my last few camos for the pila and it is a relaxed, mindless grind with streaks. this also allows you to play other maps and modes as you prefer since killstreaks are always there.",-0.9964,0.206,0.734,0.061

you can just run around melee killing people (plus if you target the far corner with a rocket you'll usually get a kill or two).

in fact i'd suggest getting all the jokr enemy-related challenges done this morning while shipment is still accessible without having to back out of 25 matches to find it, and then switching to the other launchers and doing the anti-personnel challenges in those ones too. (including the attacker/defender camos.)

once all your anti-personnel challenges are done, switch back to the jokr and head into core -> free-for-all to look for personal radars.

from what i've observed people tend to use pr in free-for-all more than any other mode (since you don't have any teammates who'd benefit from a uav).

and they tend to use it more in core-ffa than hardcore-ffa.

it's best not to leave the launchers for last, so you can spend your time maining a rifle or pistol and then just switch to the launcher when someone pops up a killstreak. 

having left launchers to last, you'll spend a lot of time just getting frustrated that no one is popping up prs.

but just stick with it. when you find a lobby where someone is using pr, remember what part of the map you saw them and sprint back to it after they kill you. keep feeding them kills, then as soon as the pop up a pr, kill them and start their killstreak cycle over again.

edit: also wanted to add, in ground war on tavorsk you can find a camping spot on a high-up rooftop and target vehicles pretty easily while they're still deep in their own territory and unlikely to get blown up before your rocket reaches them. use tactical insertion and tune-up so you can suicide when you're out of ammo and respawn back in your launcher blind with full pockets.",-0.9947,0.173,0.753,0.074

launcher kills - shipment hardcore. keep spamming the rocket each time you spawn.

7022,"i'd recommend leveling up the launchers to the max level before you start going for camos because there are a lot of camo categories that overlap.

i leveled all the launchers up in plunder. pop a double weapon xp token, grab a chopper, and run supply run contracts. you can max out each launcher in like 3 games.

i saved the launchers to the end as well, and all i can say is... good luck haha",0.9531,0.026,0.718,0.256
7023,"alright will be sure to try them out soon. yeah bro the only different camo category is the attacker/defender and the kill enemies category. the other ones are pretty much the same and always count in every category.

yeah bro i�m starting to regret leaving the launchers for last lol. but hey, if i had done the launchers first, then i might not be able to complete my shield, knife and pistols lol.

7025,"yup i�m playing ffa at the moment to get the kill streaks done first on all the launchers now that sts is gone so when it comes back, i can just focus on getting the attacker/defender kills done.

yeah bro grinding the levels are pretty tiring but still, it�s better than grinding weapons on cold war where it is extremely slow, even with double xp on. i might try to go on plunder and spam supply run contracts to get the launchers to max level first before grinding the camos. would be a waste to do the same thing repeatedly since most of the camos on the launchers are just similar to each other.

then for the actual challenges, you will want to shoot every kill streak you see.
specially go for counter uavs, personal radars, uavs and vtols, because these kill streaks count as ground based kill streaks and regular kill streaks.

in some occasions if you tell people before the match starts, that you are doing challenges for the launchers they might help.

specific map strategies:
in shipment, with the (joker) try finding a domination or capture based objetive. your goal is to stand on either a flag or c flag and shoot to the opposite one. so you basically stand on c and aim to the wall of containers, as close to the a flag, this should count as attacker and defending kills.

mount on the side of deployable cover so you get crouched kills too!
use ""camo"" in ur clan tag, so people know you grinding camo and wont blame or call you camper, sometimes they even help you!
some of the guns have very high recoil like scar or oden or ak47, putting them in semi auto mode is very effective, cuz you have more control over it, specially for longshot.
use damage range attachment on weaker guns like smg or m13 cuz the have high rof but less damage, so u get hitmarker in longrange, but that attachment will help u.

to get to the the safe menu on your ps5, turn it off

1) hold the power button until it beeps, continue to hold until it beeps a second time (about 7 seconds). release power button

the worst part to me is how hard it is for activision to release the 3 guns that are already playable. would it really hurt activision to release 3 guns that we can already use? is cw really so bad, that giving 3 guns to the old game would kill it? what's stopping them? cw is already selling well, it's not like the game is going to lose 50% of it's revenue by adding guns to an old game. they don't need to add anything else, they don't need to add any new maps, game modes, or cosmetics. just the guns. it's not hard.",-0.9639,0.154,0.761,0.085

just for reference this has happened with the following packs:


tacgas
grinch lion
domino rainbow
ronin samurai 
roze unmasked

in the case of the very last, roze, after enough people brought attention to it on twitter the devs fixed it later on in the day. to reiterate, people have had these packs show up in the store in the past month and they own them. while most of us have not even seen it once. 

what happens here is the store doesn�t show new mw packs for everyone. in fact only a select few even see them. regions don�t matter, platforms don�t matter. there is no rhyme or reason as to why you�ll see a pack or not. in the case of roze you had two people in the exact same region with the same platforms and one saw it while his friend didn�t. 

it�s pretty disappointing to see that even after being made aware of this issue they still haven�t fixed it. we have iskra, soap and spark bundles that are left. assuming it�s bugged with all of them they likely won�t fix any except soap as the outrage over the bug will exceed that of roze.",0.7184,0.039,0.881,0.08

use the shortest barrel on the fal. it helps the hipfire a lot, and the gun is supposed to be medium to long range so idk why you're trying to hipfire with it.

so if we consider hardline to not count as a 'real' perk, is the following correct?

with hardline: start with 2 perks, 3 perks at 1 kill, 4 perks at 3 kills, 5 perks at 5 kills, all perks at 7 kills

8909,eod + quick fix is a godsend for hp/dom. being on an objective doubles health regen speed so if you get grenaded you're back to full health in 2 seconds. i like it because it frees up my secondary to be stuns or snapshots,0.8225,0.0,0.789,0.211
8910,"use it as perk 6 (last perk in the streak). hardline essentially means you're operating on one less perk. if you start with hardline as perk 2 then you're down a perk each time you spawn in. if you're someone who is aiming for specialist then it's best to have it as the last perk, that way you have 5 perks by kill 4, then by the time you get to kill 6 it doesn't really matter that you're not really gaining anything, as it now only takes 1 more kill to get all perks

having said that you could run hardline as a perk 2 if you aren't bothered about the other perk 2 and you aren't aiming for specialist bonus every time. for example if you run eod + hardline with quick fix as the first unlock, youll get quick fix after kill 1 and it activates instantly, so it's essentially like running quick fix + eod

also sometimes i like running hardline + amped, with shrapnel as first unlock. shrapnel actually gives you the second explosive for free when you unlock it, so if kill 1 is a grenade kill then you get the grenade back instantly. for explosive-focused classes, having both amped + shrapnel is a massive help. shrapnel affects all explosives including rpg, so shrapnel + amped is giving you faster equipment use and rocket reload combined with the heath regen effect of shrapnel",-0.9091,0.123,0.786,0.091

things that have led me to believe this is not only this subreddit pointing out the obvious things like playlist changes but also what cw is doing, they have let xbox turn cross play off (somthing i personally wanted in warzone) cw even allows you to change fov on console.... i mean this should of been in mw on the same update surly?? 

mix all of that with having to slowly remove the campaign data pack then spec op's and inevitably multiplayer down the line, it feels like that time apple purposely slowed down the iphone to make you upgrade you know.

this makes me insane.  i buy discs because they can be resold, or more likely, lent to friends.  and, i don't trust the 'system'.  just look at all those people who lost their entire oculus libraries because facebook decided they were frauds.

9700,"for mw respawn you'd want higher sens, for search and wz you'd want lower sens.  you have to check multiple angles at a time for respawn but for search and wz there's only a few angles to check and you can do really well at long ranges with lower sens, more accuracy.  so it depends on which mode you prefer.  one requires wrist for high sens, other require arm with low sens.

but, it all depends on you and what youre comfortable with.  to me it's much more benefitial to be both arm and wrist aim.  i suggest you learn about mouse acceleration and implement it in your set up, so you can get both low mouse sens while using reg guns that uses arm, and then fast wrist flicks that accel to high sens for quick 90-180s for fast reaction kills and corner checks.

thx",0.7269,0.12,0.709,0.17
9703,"let me just say this: you should use whatever you're more comfortable with. when aiming, consistency is key, doesn't matter whether you aim with your wrist or arm. being comfortable will let you be more consistent.

i personally am in a weird spot as i don't entirely aim with my wrist or arm, i'm sort of a hybrid but i use a smaller pad with a wrist rest and a heavier mouse. with that in mind, i use 1000 dpi with 10.43 sensitivity and 1x ads multiplier.

my advice to you is, instead of orientating based on some numbers, find what kind of arm and wrist movement you're most comfortable with (physically comfortable), then find which numbers work best with that kind of movement.",0.9422,0.019,0.861,0.121
9704,"just stop. you put the sensitivity to what you find comfortable not what other peoples are.

a good start is go in a private match, close your eyes and move your mouse to what you think a 180 or a 360 should be. if you over/undershoot, adjust accordingly.

as a general rule, when you play any kind of shooter turn off vsync, turn off mouse acceleration and turn off mouse smoothing (these two are the same in some games, different in others). these alone will make you improve massively. 

 i'd also recommend just turning on uniform aim sensitivity so your ads speed and hipfire are the same (this is so you are only learning 1 sensitivity and not 2). also try to keep your sensitivities between games the same. 

lastly, i read in a comment in this thread someone swapped to pc in the last 10 months and is constantly changing their sensitivity. never, ever, ever do this. you are only making it harder for yourself, we are creatures of habit. you just need to condition yourself to subconsciously know how far you have to move your mouse and constantly changing your sensitivity is doing the opposite. 

&#x200b;

for me i play on higher sensitivities and use my wrist more than my arm due to limitations in my mouse space when i first started out. i would recommend going for mainly arm and wrist for micro adjustments though. 

since you are new too i'd rebind all your keyboard keys so the you are using tfgh instead of wasd for movement. this will give you alot more surrounding keys to bind to things in games, most of us use wasd but this is because this is how we started playing and changing it would throw things off. since you are starting out now would be a great time to change to this.",0.9403,0.01,0.923,0.067

so one day, iw in their infinite wisdom, not only did further reduce the volume of footsteps, they massively increased sound occlusion.

for those who don't know what sound occlusion is: it's how objects in a 3d space block sound.

they couldn't just slightly increase it. no no no no. they had to go balls deep so they went from footsteps that were unplayably loud to footsteps that are unplayably silent. it's not really the volume that's the issue, it's the massive inconsistencies due to super sound occlusion.",-0.1441,0.147,0.729,0.124

* most tactical do something here, in cw with the tactical mask you are literally inmune, so yeah you cannot be flushed out in cw

* most maps have a lot of ways to reach the objective, so if you keep dying you can either kill the enemy now that you know where he is or take a different route

- lmgs and tac rifles don't conform to the slower ttk, and they're naturally less ""i'm going to run around"" type guns

- snipers are literally uncounterable head on.

- field mic

- flak jacket might as well making you invincible against explosives, so it's impossible to flush people out.

- no fmj equivalent (in terms of wall-banging)

- perk greed is free, and gives an extra perk slot for all 3 categories.

- stims recharge without quartermaster (same concept as restock in mw, for those not aware)

really your only penance is ninja always being active, and to a very small extent, ghost only being while moving. but modern doesn't have nearly as much camping. why? simple, few to none of these issues are there. mounting is a free kill to whoever can beam your exposed face, so the people who do it are generally going for challenges, and people love to over-exaggerate how doors work, since they don't really change too many scenarios.

most people are not aware but the following bundles have already been released:

tacgas lerch
ronin crimson samurai
domino rainbow tracers
grinch lion


the only operator skins remaining from the december update are iskras white chapel, soap and sparks. 

if we don�t raise awareness to this issue soap is gonna be released just like all the others where only a few can see him in the store. 

it would really help if we could get a dedicated thread for this stickied to the top of this reddit so the developers who browse here can see this in time.

they don�t owe you anything, anymore, the only left is the guns and soap, which would be added sometimes later as i have read. if you don�t play warzone, which is fine, but if you didn�t buy any from the store, didn�t buy cw. you really have no rights to demand them for stuffs. you aren�t paying them more cash and they wouldn�t do it even with your cash handled to them, because fixing old stuffs isn�t as profitable as making new stuffs. and quite frankly they don�t care if they hurts your feelings or not. this is activision, this is their way, either live with it, or don�t. play something else, stop hurting yourself by being disappointed about things that happen annually.",0.9638,0.067,0.797,0.136

every other game on market stopped annual release bullshit and splitting the playerbase. cs:go is most played fps game on the market and it was released in 2012. it went through tons of seasons with new maps comming all the time and old ones getting remastered. it will switch to source 2 (new valve engine) in 2021, since it's still running on source engine that didn't get a major update since 2008.

same with fortnite. remember when fortnite br was a shitty free addition to fortnite the game, the one you play pretty much tower defense? took epic years to turn fortnite in what it is. 

same with r6 siege. game was dogshit during release, barely broke 5k active players after 2 months on steam. devs sticked to it to fix balance, add new maps and weapons, they kept improving it and it's arguable 3rd largest compeative fps on the market after cs:go and valorant. 

activision after slow decline of series since cod: ghosts finally got a diamond in the rough with mw2019 and what they do? they double down on their retarded model of releasing new game and splitting playerbase.

people would pay $60 easily if new black ops was just a big campaign addon with zombies for mw2019, while giving some skins for multiplayer of mw2019 and warzone. every fucking weapon in cold war could be just a blueprint for mw2019, prove me wrong. they could even add few weapons to mp if they wanted to like awp. they didn't need to add two ar15 (xm4 and m16), they didn't need to add 2nd ak47, they didn't need to add 2nd galil.",-0.8191,0.114,0.792,0.094

meaning they have no intention to continue supporting their most successful cod game to date. cod mw 2019 sold the most copies of any cod game in the history of cod. but should they continue to support it? well apparently they don't think so, cod warzone i guess is far more financially successful i guess and they keep trying to get more people roped into cold war despite that having sold substantially less copies than even previous cod titles.

a good way to find out your mouse sens relative to someone else's sensitivity is by edpi. to do that, multiply your dpi by your in game sensitivity. for example, i'm on 1800dpi at a 6.5 sensitivity, so my edpi is 11700. 

also, you can find your cm/360 using a calculator online. just search for cm/360 calculator warzone. in cod, 25-45cm/360 is pretty average. i'm at a 12cm/360, which is way too high for most people. at 3000dpi, i'd assume you're in the same ballpark as me, it might be worthwhile turning your sensitivity down if you're not used to controlling long range tracking with your fingertips.

&#x200b;

i just got damascus in january... **here's my advice**.

a lot of people online say ground war is bad for getting launcher progress, i say that's a lie. when i was grinding, i found that i was almost always getting progress on killstreak and vehicle-based challenges each match, almost guaranteed. you just have to really pay attention.

first get all of your launcher kills in hardcore shoot the ship, then go into ground war. the things to look out for are *any* player-operated ground vehicle, vtol jets, personal radars, uavs\* and counter-uavs.

*\*(with some practice and watching youtube video demonstrations, you can shoot down uavs with the strela and the rpg despite the lack of lock on capability.)*

equip the spotter perk and cold-blooded. equip munitions boxes to replenish 1 rocket. vtol jets are easy prey for free-fire rockets, especially for the rpg-7. that weapon in particular requires only 3 rockets to fully down a vtol. also, turn on subtitles and *really* pay attention to the announcer voices. listen for ""enemy uav overhead"", ""enemy vtol"", etc etc. personal radars are not announced by the announcer in ground war, but with the spotter perk they will show up on your map and be visible via a red outline through walls.

tanks are good for splinter camo. try your best to interpret where enemy tank drivers are travelling to, and be at that objective before they get there so you can surprise them with rockets. hitting tanks from the rear results in a critical hit, dealing more damage. disabling a tank will result in it eventually exploding, counting towards your progress.

&#x200b;

some ground war maps i found the most success on:

**karst river quarry** *(lots of cover to quickly run through the map, pursuing vehicles and getting closer to air streaks for a clean shot.)*

**krovnik farmland** *(sticking around the b, c, and d objectives, i was able to shoot down lots of vtols and destroy many tanks)*

**verdansk international airport** *(sticking to the c objective and staying on the roof, i was able to target many tanks as the c objective is a popular spot for tanks to rush and vtols to be called in overhead.)*

**verdansk riverside** *(this map fucking sucks in my opinion but it's a small enough map where you should be able to target personal radars with lock-on weapons effectively. but a small map means high player density, so when you're trying to get closer to prs with non-lock-on weapons like the rpg, often times you'll just get killed which is frustrating.)*

&#x200b;

sorry for the long winded response but i feel like i was able to really perfect my craft when it comes to getting plat launchers, so to speak. wishing you the best of luck, you can do this! launchers was perhaps the most tedious of the damascus grind, but it is still achievable!

&#x200b;

p.s. i've permanently switched from the uav to the personal radar to make the damascus grind for people like you just *a little bit easier.* hopefully we'll match up so you can farm my radar drones for progress lol",0.8779,0.121,0.751,0.127

12001,"usually they are rather easy to counter, given you have sufficient skill. i personally don't have any problem with those techniques (i have a 4.26kd and 3.6 w/l), so let me just share a couple of options with you:

1. use his bunnyhop to your advantage.

this depends a lot on how skilled the enemy is and what gun he uses, but generally he will tac sprint before the bunnyhop, which gives you somewhere between 150-300ms of sprintout time, where you can shoot, but he can't. as long as you are able to hit your shots and track him, you have a very good chance of killing him. if you have a hard time tracking, make sure you have a high enough sensitivity (or at least ads sensitivity)

2. bait

you know he's coming? great, let him jump into empty space and after he wasted his movement, just pop out and kill him. don't just stand there, be less predictable and let him expose himself to a bad position while you obtain a better one

3. your own movement

usually the techniques have some little weakspots and shortcomings. for example dropshots make you very immobile and slow to turn, so fast movements work well against it. bunnyhops are generally done with a direction in mind, so a well placed slide towards him can mess up whatever plan he had pretty good

4. positioning

more of a general tip - be mindful of your positioning on the map, where the enemies are, what lines of sight exist on you, where your teammates are, etc. if you have good awareness, you can try to put yourself in advantageous situations or just avoid that guy if you don't feel confident in facing him",-0.3563,0.14,0.721,0.139

12039,"i got damascus in january, here's my advice:

&#x200b;

if you're going to do some camo grinding, set aside your mode preference and understand that the shoot the ship playlist is your best friend. i guarantee that you will spend significantly less time on your camo grind this way and you'll get it out of the way so much quicker.

the player density of shipment means you'll get kills extremely rapidly. if you die, the spawns are so busted that you spawn right back in the fight, and you might as well not have died in the first place. reptile camos require 75 kills with no attachments, if you average 30 kills in 1 shipment match you can see how quickly you'll breeze through it.

shoothouse is good for getting your longshots / mounted kills in tandem with each other by camping mid. it's not a gracious process, but it gets the job done. for pistols, however, you can score longshot medals on shipment, so no need to bother with shoothouse. you need to stand as far back as you can though, shooting at people on the other side of the map. 

&#x200b;

and as with what others have said, if the killing power of the weapon you are using is just not enough, you can also load into the hardcore variant of shoot the ship. but personally, i found core shipment to be so chaotic that i was able to reliably get lots of kills even with the worst weapons grinding no attachment kills lol.

&#x200b;

i've seen that 2 more banwaves have happened recently, and no doubt innocents have been hit by those waves too. i'm personally over cod for now and am planning on looking back in a few months to see if i get unbanned or not. also made the decision to not spend a dime on any of their future release too.",-0.6997,0.072,0.889,0.039

2nd time - dud. barely any info, took forever, largely didn't care.

3rd time - amazing. this guy cared about his job, and cared about the customer. went out of his way to research, and gave me more details surrounding the process.

4th time - my account was already restored, but again, this guy was pretty great, and explained things thoroughly.

also, not sure how much it helped, but i tried to be as up-front as possible concerning my this was so serious, how the hacker had been inviting my friends into games, and also severing existing connections i had with other players. they said they would add the details to my case, so i'm not sure if that also helped to speed things along at all.

i know it would've been massively demanding but had they just added cold war onto the side of modern warfare, so you go into a ""call of duty launcher"" and from there you pick which one you want to play, that would've been way better than the modern warfare logo changing to stitch with price pushed to the side, the background as your pc/console loads the files for the game being stitch, the ""connecting to datacenters"" screen being stitch, but a full body shot this time, and then having cold war being the default for your starting spot for the loading screen, along with the usual ""buy in the pack shop"" and ""hey you wanna try cold war"" in the tips section (both of which im fine with)",-0.8655,0.129,0.763,0.108

however, none of what they have done appears to be illegal to me. unethical, discourteous to the customer base, misleading -  yes. illegal, no. this is a case of lawful evil. and activision is beholden to shareholders who want more revenue.

there is something to understand - anyone who bought mw did not ""buy"" a game - they bought a license to play a game. you don't even own the license, it is issued to you by activision, and the license can be revoked or terminated under the conditions stated in the tos and the software license agreement. none of us own the game. this is typically how proprietary software works.

more importantly here, the software licensing agreement and the tos allows activision to change the content at any time, at their discretion - without notice or consent. these legally binding documents (that were agreed to by anyone who installed the game) also state that the game is not guaranteed to be fully functional/playable at all times - a fine cover-your-ass for activision releasing broken updates. and furthermore, activision can kill the game entirely at any time for any reason - by simply terminating access to the game to everyone who bought a license to play the game. 

please understand that i'm not supporting activision and their decision to basically make mw a billboard for cold war, i'm just explaining how they are able to do what they've done and not get into any legal hot water over it. 

next time you go to install a game or any other program, grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink to keep you awake and fully read the tos and/or license agreement before installing. heck, even compare a license for open source software to proprietary software. actually see what rights you truly have as a consumer.",-0.9243,0.112,0.795,0.093

nothing we've seen in terms of updates and seasons gives us a clue as to what they will do with the new weapons (seems like only playlists get updated about half as often as during the mw seasons).

i think the most likely answer is that devs were told to continue building weapons for new mw seasons up until the point where the weapons were half-added to the game in anticipation of a new season, but then were told to just shut it down and work on something else, either cw or the next title for their specific studio out of the 3 that produce cod titles. i suspect the global season progress design decision had something to do with that.",-0.5213,0.076,0.868,0.056

13432,"i think overall, i prefer modern warfare, but it's a very close match up for a few reasons, since there's loads of things i like/dislike about both games.

first off, i think cold war is way faster paced. the removal of mounting and faster base movement speed makes the whole experience a lot faster than modern warfare. the ads speed also compliments this, as it's a considerable amount faster than mw. i like that.

however, i really like modern warfare's design and aesthetic. i think the graphics are better, and i prefer the modern settings over the 80s spy theme. also, mw's weapons sound and look way better. they're way more detailed, and their sound design makes them feel powerful. everything in cw sounds like it's silenced.

the maps in both games aren't great, but overall i prefer cw's maps as they're smaller with no doors. though, some of the later mw maps that were added are quite decent.

footsteps in both games are way too loud. camo's in both games are decent but personal preference - i think diamond camo in cw is far better than any camo in both the games. again, that's personal preference, some people might hate it, but i personally think it looks better than dm or damascus. dm is better than damascus though.

worst thing mw did tho is not having dead silence as a perk.",0.9543,0.141,0.616,0.243

as far as **gameplay**/**gunplay**, modern warfare and cold war are nearly identical, aside from a few differences in the pace of matches, visual recoil, and gun attachments. 

and while i see the complaints about camping, i honestly don't feel one game is more or less camp-y than the other.

modern warfare, i think, is definitely the prettier of the two, for sure. mw has cooler operator and weapon design too.

that said that's all it has. don't get me wrong mw dosen't have zombies but if you compare pvp multiplayers cw does not even compare to mw. the map design is garbage and looks like it's been drawn for the aestetic factor. all those maps look like they were designed for campers and have no strategical interest. in mw each map has oportunities for close range and long range engagement. you can flank or go around, choose the best aproach for your playstyle. make tactics. cold war is just a bunch of corners lined up together. but it has nuketown!...again. i know it's a fan favourite but damn they could create actual good new maps. create new classics.

and don't get me started on performance and visuals. cold war looks like someone tried to copy cod but didn't quite put in the effort.

if you want a game with no campers, go play something like titanfall 2, which is in my opinion, a way better fps than both cw and mw. it's an fps where campers are punished so severely by those who are even just somewhat competent with the movement.",-0.6296,0.178,0.652,0.171

i noticed yesterday that my ping was around 34 ms, and there was someone literally oneshotting me with an amax.
the amax fires 620 rounds every minute, which is around 10 every second.

it takes three chest shots to kill with the amax. it fires 10 shots in a second so it should fire three shots in a third of a second, so it should be able to kill me in 0.333 seconds, or 333 ms.

if my ping is 34ms then at it�s lowest the ttk should be 333ms - 34ms, which is roughly 300ms.

i should have just below 300ms to react. the ttk was damn near instant.

i believe with wz being the forefront of the franchise now, we can expect updates to that vs mw in general, aside from the multiplayer playlist updates.

there are 3 guns (the 80 round fully automatic pistol, a lmg, and the skorpion evo smg) & 2 operators (soap & sparks) that have been data mined, so there is a slight possibility that there could be a battle pass for those in future, but i doubt it. i could see them both being in a store bundle for 2400 a piece ($40) vs a $10 battle pass, and i could see the guns being like a mid season release if they decide to but the only gun available is the pistol, which is slightly bugged in a sense where as its only a purchasable item in spec ops. also, there are plenty of things data mined in the files that will never see the light of day.

the customer support is pathetic for a company that makes this much money.  the phone number will never be answered, it runs you around in circles telling you to go to the support website, the website sucks  and severely limits your options.  

if you go through the steps to request help they push you toward ""account recovery request"" but it also says ""other suggestions"" under that, which i always ignored, because it is useless stuff like ""create strong passwords.""  it turns out that sometimes, there is a button to chat with a rep in there.  sometimes the button doesn't work- launches a chat window that never loads-  sometimes it simply isn't there, and sometimes it works and you have to wait 2 hours because you are 200th in line.  i did that and after a fairly long chat they said they couldn't help me, because i logged in with a new account so i could get to the chat window, but it being a new account, they couldn't do anything for the real account.

finally, i learned that i have to log in with my xbox id, not my activision account, which is then locked by 2fa, but it has my foot in the door enough to ask for help with that account... and nothing since then.  the landing page between the login and the 2fa gave me an option to send an email, i got a ticket number emailed to me and no news yet- it has been less than a week since i did that.  it implies that i am entitled to send an email because i've had an account for so long, if you don't get that option you have to progress towards the chat options i mentioned earlier.

14186,"i started playing mw since in the middle of season 1 last year (feb 23), and it was all smooth sailing for me. my game went through at least four hardware changes including one major one, the installation has been moved back and forth between multiple disks many times, and i went through all six seasons for the year without any frequent crashes whatsoever at all. had maybe one or two rare crashes in my life...

all until the season 1 ""refresh"" update that came out at the end of the year that brought in black ops into the loading screens and menus and changed the game icon from mw to warzone. everything's gone massively downhill for me from there. the game would start crashing to desktop with an error message after just two or three matches or so. a few patch updates later, it's become even worse. now i can't play a single match without a chance that it will crash at all. the game has become totally unplayable for me. it's sooo bad to the point that when i start up the game, it now has a 66% chance of crashing right when, or even before the splash screen shows up. and it's even affecting black ops in the same way too, presumably since it is partially loading mw for its main menu. very annoying.

when i try the scan and repair option, all it results in is an endless loop of scan then blzbntagt00000bb8 error that i cannot get out of, until i either mess with the pause button on the updating part just before it turns into scan and repair, or delete these 1kb sized data files inside the data folder in the game folder as someone on a battle.net thread suggested to do when getting an error loop like this.

i'm going to reinstall my mw game for the first time soon since i still quite enjoy mw multiplayer and like it in some ways more than cold war. hopefully the reinstall fixes all these annoying glitches that even the scan and repair tool seems to have trouble with fixing. just thought i'd share my story here, as all i could find on google about mw crashing after season 1 update was just posts dating all the way back to late october 2020 or the season 6 era. it took me some scrolling through this subreddit in the ""new"" order to find this post. thanks.",-0.9594,0.09,0.868,0.042

14227,"there isn't usually a definitive way to straight up boost your fps unfortunately, at least not a considerable degree.

there are however some things you can do if you haven't already done so, to give yourself a tiny improvement:

make sure in your nvidia control panel, your power mode is set to prefer maximum performance. you can mess around with a few of the other settings in here specifically for mw too if you go to program settings. don't know how effective they'd be though.

set your game priority to above normal or high in task manager (never set it to realtime as this makes things unstable)

make sure your game is in fullscreen - this reduces input lag and does increase fps since you're not rendering in anything in the background.

overclocking - if your pc isn't currently overclocked, you could, if you are comfortable, oc either your gpu or cpu. again, only do this if you are comfortable with doing it, and know what you're doing.

all in all though, the best way to increase fps is unfortunately just to get better hardware, but i tried to offer some things that i used to do when i had a 1060.",0.8451,0.042,0.857,0.101

more ram ( i went 8 to 16 and it definitely prevents what rare stutter i got)

edit: also, probably not applicable but people with higher end hardware that run higher settings have found it beneficial to use a framelimit to encourage smoothness.
i recall in older games that could help too even if the frsme limit was set to something like the average rhe system would achieve anyway.

if i play tdm i usually look at my k/d to evaluate my performence in that game but my overall k/d really dosen't say anything. if dying can bring a strategic advantage to my team i will. that said you will hear a lot of people talking about their k/d like it's their baby. they will usually let your team loose a game cause they dosen't want to push and damage their ratio.

as for w/l it means nothing in this game. the matchmaking seems to throw you in hard matches when you win games and easy matches when you loose. so really what does this ratio say when the game controls who you play against? if the matchmaking was random then you could conpare but comparing riged numbers is useless.",0.1945,0.133,0.735,0.132

however, in shoot house i notice that the details of the map disappear and everything looks like a blue constant. this makes it very difficult to aim and recognize the environment around especially if someone is running cold blooded they are basically invisible. i noticed this only on shoot house, all the other maps look fine.

unless you play warzone and use the cw/wz exclusive unlocks extensively (in which case, you're better off posting in r/warzone about it), the battlepass litterally has no other merit than the cod points and double xp tokens for mw multiplayer.

still, i agree with you that the past 2 weeks have been severely undermining those who don't have that much time to play in the first place. there is one consolidation at this time though: you get double battle pass progress when you play warzone. personally i highly recommend plunder (or blood money) in that case.",0.9152,0.079,0.729,0.192

also, one other odd thing i've noticed. whenever i click play in battle net on the game, the first launch seems to instantly crash. the second launch will then throw the ""safe mode"" warning dialog box indicating the game previously crashed.",0.6486,0.109,0.753,0.138
14764,"i would recommend updating your bios first. it's nowhere near as ""scary"" to do with modern uefi bios as it was before uefi came along. depending on the manufacturer of your motherboard, it may even have a failsafe (like asus). 

if you are worried that you may brick your mb and whether or not it's covered by warranty, you could contact your retailer's service desk to make sure your warranty covers failed bios flashing. make sure to write down the name of the service representative in case anything goes wrong, and ask them if they know for certain if it's covered or, if not, ask them to confirm with one of their colleagues.

ask them if it's okay to stay on the phone while you go through the flashing process.

i'm on a gaming laptop with an 8th gen i7 hex-core cpu and gtx 1060 6gb gpu when i play warzone with my friends. normally i play on ps4.

even after moving the game to my already limited capacity boot m.2 ssd, the game would get frame drops whenever an enemy got near me. i disabled highlights and i have been playing without issues ever since.

now that they've blended  cw, wz and mw via wz i'd think it'd be awkward having ww ii guns along side modern weaps that can shred at medium and long range.  irl weapon technology improves fire rates, hip fire accuracy, velocity, impact, gun handling, reload speed, field ability (dirty conditions).  playing wz with a m1 garand or a thompson .45 machine gun vs.  ak-47, mac-10, etc.  not really gonna work i feel.  thoughts?",0.4349,0.155,0.679,0.166

the problem - no real anticheat.  the second problem - bad kids report because no way someone can be better at the game.  all it takes is a whole team to report you a couple of times and then you will be shadowbanned.  third problem - peekers advantage exists in this game but people do not realize it. someone coming around a corner will see someone camping before the camper can see the aggressor. it is not as bad as rb6, but still noteworthy.

fair warning before you do this... its actually a fairly easy repair, but if you pull up that little white connector that the ribbon fits into, you will be faced with like 30 teeny tiny wires that you will never be able to fit back inside the connector. trust me i know this as i did this on accident and had to buy another controller.",0.9398,0.049,0.816,0.135

15690,"my brother was a big cod player (ps3) back in the day. once he went to school and started working he stopped playing as much. due to the pandemic, he has a little more time at home to play now. he was frustrated that his muscle memory on the controller was gone and played through a lot of frustration trying to get better. 2 weeks ago, i gave him an old keyboard and mouse that i had and he changed his gaming setup. he has never gamed on keyboard and mouse before, and has pretty much learned through my teachings. he is currently playing on the ps4 with mouse & keys. his k/d ratio in warzone has increased from about .7 (flat over 3-4 months with controller) to 1.3 in a matter of weeks with mouse and keys.

15852,"i think with mine, i normally do

ingore spray paint, kills happen by playing

headshots i ignore for the minute

crouching, again these come easily, normally done about the same time as tiger

hipfire i build a build just for hipfire, look up slightly and try to get as many headshots as i can while doing it, the rest just come normally. for pistols, i usually left this till last, because akimbo was really useful for this one, except with the deagle, it was shit with the deagle

mounted and longshots done at the same time,

tiger is just passive, but this is what ive asked for the builds for

stripes, i normally have sleight of hand on my class, but if im struggling, i shoot a bullet in spawn then reload just before i get into a gunfight

reptile is easy in hardcore

lichyard is averagely annoying, it takes me anywhere from like 10-20 games to do, but isn't overly difficult

doublekills come and go, i don't focus on these

&#x200b;

the main maps i play are khandor, hardhat, scrapyard, shoothouse, shipment, rust, atlas, gun runner and cheshire park with sawmil occasionally thrown in, it depends on my mood.

kandor is great all round, tyre shop side is good for crouched and hipfire kills, courtyard side is good for longshots, you can get most challenges done here tbh

hardhat is great for mounted kills, and if you camp in the room by a, its really good for the riot shield too

scrapyard is good in every aspect to be honest

shoothouse and shipment are the goat

rust is good for longshots and mounted kills too, and just generic kill challenges

on atlas, b side is great for longshots if you camp around there, the other side is pretty good for generic kill challenges

gun runner is pretty good, minecarts is great for mounted kills, if you camp on the pipe or containers, it's good for longshots and crouched kills

cheshire is great for snipers and marksman rifles and longshots, there's a pixel peek in the restaurant opposite the shop, so i just kill the campers there

&#x200b;

done the launchers and shield, the launchers were way easier than people made them out to be, they were just time-consuming

riot shield was pure pain especially for skulls, but that's done too, as well as the knife, vacant is the best map for these, no discussion. play hardcore for the riot shield and kali sticks, core for the knife and katanas

shotguns i did when shoot the ship was in for like a month over summer last year, but on hardcore these can be done anywhere, just dont use dragons breath otherwise you're scum

smgs i got the mp5 and 7 done over summer too and blitzed the last 4 out over the weekend, the best maps are pretty much anywhere, just avoid arklov and granza raid

snipers are best on atlas, cheshire park woods and trains on gun runner and maybe rust, hold down longer sight lines where you only have to look one direction

lmgs work well anywhere, really

ars, im not too sure about, not really played with them much

riot shield is dogshit, best on vacant tho, the room by a on hardhat is pretty good too

pistold are goated if you can aim quickly on hardcore, they work well pretty much anywhere, chuck extended mag, mono suppressor, sleight of hand, stippled grip tape and a micro reflex on them or extended mag (biggest you can get) mono suppressor, stippled grip tape, 5mw laser and akimbo

revolver snakeshot rounds, sleight of hand, 5mw laser(1mw laser), stippled grip tape, akimbo (sleight of hand)

launchers take ages but theyre piss easy, on shipment, take c and b, then with the jokr shoot the wall above a, will kill anyone in that corner, with the others, just quickscope the floor by a flag, should be easy enough, or shoot one of the walls on shipment while stood on your own flag

for launcher killstreak challenges, prioritise personal radars, they count for all 6 challenges so will get you there the fastest, the next best are vtols and counter uavs, as they count as 5 challenges each

i tend to run cold blooded, ghost and amped, but i can see arguments for tracker, spotter, restock and double time, the rest i dont see a benefit for

top-level opinion: i don't use no-stock, except for meme-builds. i think it affects aiming-stability too much. for hardcore especially, you want a bullet to go in the same spot everytime.

mg34 is, imo, the ultimate ambush gun in the game. the bipod helps loads, as does the muzzlebreak. otherwise, it depends on your tolerance for it's characteristics. (full ads build isn't as awful as you might expect).

ak can be finicky with the odd recoil pattern. you either way to tap your 1-3 round bursts or rely on 5-10 round sprays. in hardcore, this is an excellent rare example of a weapon which is absolutely valid to swap between semi- and full-auto based on the range of engagement that you're expecting. my favourite ak build in all modes is:

- rds (everyone has their own preference)
- skele stock
- ranger grip
- muzzle break
- soh or fmj

fal is my baby. i could write you an essay on the fal in various modes. for hc specifically, it kind of depends on your tolerance for velocity, but i'd just go for a mobility build:

- rds
- short barrel
- aluminium stock
- ranger or merc (whether your want more accurate aimed or hip fire) or tactical (if you can handle the recoil but want more aimed accuracy)
- soh",0.8,0.022,0.905,0.073

handler, kitty, agony, exo, futives, they're all still uploading mw. jev has recently started uploading mw again but i'm sure he'll stop again first chance he gets. he's the only one on that list who doesn't actually believe mw is the better game, though he does acknowledge it has the better engine and gunplay.

marksman and spratt on the other hand are still uploading cold war. you can't get em all. if anyone would rather play cw it's fair game of course but i don't think the previous-year cod has ever been this popular this shortly after the release of the latest one, ever?

about 90% of the mw19 bundles are taken out of the warzone client completely, and only purchasable through the mw19 multi-player store.

so first of all you need a tester weapon. something that is very stable and fun to use. m4 or kilo would work. if you keep switching weapons you don't actually improve cause you spend all your time adjusting to you gun. so once you have a nice gun that will shoot straight, you start on the low end of the sens bar and you go up. try one game per point. each game go up. you'll find a comfortable spot at some point but you are not done yet. once you think you found the spot, go up still. do the eye test method. a is good? is b better than a? b...a. ok b is better. is c better than b? and so on.

1-if you shoot first with a one shot weapon you will win the fight. this set up isn't optimal to start with.

2-the dragon breath dude will see your laser and shoot you first. dragon breath wins.

3-as good as the m4 is, you need a few bullet in the dude to kill him. dragon breath wins.

4- if you didn't have overkill you could have ghost, which means uav's don't spot you. if you are on the minimap dragon breath wins.

5- no silencers mean the dude will hear you coming if you drop a single bullet. dragon breath wins.

6- when you have heart beat sensor in your hands you don't have a gun. dragon breath wins.

7- disableing only works if you shoot the legs...dont shoot the legs. this is a whole other attachment you could use to hit more shots or move faster which could help you win against a dragon breath.

8- you have a shotgun secondary and an underbarel shotgun. thats just waste. your m4 has to be the worst class ive ever seen.

now is this set up better than running a dragon breath? i mean there is more range so yes. you are more versatile. in close range situations? you could still use the broken weapon to sweat people better. but do you want to be that guy?",0.6872,0.112,0.765,0.123

16782,"hey there, this is the fastest way i found to level the new unreleased weapons in survival mode if you want to be slightly ahead of the curve when they do release.

how it works: this works by achieving and maintaining a 9x multiplier by using sentry gun killstreak purchased at the kiosk, as this multiplies the amount of weapon ex you get per kill. (sentry gun kills count as normal gun kills)

step 1: unlock the new weapons in multiplayer, through their corresponding challenges. the sykov pistol is unlocked by getting 4 pistol kills with a pistol in 5 different multiplayer matches and the cx-9 smg is unlocked through getting 2 smg longshots in 5 different multiplayer matches.

step 2: queue survival, and try to get a map that has a good defendable location that is also reasonably close to the killstreak kiosk. due to the low amount of damage you can take, it�s best to have a camping spot where you can funnel enemies to you from only one direction. the maps i found worked best were shoot house, superstore, grazna raid, and azhir cave. make sure to regularly buy armor from the killstreak kiosk.

step 3: if you have a full squad play normally until the enemy counter per round is about 35-40 enemies per round at which point start you start placing sentry guns in high traffic locations. sentry guns can last for two rounds if you pick them up between rounds, as this stops 1 minute countdown they have before exploding. this method becomes more effective the higher into the rounds you go as there will be more enemies to maintain a 9x multiplier. note: on round 14 there will always 70+ enemies.

it took me a little over an hour a gun from level 8 to 34. it�s not super fun, but this is the most effective method i found. regardless, i hope you guys have a good day.

0 coefficient doesn't scale your cursor velocity up or down, so your flicks for every optic feel the same, its just based off the 2d distance from your reticle to your target. for example, if you were standing say 20 meters back from two targets and you aim in with a 1x sight and flick between them, youll have to move your mouse 1 inch for each flick (just arbitrary numbers for the example) if you moved 40 meters back from those same targets, then aimed in with a 2x zoom scope, youll have to move your mouse 1 inch again, so its as if you physically moved 2 times closer to the target and had a 1x optic. if you went back to being 20 meters away, then aimed with the 2x, youll then have to move your mouse 2 inches for the flick, because its like your standing standing really close to them with a 1x optic. like is said before, using a coefficient above 0 would scale your cursor velocity and sensitivity up with the new fov of the 2 times scope, so the distance and speed you have to move your mouse for a flick would be different for every fov and every sight. if you learn to judge your flicks based off the 2d distance from your reticle to your target, then using 0 will let you learn muscle memory way faster, because it doesnt matter what game, fov, or how much zoom an optic has. its all the same. once i started using it, i started to get a lot better and way more consistent. i play on a kinda medium sens, 1600 dpi 2.5 ingame, and i have a 40ish cm mousepad. one end to the other does a little over a 360",0.9404,0.003,0.95,0.046

we did it with waw, mw2,black ops, mw3, black ops 2, then stopped, and kinda also stopped having an excuse to take a break from our lives to play call of duty, that was our dumb justification. once it stopped being a bonus for advanced infinite super smash brawl warfare, we bought the remastered version of cod 4, loved it, played together again. when 2019 came around, we thought it would be fun and  bought it. it was uuuh...we mostly play co-op games now.  no way we can compete with the reflexes of people playing today, like we are all always tired and lacking proper sleep, have like 30 minutes of free time, yeah, i get it for people who are good at the game(and somehow now have laser rifles, that actually startled the first time it happened, i wasn�t expecting lasers), i liked the campaign mode for both cold war and mw 2019, and zombies are kinda fun.  but it�s too much stuff to process, i mean imagine last time you played was on monday, you do another session today, the pop up thing says new stuff that i still don�t get has been added, cool idc, wtvr, ok cool, get everyone in the lobby, pray that nobody�s game crashes, and we get wrecked immediately or the match has terrible connection, or game crashes.

i�ve checked i�m logged in to mw with my activision account and i am.

17486,"typical meta spr quickscope build is:

- sniper scope

- zlr asp barrel (short barrel)

- 338 lapua ammo

- xrk blitz stock 

- tac laser 


the scope for obvious reasons.

the short barrel for ads & movement speed buffs, unfortunately it drastically hurts the bullet velocity & 1-shot-kill damage range which is why we use the 338 ammo.

338 improves velocity & damage range lost by the barrel to effectively counter the losses. it also adds a 1-shot-kill area to the stomach within 20m or so. 

xrk blitz stock for ads & strafe, movement & sprint to fire speed buff. unfortunately it adds a lot of wobble to the idle sway. 

that�s where the tac laser comes in to negate the idle sway & further improve ads time. 

overall the gun is just faster in every way, although the fire rate is slightly slower due to the 338. 



alternatively if your aim is pretty accurate and you can reliably hit thoes upperchest and head shots, much like a good kar98 user. just drop the 338 ammo. put on the feather bolt.",-0.8555,0.145,0.767,0.087

there is a way you can see through your error history and the amount of times i have had this code in one week is silly.

dont bother watching the youtube videos saying rebuild database, initialise, delete trophy history, uninstall etc etc it's all a waste of time. i really wanted to find a fix for this and will continue to try but i genuinely believe there is nothing we can do other than hope for a patch on the updates through activison and playstation platforms.

plus, there�s simply no excuse for the tragic mishandling of mw since the release of bocw. there�s no reason why xp should be nerfed and double xp simply not work anymore.

this damages the integrity of the game and that is what i care about. i don�t care about the medial politics that come with a fan base. everyone is entitled to their own opinions about the games they play, so idgaf about it. what i care about is how much damage a company does to a game because they can�t handle the poor sales figures of their most recent product.",0.9606,0.126,0.666,0.208

shoot house (hp, hq, dom)

shipment (hp, dom)
(there was a shipment hq mode but i think they removed it)

rust (hp, dom)
(stay alway from onslaught and demolition on rust, you will learn the true definition of being spawn trapped)

khandor hideout(dom, hp)
(dom plays better on this map than hp imo)

gun runner, hackney yard, st. petrograd
(hp, dom)
(three of the better launch maps, in contradiction to khandor hideout, they play better on hp imo)

cheshire park, scrap yard, hard hat, vacant, talsik backlot, hovec sawmill, crash (hp, dom)
(i always play hp on cheshire park and vacant if it is given to me)

atlas superstore, broadcast, petrov oil rig, mialstor tank factory, suldar harbor (hp)
(hp on the costco map is super underrated, but for the rest of the big maps i think only hp can save them from being never played on by me)

tl;dr hardpoint is the game mode that can be super fun and save a somewhat okay map, especially a big map in this game. domination as a game mode comes close in 2nd.

edit: added more details. 

i speed tested my wifi on the same network from multiple devices, and they all worked fine (i.e. reported within their usual range) . this issue mainly occurred on my ps4 and on a wired connection. couldn't play for hours, so i switched to wireless mode on ps4 and it (mostly) worked fine,  but i believe that was coincidental since it was still inconsistent (and usually my wired connection is more secure and faster). 

i also have a 1gb internet connection in my home and disabled most other devices while testing this, so i'm used to seeing anywhere from 200 mbps - 500 mbps reflected in the native ps4 connection tests. in the ""fetching profile"" case,  i saw lower hundreds of kbps. way slower despite other devices on the network operating at high download speeds.

it's very possible my ethernet port on the ps4 is messed up (i tested that ethernet cable separately), but i doubt that too. especially since it worked fine today after a few tries, but was smooth sailing after the connection was made and matches showed no lag and 30-40 ping. i disconnected and reconnected a few times after that as well, and still experienced the fetching profile issue once or twice. 

tl;dr: after some fairly thorough troubleshooting, i really think these issues are related to bugs in the latest software update and would suggest waiting for a fix (which may or may not happen soon).",-0.5829,0.062,0.882,0.056

edit: just noticed that you are also asking for ar attachments, particularly lightweight ar�s. my philosophy in building these guns, such as the m13, ram, m4, kilo and grau, is to �beat them to the gun�, or kit them for mobility in a more general term, particularly stacking 5mw with stippled grip tape for fastest sprint to fire. i usually take a commando foregrip next bc it doesn�t slow down my ads and it reduces side to side recoil bounce. the last two attachments is up to you, i usually take an optic and a muzzle device (brake/comp). extended mag is a good choice too and you could also consider the stock that reduce your ads speed or increase your ads movement speed. good luck again.",0.9922,0.014,0.772,0.213

furthermore, i don't think you understand what ""exploiting"" the game means. exploiting is using a programming glitch to give yourself an unfair advantage (e.g. - clipping into buildings, getting outside or under the map). simply using the game assets within the intended normal use, is not ""exploiting"" the game or cheating by any means. holding a power position by camping can control flow of movement on the map and potentially give your team a tactical advantage, and can be a legitimate means of playing the game. 

is camping annoying, hell yes. but it's not cheating or exploiting by any means. 

you need to change how you approach the problem. players who truly camp give their position away. watch the kill cam - you'll see their perspective and you know where they are. with the knowledge of where they are you can avoid their line of fire, and if you are seeking revenge you can find a way to get behind them and take them out.",-0.995,0.268,0.664,0.067

as for team balance i do think it tries to put good players with worse players, but i'm not entirely sure. this is how team balance worked in older cods at least. if i'm being honest i don't take w/l too seriously on tdm and domination, because those modes you can't carry as one guy. no matter how well you do, having 1 or 2 bot-tier teammates can ensure a loss. 

i only care about w/l on ffa, hardpoint and hq. on those modes it is actually possible to solo carry because of how the modes work. for tdm i just play to do well myself and ignore if we actually win or not. if i go positive and get 25+ kills then it's a win in my books, regardless of whether it's actually a win haha",0.9726,0.128,0.661,0.211

i got my friend- who normally just plays single player games like red dead, gta, assassins creed he has never played a cod game- to try out modern warfare around a year ago and we�re still banging this game out all day, grinding for camos and competing in competitive game modes. let me tell you why this game is fantastic, and more than just your typical call of duty game

1. the campaign is pretty cool, you get some great moments like piccadilly, clean house and the siege at the end. this is all brought to you with a real, gritty and realistic way that hasn�t been seen in mainstream fps games for years.

2. custom games. i don�t know if this is just something for me, but even when it does get boring grinding and playing on multiplayer online, custom games is the offline alternative that lets you mess around to make crazy and bizarre scenarios and modes, like knives only, zombies, mini battle royale, or even mil-sim tactical realism. it�s amazing and i�m still experimenting with custom game modes to this day!

3. the multiplayer
there is a ridiculous amount of things you can do it in multiplayer, for example- 
- grinding your guns for gold, silver, damascus or obsidian camos
- playing competitive game modes like search and destroy, gunfight tournaments and cyber attack
-messing around with friends
-playing casually
basically, the list goes on.

in conclusion, modern warfare is definitely the most worthwhile game i�ve bought since halo 3 so many years ago. it�s amazing, i�ll still be playing it for years to come due to its offline capabilities, and me and my friend both can agree that cold war was disappointing and a big step backwards for call of duty. it was not worth the purchase, even though i got it for sale for �33 i still thought it was a rip off compared to this game.",0.9204,0.133,0.688,0.179

as someone who primarily snipes and goes for clips, i can tell you that playing in higher skill level lobbies is paradoxically better that low skill because players follow predictable play patterns in their movement and class choices; i know what to expect, i build my classes accordingly, and i move through the map expecting players to be posted at the usual spots using the usual meta weapons. maybe it's just me, but i encounter more cheese classes in casual games.

it's also worth mentioning that unlike previous mw titles, snipers are pretty underpowered in this one (aside from the marksman rifles), and you're really rewarded for picking map / game-mode specific classes. i always run a sub as my secondary in search for this reason, trying to get past the ""resorting to a machine gun is too easy"" mentality.",0.9833,0.046,0.771,0.182

take breaks every so often and run a different load out as it keeps you from burning out.  when you get the gold it will be worth it.  most my camouflage came from regular playing, but the skulls was the hardest with my shield.

same with the spr. shit can one hit from the waist up, and can ads fast as fuck. without a scope, 290 ms, and with one, up to 340. my kilo, with prowler, mono, tac, stippled and 50 rounds will ads in 307ms. obviously my kilo is on the slow side and meant for low recoil, but unless i�m using 100 rounds, why the fuck should an iron sights sniper be faster than an iron sights ar? 

even if you spec out the kilo, or anything that�s not the fal or famas for full ads time, you add in the ttk of hitting your shots, and it will always lose to the spr at any range.

they dropped those 2 guns on us and just dipped. leaving us with this annoying garbage.

edit: guys, i�m not saying you�re gonna go 100 and 0 with an spr. something can over-perform, or be op and not get a lot of kills. the numbers i provided show that. it over performs in cqb. i don�t think it takes a cod pro to take advantage of that either. you don�t need shroud aim, the hit box is pretty big.

edit:2 as you can see, i�m on pc. aiming with a sniper is literally as easy as aiming an smg for me. there�s no removal of aim assist as a nerf for me. so take that into consideration. even then, i played controller for a long time, and don�t really recall sniping in mw2 or bo2 being that hard.",-0.9391,0.092,0.863,0.045

i'm a pc m&k player, my overall kd is 1.90. with the as val, i was able to achieve 2.75-3.0kd on that weapon. for comparison, i consider myself fairly skilled with the fal, which is my second best gun, around a 2.15kd. i think even the fal is overpowered and should never have been buffed. but that goes to show the ridiculousness of the val.

the fact they give you any points after you die is actually a big deal on maps like promenade because it means if you get a streak like white phos or gunship, you can suicide and get enough kills in the next life to get a pred, which can lead to another vtol and then to another white phos or gunship and then loop them infinitely.",-0.9875,0.231,0.728,0.042

uzi: 41. ae, carbine pro barrel, stippled, soh, your choice. 41ae is a must have on the uzi, otherwise it's underperforming. really good with .41 ae.

i can also really recommend the pkm. snatch grip is a must, set it up for ads speed with a holosight on top and you're golden. i usually leave the barrel alone to keep some range and use a tac laser, but that's up to you.",0.9679,0.06,0.742,0.198

�it�s a debate bw core vs hardcore players. basically it boils dow to ttk meaning it�s much harder to kill someone in core versus hc. yet it�s much easier to die in hc. i myself really like hc. it makes you super keen on aim and instincts. you learn the maps much better (no mini maps unless you�ve got a uav). much easier to flush out campers and i find the pace faster. plus killstreaks are way more prevelant. also a great way to grind camos.�

so the only thing i can suggest is wait mate. i think activision have a system set up where it detects un-authorised activity and locks it down. if you haven�t done anything wrong you should be fine as it goes through review.

i still can�t remove the rouge account but it hasn�t been a problem as the password change and 2fa make it difficult for them to use it again.

mw19 local multiplayer is pretty fun if you ask me (you have a bit more custom game options than ghosts, and the class customization focuses mostly on the new gunsmith system which i prefer over the old system. the maps are also less cancer when play), even if i had to use my little brother as a substitute for my friend when i played it.",0.8805,0.053,0.802,0.145

hello,  i'm a battlefieldv player who has had enought of the hackfest bf5 has  become lately with all servers infested with hackers, making the game  unplayable. so i'm considering changing games. i know cod unlike bf5 in  many ways considering its an arcade type fps, so thats a drawback for  me, but i've heard there is a mode in modernwarfare, ground wars that  ends up being very similar to bf type of gameplay. what can you guys  tell me about it? are the servers populated, is it a dead game mode? how  about cheaters? i'm considered other games like tarkov, insurgency  sandstorm, or squad2. but they are wither dead, full of cheaters of  outdated im graphics.

* core gives you plenty of time to react but you have to keep your aim on target, first shot accuracy is not important as you have time to correct. core is overall more friendly towards player. but weapon balance only revolves around m4, mp5, r9-0, val, spr and it boring at times. but at least i acknowledge that it�s more fun for the majority of player as people hate dying to one shot weapon and everything is one shot in hc, maybe because people like you see it as unfair �hey i didn�t even have the time to shoot him, broken ass game� when in reality you got out-sped by miles.

* hardcore doesn�t give you enough time to react but it gives you the damage a real bullet would deal to an infranty soldier. imma have to debunk you here, my accuracy actually improves with hc. since you have such a short window of time to react to an enemy in a 1 on 1 situation, you have to hit those shots accurately or you will die. that is taking in spint-to-fire time, the time it takes for you to correctly point your crosshair at the enemy, ads time, your mouse response rate and latency compare to your monitor,... and weapon choice and customization is better, i�d argue that gunsmith is made for hc because every weapon and every build can work well. my ar doesn�t have to look and play like an smg anymore with those no stock yet i can still shit on people. good luck beating an m4 with the scar in core.

i�m pretty sure your friend is just trash and the only hc game you ever played on was shipment to have that kind of notion about hc. it�s just the freaking 30hp, the mini-map and no hud. i�m no camper but you got killed by campers because you play it like you play core. you play it like you have 100hp, running around like head-less chickens, jumping and dropshotting like idiots and name-calling anyone who kill you whenever they carefully peak a corner and burst you balls. it�s not about camping, it�s about playing it medithodically. if you can�t handle it, then back out for core maybe? i bet you don�t even have a a good reason to bash hc other than �oh 2oo m4ny c4mp3rs�",-0.9316,0.178,0.659,0.163

**mw3:** very solid game. acr suppressor was a bit over used for the whole time, but i enjoyed every aspect of this game. **rating: 8.9**

**bo2:** i didn't own this game, but i played it a lot with my friends. loved the zombies. **rating: 8.5**

bo1: in my opinion, the most well rounded experience. zombies was at its best, the campaign was excellent, and mp was good. 10/10

mw3: a more subdued mw2. one of my favourite mp experiences. more reasonable weapon balancing, the introduction of specialist. campaign was ok, spec ops wasn�t as good as mw2. 8/10

bo2: the best mp, without a doubt. the gold standard. campaign and zombies were ok. the mp keeps it at 9/10.

ghosts: at this point i stopped playing campaigns. so mp only. at this point in time, the worst mp at launch. got significantly better with dlc. 6/10 overall.

aw: intro of p2w guns. overall guns and maps felt meh. i feel like on pc, this game would have been more fun, but advanced movement did not feel good to me on controller. 4/10

bo3: i lied, beat this campaign on realistic for the calling cards. it sucked. didn�t play zombies. mp was overall pretty fun, movement felt more refined. specialists were a novel idea, albeit annoying at times.  7/10

infinite warfare: didn�t play

ww2: lacklustre mp at launch, very few maps. got better with division overhaul and tons of dlc guns. 6/10

bo4: really great at the start. game was fluid and fast paced. specialists were really cancer. game slowly devolved into garbage as they added more annoying dlc guns. 7.5/10

mw 2019: the absolute worst 6v6 experience in cod period. overall level of detail is good. movement is fun. guns feel nice. maps blow. 5.5/10

cold war: zombies is okay so far. doa3 really steals the show for me. mp is the most unfun thing i�ve played so far. for pc, mouse input feels poor. crossplay balancing is 50 steps backwards from mw. guns don�t feel as solid as mw.  game also just likes to crash. 3/10. i would rather play advanced warfare.",0.9816,0.132,0.651,0.217

in most fields the mw guns are better than the cw guns. most of the cw guns attachments dont even work correctly.
those 3 guns are more or less the only ones that stuck out from the rest of the lackluster cw guns.
the best ar in the game is still the amax which is a mw gun. 
the most used sniper rifles are still the kar98 and the hdr.
sure the mac10 took the #1 smg spot but so what? people were tired of using the same guns all the time, but there are still mw smgs that are very good.

that is a generic description used for any operators in the game. it does not necessarily mean there's always buyable skins for every operator in the game, it more or less applies to the fact that:

a. base game operators (which have specific unlock challenges) can all be unlocked just by buying/unlocking other skins.

b. operators introduced via seasonal battle passes are also unlockable via any skins you acquire, though their ""base"" skins (as in their first skin sets) will not be made available.

in regards to your case, price and farah are so far exclusive to the s4 and s6 battle passes (which you have missed obviously). based on datamined info, it is possible that activision will introduce buyable bundles for people who missed out on these past battle passes at some point, but we don't know when.",-0.6382,0.054,0.937,0.009

obviously, this is a really short-sighted move. i think activision will be surprised at how many people decide to skip the next cod installment and just move to battlefield instead. that's certainly my plan. but what else can you expect from a large company whose decision-making process is entirely governed by a handful of shareholders whose only objective is maximising revenue in the next quarter?",0.5859,0.079,0.815,0.106

when they're not on sale, *advanced warfare* is the newest one that's less than the full launch price on steam, and even then, it's still not cheap. it's $65 cad vs $80 cad. you have to go all the way back to *mw2* and earlier to find any that are less than $40 cad, and even the oldest ones are still $22 cad

here's their current standard prices in cad, not including dlc (all the games on steam are on sale for the next couple days though, so if you want to pick any up, now's probably the best time to do it):

(i speak of these games as they are what i have the most experience with)

the issue here feels like modern warfare 2019, now called warzone, is being forced into obsolescence, with the intent of ""upgrading"".

on pc, this started off as the advertisement for cold war being larger than the portion of the window for the game that people purchased. personally, i thought this was in bad taste, seeing how there was no lacking information regarding the upcoming release of cold war, but whatever.

next, the in game advertisements because a large portion of what was seen. this was annoying, and i personally felt it was pretty crappy of them, but whatever.

that is followed up by the name of the game being changed, and 1/3 of the main menu is taken up by a game that is unplayable. during this period, the battle pass season goes from what would have been 7 to season 1, and the content in this battle pass isn't even for the game in which people purchased it from... while i am not a lawyer, this would fit under my definition of fraud and accepting money under false pretenses.

if the previous stuff wasn't enough, this game suddenly gets an update which more or less removes the ability to unlock items in this game, and match making has started to feel as if it's been manipulated to the point of frustrating the player base into ""upgrading"".

it's started to feel like going throw a bad break up with a desperate ex. what's next? is there going to  be threats that if we don't buy their new ""upgrade"", they will sell our personal information and/or use any personal information on our accounts to make the transaction for us? this has gone beyond petty marketing and bad business practices.",-0.9915,0.158,0.794,0.047
21183,"thing is, some of what you've listed is a problem in a cold war as well though.

- 2/3 of the main menu are for a completely seperate game (let's not forget mw and warzone are the same game.) so it feels like they're trying to get you to play anything that isn't what you've chosen, regardless of what you've chosen.

- the matchmaking in cold war is almost exactly the same as modern warfare, if not worse to the point where it stops you wanting to play.

the problem with any legal issues they might have had with the battle pass is that they can say ""it does work for modern warfare"" and in one way, it does. most if not all the content works in warzone which is part of modern warfare. not to mention them rebranding mw as warzone.

the main difference between what they're doing now and what they used to do, is they essentially forced their own hand. by attaching warzone to modern warfare in such a core embedded way, they've made it extremely difficult for themselves. if modern warfare and warzone were seperate, my guess is they would've left mw like they traditionally do but since they can't update warzone without updating mw they've shot themselves in the foot.

they've bitten off far more than they can chew and it's only going to get worse as more games release. 

what are they gonna do when they release a new game with new weapons and operators? add more into warzone? further breaking the fragile weapon balance that currently exists or are they gonna start removing stuff, which will cause them more hassle due to people having bought stuff like cosmetics and blueprints. 

their focus on warzone is likely gonna be what loses call of duty a lot of their playerbase",-0.8558,0.103,0.829,0.068

that it is too good.

i could keep playing mw2019 for years, everything,from all the work they put:

\- in the new engine (go ahead and compare cod ghosts with this,) , 

\-the animations, the feel when walking, running, sprinting, sliding, reloading

\-the sound design (yeah footsteps suck sometime but still) ,

\- the exact amount of nostalgia with old maps like rust, vacant, shipment, you all got goosebumps loading a match in these maps for the first time in years, no other modern cod gave you chills like this, fuck outta here with nuketown or raid from black ops.

\-the campaign, while not groundbreaking, was exciting and great globetrotting fun with the man himself, captain price.

\-i think there's a difference between being a hater, and wanting to be a hater, and the internet just wanted to hate mw2019 for so long, that's why everyone bitches about nonsense, that's why it attracts assholes who cheat in multiplayer, because everyone wants a piece of it, but they can't bring it down, it's too good.

\-so the only entity that can truly fuck them over is activision, because they own the thing, no one in there has the balls to stop making a new game just for a year, so this great experience that is mw2019 can breathe and truly reach it's potential. they're too greedy too much enslaved to shareholders, so treyarch had to step in the middle of the development of cod 2020 and shit out this clearly inferior experience because it wasn't looking good to begin with.

\-i bet the top dogs at infinity ward are looking at this entire shit show with a smile, no because of how activision has butchered their baby, but because they know they're the fucking best, these guys created cod they know what works and what it needs. i wish i could buy them and let them do whatever the fuck they wanted.

and the movement well, its cool to slide around n shit but the sprint to fire speed is so retarded slow that you literally can't rush around the map with all the mobility you got properly because anytime a camper sees you you will die. even if you see him just as quick because he didn't sprint, he starts firing first and he will win the fight. in older cods i felt far more capable in dealing with campers and sweaty ass players with just pure aim and reaction time and still did fairly well in a game full of sweaters and campers. in this game, i feel unable to deal even with console player campers lol as a fricking pc player. if the lobby is sweaty i go 0.3 kda lol

no. it isn't. maybe you can call it campy at times, but if you know how to shoot a gun you just need to pick up the worst first weapon or in some cases the pistol is good enough to get the first kill and a better starter weapon. after that you have to get 10k and you can get your personal loadout and from there, go at the finish line.

you can also choose where to drop: into a mid map zone full of people or into an empty land without them, so i don't get the complaints

21519,i just edited my post and meant to put warzone rumble,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
21520,"actually i find out that going in solo and doing supply run is actually better for several reason :

\- people tend do camp more and not shoot at random vehicles passing by                          
\- you don't actually need to exit the vehicle to finish the contract, so get a trophy with thebig one and you are super safe                                                                                                 
\- this is the main one, you get 20% more exp bonus each contract you do.

without boring you with math, here's a quick example : 10 supply run in plunder vs br.every supply run is 500x2 weapon exp considering double exp token.well in plunder it's 10k, in br i'ts 19k. and 10 is a below-avarage number, even in br, if you play for contract only. if we go up to 15, the difference become way bigger, being 15k vs 36k, more then double exp.

beside that, going for this playstyle in br gave me a lot of top 10 placement, and a couple of wins, (low kills win, but still win).                                                                       another upside is that in br, after the supply runs out, you can get one last bounty contract, and if you manage to kill the target  after 10+ contract, you will get an insane amount of exp, i did like from 41, to 44 only with that final boosted bounty kill on the ffar.

it actually has one major downside, that of course is the fact that you do not spawn with your loadout. that's why it is better for lvl up ground weapons so you don't have to waste the time getting money for loadout, but even for other weapons it could be done starting off with a scavenger into loadout, it may be delayed a bit, but it's still doable and worth.",-0.6686,0.101,0.788,0.112

21620,"i bought it a few weeks ago and has really been enjoying it. the campaign is in my opinion a truly great single player experience with some of the most action packed, breathtaking scenery and heartbreaking moments i had in a game for a long time. 

co-op is also also a great experience. there are a total of about 8 different missions excluding survival and classic special operations which feature even more missions that i haven�t done yet. 

the multiplayer is really good when it works (last week has been pretty rough, but the week before it was a blast) and when matchmaking works you get some pretty good fights. i personally really like almost all the maps. a lot of the maps kind of force you to play a bit slower and check all angles before rushing in, which i personally really like. this is kind of controversial as cod usually features extremely simple map designs (three lane setups) without many dark corners or rooms to camp in. if you like the more tactical approach, flash bang a room before moving in, slowly checking all angles and generally moving around the map a bit slower i think you will enjoy multiplayer. 

all in all i would recommend the game to everyone, even though it is kind of broken as of writing this. the movement, animations, setting, gunplay and design are all really superb, but if i were you i would maybe wait until we get an update that fixes the no xp bug in multiplayer, or just play single player and co op until they patch it.",0.9922,0.052,0.746,0.202

i just want an answer a proper fix from your end, and not "" have you tried scan and repair? or have you tried reinstalling? "" yes i have multiple times. and everytime i maybe get a game or 2 in and then insert random disc read error since they always seem to be different. its bad enough there are dev errors but those i have been able to get under control with fixes from others.

i'm 100% not switching to playing cold war full time tho, while the campaign and zombies are fun from what i've played, and raid crossroads express and nuke town are fun, the rest of multiplayer is garbage, the movement is sluggish compared to modern warfare, the guns look poorly designed compared to modern warfare, diamond camo looks shit, gold looks like they just used a fill tool on the gun, dmu and dark rather look cool, i will give them that.
overall i wouldnt recommend switching to cold war unless you would consistently play with friends there but its fucking awful that theyd stop weapon progression in modern warfare to push us to cold war

this isn't the first time they're throwing a cod game away for the next one and it won't be the last. people gotta stop having faith with a company that doesn't care about them. it's a yearly series they don't care about this game anymore. cod 2021 is being made right now.",-0.7211,0.12,0.814,0.067

22457,"i've basically put at least 30 days play time into every cod since mw1 so i think i have a little historical perspective, and i'm with you completely.

yes, the map design in this game is really poor, but the spawns, since day one, have been like something out of pre-release version. in all the cods previous to this one (with a handful of exceptions that were patched quickly, like the shooting through the crate spawnkill on wwii and the revenge spawn problem in mw3) i could probably count on one hand the number of times an enemy spawned in a location that i had line of sight to. now it's basically the norm, and it should *never* happen.

one of the fundamental elements of cod was the tactics of ""pushing the spawns,"" like in domination you'd take only two of the flags on purpose, so you could kind of encircle the third flag and pick off guys as they came out of their end. now that kind of tactical play is almost impossible, because you have guys from the other team constantly spawning within spitting distance of your own end, often just far enough out of eyesight that they can shoot you in the side of the head.

one of the posts i've seen more times in this sub than any other is people complaining ""why don't people play the objective in objective modes?"" and i strongly believe it's because of the spawn problem. sure in objective modes you'll have a percentage of players that will always try and play the objective, but for that ""swing vote"" in the middle (of which i'm certainly one) it seems pointless for the most part in this game, because the spawns themselves have no respect for the concept of playing tactically - why am i going to hold a flag in domination, or a headquarters, or whatever, when the enemy team can spawn in a position to the side of, or behind me, where they can kill me before i even know they're there?

this seems like an entirely fixable problem - i mentioned the mw3 ""revenge spawns"" earlier, and that was an issue that persisted for barely a week or two, back in the glory days of mw3 when robert bowling (fourtwozero) was iw's community liason - occasionally in ffa modes, if you killed someone, they'd respawn somewhere behind you on the map, so just by running forward, they could find and kill you. one single update and the problem was remedied. i have to believe that the spawns in this game are the way they are because either iw or activision want them that way - perhaps they have some kind of advanced metrics on the playerbase that tells them that despite all the anger and complaints, the way they're doing it now is either causing players to play more, or somehow spend more money.",-0.9313,0.124,0.764,0.112

now, this might be an unpopular opinion, but i think extending the play area to make larger maps would potentially help with spawning. the smaller maps like shipment and rust are  a complete joke in regards to spawns and shoothouse is often rife with spawn killing.",-0.4019,0.135,0.743,0.122

22545,"jeez, these are legitimately the worst replies that i have ever seen about mouse sensitivity. ever. holy fuck. i'm not a 2.5 k/d player but i have to intervene before these morons confuse you.

your overall sensitivity is determined by two things: mouse dpi, and in-game sensitivity. your 'edpi' (i.e. effective dpi) is your mouse dpi multiplied by your in-game sens. so with an in-game of 5 and a dpi of 800, your edpi would be 4000. that would be the same 360 distance as 1600dpi and 2.5 in-game sens, however, with 1600 dpi you would technically have more fine control because each inch of mouse movement is divided into 1600 parts instead of 800. functionally, any dpi over 400 is fine and you probably won't be able to feel a difference. 400 is popular among older cs players and 800 is more common for people who didn't start with cs.

windows sensitivity is not relevant. don't let people lie to you about this.

generally speaking, high sensitivity is a disadvantage in pc shooters. yes, you read that right. i don't know what fucking drugs people are taking on this subreddit that made them think higher sensitivity is better for mouse players. the lower your sensitivity is, the more control you have. if you have to move your mouse .000124 inches to hit the head, it's going to be really hard. if you can move it anywhere between .5 and .6 inches and still be on the haed, it's going to be a lot easier. as long as you can turn around in a single swipe, turning will take essentially the same amount of time. the travel time of your mouse is generally negligible.

generally speaking, the advice that people give is to use the lowest sensitivity that you can handle. for many people, that means making it so moving your mouse from the center of the pad to the edge of the pad results in a 180 degree turn in hipfire. this means that you can always turn and fight somebody who shoots you from behind with a single swipe of your mouse. most people have limited mousepad space, so this method works well for them. if you have a nice huge mousepad, you just want to set it to whatever constitutes a comfortable single swipe 180.

most players will have a ads sens modifier that 'equals' their hipfire. what feels 'identical' between hipfire and zoomed fire is actually somewhat complicated but the short version is that the 'screen distance' should feel constant between hipfire and scoped fire. 

you don't actually have to make them equal, but that's the most common choice. if you want to be able to spin around quickly but then slow down and be really accurate while scoped, it's a viable strategy. a lot of r6 players and pros use a lower ads sensitivity because you ads 99.99% of the time when fighting in r6. your hipfire doesn't need to be particularly precise so you can live with a relatively high hipfire for quickly checking rooms. 

warzone is kind of weird because there is some hipfire and a lot of high mobility turning and jumping and shit, but also a lot of long range tracking. ads times are also really slow so you can't necessarily scope-unscope every time you need to turn 15 degrees. idk, i prefer having them match so that things always feel equal whether i'm playing r6, warzone, overwatch or even a singleplayer game. 

so overall... meh. it's not necessary to play a low sensitivity, but it's usually better to do so. 2000 edpi is probably the lower bound for what is sane for hipfire. below that it's just too much work to turn around and loot relative to how people move. somewhere around 16000 edpi is probably the upper bound for what is sane. realistically though, unless you're fairly restricted for space there's very little reason to play above 6000 edpi. i think 4000 is a good starting point. with your 50% ads though, maybe try 6000 edpi for hipfire so that your scoped shots aren't super slow.",-0.9116,0.093,0.834,0.072

22558,"i may be in the minority, but i don't think the remaining multiplayer maps are that bad; the bigger problem is spawn logic. my go-to modes have always been headquarters, hardpoint, and domination, and the first two are decent in mw with spawns generally behaving as one might expect (hq/hardpoint located between two spawns). in domination however, it seems that spawns are always polar between sides of the map, such that spawning with a control is the same as spawning with ab control, no matter the size of the map or positioning of the enemy team. sure, if the whole enemy team is encroaching on b, that makes sense. but on larger maps, there's no reason for spawning in initial spawn if your team has map control. it interrupts the flow of games and deters spawn trapping, which is great for less experienced players but really annoying for veterans of the series. not only that, it seems that when iw updated dom to make spawns less sticky, they completely reversed it such that spawn flips happen way too easily. doing laps around the map while avoiding head glitchers and bush wookies feels more like battlefield than cod, but with faster ttk and better hiding spots. 

&#x200b;

early on, playing multiplayer was almost unbearable because of map complexity and players reluctance to move around. now that the game has some mileage and with sbmm, a lot of players in my lobbies are using this hybrid style of aggressive movement and good positioning. as someone who doesn't like jetpack cod, this reminds me a lot of the previous mw titles... you can play aggressively, but it requires a lot of map knowledge and really good fundamental gun and movement skill. if it were just mounting on sightlines, or if were just twitchy slide cancelling, camera-ing, jump/drop shotting, i wouldn't like it... it's the combination of the two that makes multiplayer worth it, and most of the maps are well designed to accommodate both of those playstyles.

mw is done, it's unfortunate but i don't believe any game has ever had a large content drop after the release of the next one. warzone is going to be the exception, raven is likely working on the anniversary update. 

it's only different this year because warzone is still attached to mw. if they had the resources, they'd probably seperate warzone but since warzone is so embedded into the core of mw (system, asset and coding wise) it's probably more hassle than it's worth at the moment. so mw is being dragged along for the ride",0.4678,0.048,0.88,0.072

snipers generally seemed a bit useless on anything except ground war or wz. the kinds of ranges you typically engage at in mp are best suited to smg and ars. also, because the respawn times in cod are so quick, trying to camp in one spot tends to earn you a swift death most of the time.

at close range, i found the ads to be painfully slow. most of the time, if an enemy came round the corner, the ttk on their gun was quick enough to melt me before i could even finish the ads animation.

kills i dont focus on ever

headshots if i catch someone in a ""finishing move"" style situation (they havent seen me) i will try to get headshots done, but they tend to come from normal playing or hipfire mostly

crouches are easy, never have to focus on them 

hipfire kills are really easy in hardcore, i normally run merc foregrips on my builds anyway so i will just put a 5wm laser on instead of a scope if im rly struggling

longshots i said about earlier

mounted are a chore, i have to force myself to do them, but if i see a line of sight with people nearby i will mount up and get them, but i tend to get like 1/2 a game so it takes a while to get them

kills with 5 attatchments is easy

double kills are mostly chance

kills after reloading are easy, i tend to run sleight of hand on non snipers anyway so they come fairly easily

kills with no attatchment i start to do after i finish with 5 attatchments and they just sorta happen

3 player killstreaks just sorta happen too, but due to it being unlocked at max level i normally finish it last",-0.9186,0.136,0.751,0.112

23696,"nice! finally took months before someone said anything about it.

ever since normal infected came out with care package drops, i've been using this glitch for wasting time. 

anyways, how this glitch work and stuff...

moderate - hard to pull it off (rng on allies, enemy players, killstreaks) 

you have to be alive.
you need an killstreak drop from care packages that drop time to time. one of these would work.

- predator missile
- wheelson 
- chopper gunner 
- ac-130 

next! 
early in the match, i recommend you to stay alive until there are only 5-8 or less players alive, because you will spawn near or right next to them (not in a zombie model but your own personal human model). 

next!!
you need an enemy player that straight up kills you while you use said killstreak. no assassination. 
you have to time it right .5 seconds to hit it off.
right before you enter the killstreak state, you have to activate the killstreak and be killed. 

next!!! 
you will be spawned on the zombie side, but with your former human allies and you do not look like an zombie, just an enemy human with a red name. 

you cannot harm humans by shooting them or knifing/melee. 
you can kill humans by shooting their atv, claymores, ammo box. 
you can kill your friendly zombies up to 3 times.
however, if you kill 3 zombies, you will be killed for 1 minute for friendly fire. and then the glitch is over, you become a regular infected. 
you cannot get anymore ammo, claymore, stun grenades. 

whats the purpose of all this? 
for griefing or trolling everyone. 

you can troll enemy humans by shooting them, distracting them for a bit while your infected allies kill them. destroy their temporary barrier by shooting it. 
annoying atvs? hop on and chase them down, shoot theirs as your allies swarm them as it breaks down. 

you can use your single stun grenade to stun the humans (useful in their last stand position, normal infected lobbies) 

you can super troll your infected allies, shoot them to get attention (you can kill them) as they helplessly attack you for no damage and get pissed off lol
just remember to not kill more than 2, otherwise the you will be killed for team killing for 1 minute. 

the only things i wasn't been able to find out was...

the claymore doesn't work on enemy humans once the glitch is activated? it can kill, if you shoot it yourself. i can't find out if it triggers. (i died too much before it can happen) 

when you have a rocket launcher as a secondary, i couldn't find out if you can kill human players as a infected using rockets. 

like i said earlier, rng factors in the match.

you had to have good allies to stay alive until you get care packages and have the match losing
need to get the right killstreaks.
you need enemy players to come up to you to knife you instead of assassination or throwing knife, which throws off the timing of the glitch. 

can't test it out anymore because last month, my nephews were touching my ps4 and after work for 5 hours? came home to find the ps4 in safe mode...
had to reboot it clean, lost everything.
and encounter the infamous copy add-on disc, which i couldnt solve after 1 week of frustration. 

have to download the game (free warzone) or buy the dang game again full price. 

oh.
if you tried this on groundwar, you will simply instantaneous respawn at your base but you lost the kill streak. 

haven't tested on other game modes though, such as s&d, etc. but i guess it won't affect it much at all or nothing.",-0.9996,0.282,0.65,0.068

u need help with any of the weapons i can, jokr is best done on shipment, stand on c flag and shoot over to a, you will get all 4 kill challenges done if you have amped equipped, cuavs, pradars and vtols are the best for challenges, i got the ax-50 gold on sunday, i mostly used either mono supressor, 7 round mags or the tac laser, ads stock, variable zoom scope and flinch resistance or short barrel, ads stock vz scope flinch resistance and the tac laser if i was on a smaller map so i could ads fast enough.
out of those ive done the jokr rpg pkm ax-50 and from the pkm i can give you tips for the other lmgs if you want",0.6808,0.093,0.771,0.137

are there any other attatchments you would recomend for it

ars are on my list to do but most of them need leveling, as i dont have any of them max level currently, whereas i do have a couple of smgs max level so i'm currently trying for those until the xp glitch is gone, then i'm probably gonna finish them anyway, then do snipers appart from one kill for reptile on the kar so i can get a trick shot for damascus, then i'm probably get ars done, then finish lmgs because that will be a breeze then work on my trickshotting skills with a perk or something for the kar, then when i'm comfortable take the perk off and trick shot my way into damascus.

however i'm also trying to max out my riot shield at the same time. i have gold and i really want obsidian + the obsidian emblem and the obsidian calling card and maybe the damascus one too but that's gonna be a lot of pain as i'm currently at 368 of the 750 kills i need for obsidian so that's going to be a struggle to get. either way thank you for ur reply, i will give core a better chance for grinding",-0.7815,0.096,0.821,0.083

you shouldn�t be asking people who have already bought to stop playing, i got bamboozled, you got bamboozled, everyone got bamboozled into buying this game expecting it to change the franchise. it�s up to us to spread the words to the people (esp. children) who are looking to buy an fps game to stay the fuck away from anything call of duty and activision. the more we do it, the more it hurts them. stop playing won�t do crap, i�m convinced that the majority (like 99%) of cod players are a bunch of morons. buy - play - complain repeat, buy - play - complain repeat. the money keep coming and it�s still us getting the shittiest end of the stick. 

warzone need to fuck off too, this game has been so such a rollercoaster ride of hell ever since warzone exists. like i can go on but everyone knows this already. basically the whole gaming community hyping an 2017 dead trend. warzone is just another pubg on its way to its grave because of all this cheating going on and they ban people not base on evidence but on stats. yeah that worked really well with battlefield 5, yeah, totally cheater-free, totally legit banning people who are legit and have invested in cod points, the greatest part is most of them never got their account back. what a fucking joke of a company, does ea still receive the golden turd this year? they should pass it on.",-0.994,0.21,0.668,0.123

24502,"what gamemode(s) are you playing?

i mostly stick to free-for-all these days as it's the most efficient for grinding obsid, and a typical rotation for me is more like hackney, hovec, shoot house, khandor, gun runner, hovec, hovec, rust, hovec, gun runner, hovec, hovec, hovec, hovec, khandor, hovec, hackney, hovec, hovec, hovec, then hovec. 

although to be fair i think they fixed the issue that was causing hovec to come up so frequently � for the past little while it's been a really good mix of different maps with hovec coming up no more than any other. 

main point being all the maps in the ffa rotation seem to be an appropriate size, and with everyone on the map being an enemy i find enemy encounters are more frequent than in pretty much all of the team-based modes (except maybe ground war and shippy24/7).

every now and then picc comes up and i have to back out before the match starts, but i find i have fewer back-outs in ffa than in any other mode.",-0.3528,0.077,0.86,0.063

s-tier: as val, fal, spr, kar, 680, 725

a-tier: aug, mp5, cr-56, ram, m4, r9-0, vlk, jak-12, origin, ax50, hdr, mk2

b-tier: mp7, uzi, kilo, bizon, p90, fennec, sks

c-tier: ak47, scar, grau, bruen, fr 5.56, oden, sa87, ebr, dragunov, finn, rytex, striker, holger, pkm

d-tier: m13, m34, an94, iso, crossbow

literal trash: m91

the way i ranked them: 
s tier = overpowered and needs a nerf
a tier = the best weapons in the game that aren't op. usually balanced against eachother
b tier = they are good, but they are missing something to push them over the edge
c tier = these guns can still hold their own, but have significant flaws that limit the viable playstyles. generally not highly competitive.
d tier = significant flaws define the gun more so than their respective strengths. they are basically the worst
literal trash: the tier for the single worst gun in the game. it has nothing. mediocre fire rate, bad damage, extremely slow, there is absolutely nothing that makes this gun good at anything. why does it even exist

some places are slightly debatable. for example the an-94 has insane killing potential if you hit all chest and the hyperburst, but i'd still say the inconsistency and overreliance on it makes it bad.

i read some of your comments and you said you prefer ars and smgs? let me tell you some quick words about the top choices for the top picks:

as val / fal: please don't, they are a nuisance

cr-56: this gun is probably the overall best (non-op) ar in the game with good damage, decent fire rate and good everything from handling to recoil. you can kit it differently to further pronounce cqb or long range, but no matter what you choose, it is a solid pick

ram-7: the ram is essentially a faster firing m4. it otherwise handles very similar. it has fast handling in ads, ads movement, etc and imo very nice irons. the only downside you might find is a dislike for recoil patterns going to the left, which i personally don't mind. but even if you do, give the gun a rry, the first ~10 bullets go almost straight up.

m4: here comes the m4, the jack of all trades but master of none. it's best at absolutely nothing except one thing and that's not being bad at anything. it just gives you a versatile and consistent experience with solid performance

aug: personally my top pick for best smg, as long as you use 5.56. you combine the upsides of ar and smg by getting damage and range that are more in line with ars, but keeping smg handling, especially in terms of sprintout time or weapon swap times, which are important for aggressive playstyles. up close you need 3 shoots anywhere in the body and your 4 shot range goes out to about 60m when hitting chest shots. although the killing potential is slightly slower than the mp5, it's more consistent by not punishing hits to limbs and offering much better range. the only real downside is that you'd have to get used to the gun, as it feels and plays quite a bit different than most others.

mp5: the mp5 is a gun that has one of the best killing potentials up close with a very fast ttk in the 3 shot range, however it also requires a lot of accuracy to consistently hit torso without mixing in limb shots. however even with limb shots it's a good gun overall. it has good handling, easy recoil, good damage output and a rather high, and thus forgiving, fire rate. basically everything you need for a top tier gun",-0.8981,0.156,0.694,0.15

mw on all platforms becomes a standalone game once again, revert the leveling back to the way it was where once you hit 155 that�s it since the game is losing speed and will just be another yearly cod to most, and since we probably won�t see anymore seasons

warzone either becomes a standalone or integrated into cw where that leveling and such is tied together but leaves mw alone, then when we see cod 2021 warzone (if alive by then) will be integrated into that title

it's so bad it's not even a contest imo.  you can't play it like a smg in the current spr as val and reg meta gun meta.  but its side to side bounce is so bad that you cant play it like an ar either. even the bizon is better bc of various intangibles like better irons and default mag.  striker is top class in hc but just really bad in core.  you actually have two drop sbmm brackets to be able to do well with it bc worse opponents gives you more reaction times that the gun needs.",-0.9754,0.228,0.683,0.089

25365,">i used to think it was the iso or striker, but after getting them gold i think the striker is decent - you just have to play differently, use it like a mobile-ar. and the iso is alright - just lacks in a lot of areas, but there's no fatal flaw.

i think you're off base here.  if your argument is to play the striker like an ar, then that means you have to say the same thing for the aug which, well, just does better all around than the striker.  it has better hipfire, better mag options, and a better ttk in almost all situations with the 5.56 mag.  it also has lower recoil.  if anything, the striker leans into being an smg way more than the aug.  

as for the iso...its just bad.  you're basically stuck taking a mag option, the irons are terrible, the visual recoil is terrible, its weak at every range, it has a slow reload....its only saving grace is excellent hipfire, but with such a terrible ttk...who cares?  it also has the best ads movement but....that means you can only take advantage of one of its two redeeming features at any given time.  no fatal flaws?  it has the lowest damage of any smg, with only a marginally faster fire rate than the mp5.

>now that i have smgs platinum, i think it's the bizon. the bizon has some pretty jarring fatal flaws with range and ttk. it feels like all my kills with the bizon are from shooting an enemy's back... because i get outgunned when face to face.

if the bizon's range and ttk is a fatal flaw, then it has to be a flaw for the similarly bad iso.  at least the pp19 has a good mag size from the jump.

>lastly, the fennec is here because i feel there's no way to kit it appropriately. it's a beast close range but once you increase it's laughable range it moves like you're holding a scar, and your bullet velocity, recoil, and range are still ass. if you don't like to play cqc i can easily see this as being the worst gun in the game.

well uhhh, then dont kit it for range?  you trying to force the gun to be what it's not is the problem, its not the gun's problem.  

kit it for a rusher class and extreme cqc.  then it's great.

i'm surprised the striker is the most voted for. its got the best smg range and a solid ttk to the chest in its 3 shot kill range. its definitely not great but i would much rather have my striker class then my bizon or iso classes. 

fennec is pretty terrible also. it has great cqb ttk potential but at the same time its super slow reload and the bv and large mag attachments that are almost required for it make it's handling too slow to compete with other top tier cqb smgs. kinda has the handling of a 556 drum mag aug but without the range bonus that the aug gets with the 556 conversion.",-0.1933,0.133,0.732,0.135
