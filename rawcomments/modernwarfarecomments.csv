That was quite the sight when you came around that corner.
"GG mate


Although this one made me a bit salty.. This fucking map is the size of my backyard yet these fuckers find a dark corner to sit as a team"
"Worst part is the middle, you always get people camping up top or in some nook, which really slows the pace of the match. I once got a killcam with a jokr though for 2 up top, which was satisfying."
Wouldn't surprise me if they spawned there.
"When your team is in that corner, you�re getting fucked up.  Worst place to get pinched, nade city"
They�re being spawn trapped
That�s why I carry Semtex
"Molotovs too! Then they panic and run right back around the corner, to you."
"WHERE ARE THESE LOBBIES? WHERE ARE THE AS-VAL'S? WHERES THE MIC RAGE? THE DAMASCUS CAMO? 

You took a wrong turn at Albuquerque or something mate"
"Honestly i feel AS Val sweats are either in below average or super high skill lobbies, the rest of the lobbies are pretty chill (alas I�m in below average because gold grind sucks)"
My lobbies are chill af not gonna lie. Only see sweats very late (like 1-3am)
I live in Albuquerque
You ruined their camping trip
Literal dollar tree headset lol
"Double kill

Triple kill

Overkill

Killtacular

Killrocity

Killermanjaro

Wait wrong game series"
Killionaire as well.
The fact that I heard every single one of these in the overlord voice
Campbelievable
I�m here for the gang bang
[obligatory sauce.](https://youtu.be/PZtxBZ9D5sI)
C-4 FTW!!
E.O.D: i gonna stop you right there
One thermite and they�re all sticky and stuck
"why can�t I get lobbies like this .-. 

If this was my lobby I would have gotten sound whored and the dude would have pre fired, jump shot around the corner with mp5 and killed me"
Casual day in England
Why the hell is it 14 kills to get your VTOL?
That's the real question I am So confused
How did you knife instead of melee?
I had a throwing knife
My god am I fucking tired of the Kar98. That and that newer bolt action is all I�m ever killed by anymore.
"And then the match ends with ""Final Kill"" instead of ""Play of the Game"""
It was a three place from me instead of that
What in the potatoe nation
So anyway I started swinging....
"i never stay still on this map, pretty much just do laps around the outside. Sometimes you encounter something like this, other times they are all pointed your way and insta-death"
How are you knifing them instead of weapon budding?
Gotta have a throwing knife equipped. Changes from butting to knifing.
I always rpg that tunnel
"Rust is one of my favourite maps, but like only for TDM, and for any other game modes, I hate it (except maybe demolition). Like it�s too small for tactical advances and that sorta fun but too big for chaotic small shipment like fun where you can charge with a bayonet and a shotgun."
Is rust 24/7 back!?!
No
I fucking hate Rust so much. I would almost argue that Shipment has better spawns than Rust at times
Gotta love spawning in the same corner the whole match
Melee is to powerful.
Melee has been an instant kill in every cod tho.
No it�s not (due to the existence of footsteps... and guns).
"Yet eveyone wonders why console players are ""bad"" on MW.

We can't fucking see very well with a smooshed screen and gun up the nose while everyone else has 100+ FOV"
"yeah bro i never realised what a disadvantage it was until i played on high FoV and then went back to MW, shut sucks"
Screw the next gen fov support. We need 120 hz/fps on PS5 !
"i�d rather the FoV slider on 60fps tbh, wakes way more of a difference imo"
"Xbox already had 120hz for MW and it hasn�t been properly optimized, runs pretty bad for 90% of the people"
I wouldn't get your hopes up.
You have a mute button. Assholes are assholes. Just mute the guy and be done with it.
You wanna play with someone like that? I�ve been com banned for saying way less then that
Just get over it snowflake. Theres a mute button for a reason.
You want to play with toxic ass teammates? People on my team are leaving the game
"Yeeeeaaaaaaah

&#x200B;

While that is no way okay, it kinda comes with CoD. 

&#x200B;

Just mute em. 

&#x200B;

Doubt you're gonna get any other answer."
"I am 22 now, but as a kid this is totally something me and my best-friend at the time would have laughed hysterically at whilst playing split screen... In other words, this post really takes me back. Thanks!"
"Oh, the good old split screen play... Exactly what the newest cods ruined. PCs, even through they are much stronger than consoles - don't have split screen - consoles split-screen is just unplayable...  
Anyways,  
I'm glad I brought you good memories! :)"
JTF 2 gang where ya at. But ngl the milsims are the coolest operators in this game.
JTF 2 gang baby
always gotta rock my Canadian brethren
"Nah JW GROM is where it�s at

JTF and PJ are great ones"
That is because they stick most closely to what we were promised when the game first came out. Realisim. Hence the sim part.
JTF 2 and Shadow Company for allegiance
"Lack of an nvg mount bothers me.  
Otherwise nice MW2 vibes.  


I prefer the GROM boi"
Ayyyyyy!GROM for the win
RAMIREZ!!! TAKE OUT THE BLACK GIMP SUIT GIRL ON THAT CHOPPER WITH YOUR SHADES!!!
RAMIREZ! TAKE DOWN THAT AC130 WITH THIS SPOON AND REMEMBER TO AIM DOWN YA SIGHTS!
RAMIREZ! TAKE OUT THAT CHOPPER GIMP NOW!!!
RAMIREZ USE YOUR FACE MASK TO ENTER THE STORE PROPERLY THEY REQUIRE FASK MASKS!!
RAMIREZ!!! PROTECT THE BURGER GIMP
"Honestly, the mil-sim skins are the best skins in the game"
BIG FACTS. The Russian skins in particular are dope
I've been looking for this one which one is it?
"It's in ""Fearless"" Endowment pack, you can't get it anymore."
"Not available anymore for some reason. It was a charity skin and proceeds went to veterans, and then they reached a goal and just stopped giving them money?"
This is the only skin I bought for the game! It's realistic and the money went towards a good cause.
Couldn't have said it any better.
Where did it go?
Venerated gang!
I always pick allegiance mil-sim operator because FSB skin
I wish the skins would�ve all been milsim and had 50 or so uniforms from different militaries. I guess a lot of people wouldn�t like that though.
"Nope, apparently what sells is having a Raven �kill� special forces operators in seconds, and the raven�s owner then shooting some pink tracers that turn the target human into a pile glowing cubes. 

Activision really stuck the landing on the �realism� promise that they made."
"Mil sim operator at the capitol riots 
What will he do"
Idk I don�t see commie Russians China looks tasty tho
Hope they add that Camo to the next games mil-sims since it is the new standard Camo of the US.
I think the marines use marpat still could be wrong
I always run the Canadian soldier one cus I'm from Canada tho it bugs me so fucking much that when he specks it says us Fireteam or something like that
"I like several of the milsim skins, my favorite being the USMC Raider one"
Good choice
Best skin for sure. I rep this and the lagunari for coalition and balkan or shadow company mil sim for allegiance
Shadow company 2 and 3 are so lit
I use the Uzbekistan soldier with the beard and the cap when in warzone/plunder
One of the coolest milsim skins  is none other than our lord and savior Bale's skin Protectorate based on the Alpha group.
I only use mil-sims. The whole operator concept is bullshit.
Looks like he about to step onto an IED.
CTSFO II and BALKAN GANG
I use Marine Raider III and Shadow Company III. Fuck operators I�m wearing realistic kit
Double tap interact maybe
NOOB
What if he just hasn�t used c4 yet?
"Can�t tell you how to detonate C4 early since I use controller, but maybe try doing the interact button twice. That�s the second use of reload for remote.

For pistols, go into HC. They one shot there 90% of the time."
"You can almost use a pistol like a sniper in hardcore haha, if you have a good shot there�s nothing to it."
"thought about hardcore, but tbh, i never really played much of hardcore since i never really was a fan. but will try it out for pistol"
"hit square twice and it just blows (not sure what button for PC..). it doenst show the animation of pulling out the detonator, it just blows"
Throw first c4 then hit f twice
I think it's FF but I have it bound to EE
For leveling up pistols (or any weapon that is hard) play plunder and do contracts. You get 500 weapon xp for each contract. If you use a double weapon xp token and do 4-5 contracts you can level up a pistol in a few rounds. Just make sure that the weapon that you want to level up is the one you are holding when the contract finishes.
"Fuck people who ""play Dom for kills"" and then only get 30 kills...

If you wanna frag in Dom, you better be hitting 50 minimum."
They should have stuck with team death match lol! They might have been playing domination to pad their stats but instead got their asses handed to them lmao!
I asked in game if they were playin domination or tdm cuz they didnt stand on any objective i was the only 1 goin for them
Barely any defends either! Why even play an objective based game mode? Just stick to TDM!!
"To farm easy kills. I get teams like that all the time. It's the matchmaking, if you're an avid obj Player, you end up with these dudes to 'balance' the teams."
"Over the past year they did a lot of optimizing the install size since it was getting out of hand, namely compressing some textures as well as separating and releasing high res packs for those that would still like the higher detail textures. 

Throughout all of this it reorganizes the base install i assume, I remember weird behavior happening with installs back then with me and my brothers� consoles, having to reinstall packs. But you�re right that Warzone *should* be optional, alas it�s their most successful product right now as a way to push both free to play Warzone & MW players into Cold War"
"I'm trying to get damascus on mp5, hardest challenge is the longshots, I see your point in kingslayer trios, but what optic should I use because I barely have any experience in one of them, (I have all attachments for MP5)"
"Definitely a high zoom. 

I ditched my mp load out and went with all recoil control, range and zoom. 
You won�t need much speed for this, if you�re you�re only aiming to get longshots."
shoothouse with a scope is how i did it
"Good advice, thanks. Long shots and Mounted are the thorns in my side for the Bizon."
"You literally missed all of the good maps, for me it�s Gun Runner, Shoothouse, Hackney yard, Sawmill"
OP has a problem with 3 lane maps
Why did you put the worst maps on this game in the poll?
Khandor or hackney
Shoot house
"Shoot house, easily"
shoot house
"Out of the listed ones Atlas Superstore is the best, but the best original map is Khandor Hideout"
"Khandor Hideout is an amazing map, but the mid building is such a strong hold point on the map.

That makes for great engagements there to hold that point."
Shoot house
"Hackney, gun runner, or ramaza."
Shoot house
You just listed everybody�s least favorite maps except Atlas
"I didnt know Atlas was popular, my initial plan was to include the least favourite maps in the poll to see how they would stack against each other.

After this poll ends, I would do a part 2, 5 of the options will be based on the comments here. The last option would be the map with the most votes in part one."
shoot house
Honestly I'm in the minority but I really liked Grazna Raid and Arklov Peak. Those have become pretty iconic to me.
"I half-like both of them, literally. Not that I want to fix anything, I see potentials, but I just want half of the map. Even in 10v10 those maps are still way to big, 12v12 would do it(SnD 12v12 were damn good on those maps) but it make no sense not resizing the map for 6v6, yet it�s still in the rotation, while a 6v6 worthy map like ShootHouse rarely pops up.

They should have done what Battlefield did. Having the same map resized for each game mode and player counts. MW maps to me doesn�t really has a complexity problem, lanes are still defined but have more routes to move around. What it has size and player-count incompatibility problems. There is no reason for Grazna Raid or Arklov Peak to be in 6v6�s rotation if they didn�t even bother to resize it."
"Shoothouse. Take it or leave it lol most of the maps you listed are pure Garbo. I love mw19, probably my second most played cod game of all time. But let�s not kid ourselves, the maps weren�t the greatest."
"Hovec Sawmill, Shoothouse, and/or Gunrunner."
"Atlas is the best one you listed. I can't speak for respawn gamemodes, but it is one of the best flowing maps for SnD. I play it every chance I can get."
"hackney yard, gun runner, khandor hideout and havoc sawmill are all good maps"
"Map design hasn't changed from the original MW trilogy, maybe the jetpack ones but not the OG. Anyway I really like Grazna, idk why because I dont always even do well in it and and can be difficult at times but I guess I just like how many different ways you can play it."
"Khandor Hideout, Gun Runner, Rammaza and (unpopular opinion) Petrov Oil rig and Euphrates Bridge"
Oil Rig at least is pretty good. Though the spawn areas are unnecessarily large
I picked Piccadilly. I feel slightly evil today
Shoot house or Khandor
"Khandor without a doubt, also why did you put the least popular maps on this list?"
"To see how much votes they would get in contrast to each other. 

After this poll ends, I would do a part 2, 5 of the options will be based on the comments here. The last option would be the map with the most votes in part one."
"Shoothouse, Khandor, Hovec and Hackney Yard!"
"These are some of my favourite maps in the game lol

I don't really care for remakes. If they do bring them back I'd like them to be changed. No idea how (like I say these are some of my favourite maps - I wouldn't change a thing) but the idea of bringing them back exactly the same seems wrong to me.  

I'd rather new maps to the same standard. I love the MW maps and hope they keep making maps like this. Less generic symmetrical 3 lane maps, the better."
Superstore is overrated af
"Khandor Hideout or Rammaza. Rammaza doesn't seem to be so popular but I find it one of the more enjoyable maps, especially on Domination or Cyber Attack"
S H O O T   H O U S E
For me aniyah palace
"But if wr have to be more accurate to your question then ill pick sawmill, shoothouse, Cheshire park, gun runner"
those who chose Grazna Raid or St. P work for activision
"CW: No flinch, crazy scope-in times on top of ADS, no momentum gun sway.

Mw: Flinch, realistic scope ins and reasonable ADS, momentum based gun sway, require real skill to quickscope.

Actual snipers. Not the cheesy marksmans.

Notice: This is how I feel personally. You are welcome to disagree."
CW no flinch tundra is brokenly op in a game with 150 hp longer ttk reg guns slow reg gun bullet velocity.  I'll take facing addy quick scoping any day over CW tundra bs.  It's absly broken.
"Cold War snipers have much less flinch, but their painfully slow ADS times make them near-unusable"
Modern warfare all the way
In cold war  the hit boxes are huge for snipers but the ADS is slower than the HDR which would be much heavier then any other sniper in coldwar but the .50 cal (which won't 1 shot half the time) In modern warfare the snipers have a smaller hit box that actually makes quick scoping take skill and a much faster ADS time
"u put a poll on here with cold war and modern warfare and say nothing and MW is gonna win. 

the people who stayed on this sub love MW like an 8th grader loves their crush. if you want unbiased polls, sorry you can't have one xD"
"Actually, th pols say the same in bocw subreddit. Mw winning too."
"True, im gonna try in cold war subredit, to see if its true."
Cuz of insane hitboxes.
Spr says everything. If you have a weapon that 1 shot kills and ads faster faster than a smg you're done
Broadcast is CoD 4 btw
"Mb man, didnt know that. Thought it was from warzone"
"Why isn�t shoothouse on here? The only map worth a shit lol and POSSIBLY Azhir Cave. The rest, can be deleted off existence."
"Deleted this post because I included Broadcast, thought it was from warzone until someoen pointed out that it was a CoD4 Map

"Most definitely Shoothouse, 2nd place shared by Petrov Oil Rig and Khandor Hideout, all very fun maps, but Shoothouse comes out on top with its chaotic gameplay and various combat ranges.  


~~BTW, Broadcast is a remake of a CoD4 map.~~"

"Activision never cared about hackers, not when warzone was first released and certainly not now when theyre trying so hard to push CW down our throats.

Such a shame as WZ has a lot of potential"
"Man its funny how the culture of the game and who it appeals to, affects the quality of the game."
monitor issue? same thing happened to my tv. If it�s just in game i�d google..
"Just in game yea, can�t find it anywhere."
"Hey, I had this problem last year! I'm not at home to look at the game but it has something to do with the graphics settings. I think it's resolution needs to be set to 100. I tried setting mine higher but for some reason my pc had the same issues you're having. Game still looks great but you just have to change that setting to 100 and it'll be fine!"
This fixed it! Thanks!
Maybe it's an issue of the game not completely fitting the screen
"I wish there was an option to enable this on any map at will.

Friday night disco CoD squad!"
I've been getting this when turning on dynamic resolution.
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa...
It�s got Zombies. It�s not complete garbage."
"I wish we took BOCW Zombies with MW Polish, Guns & Movement, imagine pack a punched AA-12s or PKMs."
"It�s literally the easiest zombies, but the juggernaut things are hard to take out without a ray gun or a double pack a punched gun.

only 2 maps, boring characters and horrible dialogues, full autos are very weak and are useless, wonder weapons are too hard to get, outbreak is fun but very buggy, unpolished, and theres not enough zombies.

Spilt-screen wasn�t at the launch of the game, not enough perks, cliched missions/tasks, can I go on?"
Fuck that WHERE IS THE FUCKING SPARKS BUNDLES SO THEY CAN FINALLY NERF AS VAL AND SPR AFTER
The Sparks bundle comes with an AS VAL lol I doubt they nerf it.
"Hey tomorrow is a Thursday, which means potential updates, I suspect..."
Not for new Ops tho

Ironic because you camp this subreddit while kissing up to treyarch"
Damn all these comments and you�re getting downvoted to hell lmao Vondy isn�t gonna fuck you bro
Cold War is the campiest cod game ever.

It hasnt since cold war came out
"You don�t get double xp for trials (well you do sort of) they halve the amount you would usually get as you have discovered, hence the two x five and not two x ten."
Thats fuckin stupid why wont it just say 2xp does not work.
"Before cold war came out, they worked. You could get 22,000 xp per trial. The parkour one in st petrograd takes 45 seconds, so you could get over a million xp per hour with enough tokens"
"Yeah, sadly this is �normal� for us split screen players. I wanna say fuck COD (or really Activision) for screwing us over like this but I really do love the game sm so it�s actually upsetting to know that they�ve just up and left the game in such a mess. Especially recently, I�ve been experiencing PS5 freeze crashes from COD and the only solution is just plugging the plug - never used to happen a few weeks ago but hey! That�s fucking Activision for ya"
Same thing happens to me playing split screen on xbox. Has been broken since beginning of February. They dont seem to care and cold war is even worse
Play private match... splitscreen Is complete Broken And CoD suport dont care
For me is the same i only have one ps4 and i want to gring
"Yes... I just posted the same question before I saw your post. I have no idea what�s happening, my guess is that it�s some kind of glitch that they just aren�t fixing on purpose in order to push more people to buy cold war. Fucking sucks, I just bought the game (I play very casually) so my brother and I could hop on together on the weekends and it happens every time"
You went to Brazil
Battlefield 1 in a nutshell
Why did the body go that far
Team defender needs to die in a fire.  livestock 4v4 needs to be perma
Team Defender and Grind in the 4v4 Face-Off game mode end within like 45 seconds.
And landed in Coldwar.

thank you !
I would recommend adding a question about which games you've played to eliminate some bias.
i played all except valorant and can safely say mw wins on all categories
Ahh yes I planned to do this but were restricted to 4 questions only :(
"I gotchu, g"
I think each game does what it does well. You can�t really compare apples to oranges it just becomes what type of fps style you prefer and not really about mechanics . Still best of luck on gathering your data!

"MP is the quickest. A lobby like shoot the ship for most camos. I use domination and hardpoint if STS or similar smaller maps aren't options, since more players are moving. Hardcore for pistols, shield, and any other harder to get kills weapons."
They might have been talking about your acc lvl because I�m pretty sure multiplayer is the best
"To level weapons I usually went through co-ops special ops.  That way I could play with different attachments and get a feel for what I liked without too much trouble.  Warzone can give good experience but you have to have that particular weapon in use when you finish a contract to get the experience, and there�s no guarantee you�ll finish a contract.

Multiplayer can level pretty quick, but it depends  on how many kills you manage in a match whereas special ops I could determine how much I�d gain in advance.

Hope that helps."
"If you�re trying to level them up quickly playing Warzone then just play Plunder, get a helicopter, and fly around doing supply runs all game

That way you�re always doing your contracts"
I never knew about trying this. Probably will later thanks.
"Multiplayer is good if there are good playlists but another way is co-op survival which seems to work pretty good for me, maybe give that a try but to answer your question multiplayer is probably the best choice."
"Mulitplayer is the best if you can consistently get a lot of kills every match. 

Survival mode/co op is decent

Plunder is pretty good, but really boring. If you're using plunder you want to get a helicopter at the start of the match, and fly around doing supply run contracts. Youll never have to leave the helicopter to do supply runs, just fly over the buystation, and then straight for the next one. Youll get weapon xp for whatever weapon is in your hand each contract you do. And if you see someone you can get a quick, easy kill on, then thats extra xp"
Thanks for all the replies guys :)
Nah it�s co-op�s operation strongbox

Team tactical on the OG MW2 was so fun! They def should have brought it back. I'm sure the remake will be in it
God I hope so. Now I'm kind of obsessed with having a TPP. I swear MW3 also had something like that too
Wouldn�t bet on them getting back to you quickly...same happened to me 3 months ago and they haven�t helped in anyway whatsoever apart from emailing me every 5 days saying it�s gonna take another 5 days...
Fuck that sucks my man. Hope it gets solved for you
"But don't worry, they'll get right on shadow banningyou or perma banning you for the person who stole your account using hacks."
literally exactly what happened to me
Fill out a ticket asap should be 5-7 days and you get it back
Yea I filled it out as soon as I got the email. Clicked the link in it and the ticket was sent.

"Raven is fallout76 banning people with this latest wave, just spray and pray, ton of content creators were hit too lol oy."

A game that people paid money for to play.
"This is just Reddit, go outside"
"I have a similar issue with **shoot first yet still die** using the same weapon build as an enemy player and hitting all my shots yet I am killed first which to this day makes no sense to me. I am practically mag dumping into people's chests (not missing btw) for them to lethal-tap me.

The kill cam only shows me standing there looking at the enemy which isnt what happened on my end???

Especially in Hardcore where your team is getting CLEAR hitmarkers with 1 tap weapons (FAL, ODEN, EBR, etc) on lethal zones while the enemy team has instant one-hits with non-one hit weapons on your treammates is absurd."
Nah you're just trash
^ this
"The game hasn't had a major update to the core or SBMM in forever, so nothings changed. You just need to improve."
"Nah, almost every lobby i get is nukeable and normal servers. If anything, i'd say it became easier than usual"
If you reverse boost yeah.
"im in the same boat as op, i think there might be a goldilock zone for connections, or maybe you got a 1tb up down, that does the trick?

ie. matchmaking me as a dutchy (300km+ from backbone amsterdam) with southern europe, russia or the usa in the same lobby can only result in lag and you can only hope the compensation/sbmm  falls to you"
"Not gonna lie ever since CW came out my lobbies have got way easier. I used to feel sbmm sometime during the games lifecycle but now it's basically non-stop bot lobbies

Are you playing with an ethernet cable? Might be connection issues on your side"
"I mean I play on around 100ish ms and I do fine, I had the same issue last week but mines back to normal"

Would getting a vpn help?
"it's been a thing while player hosted lobbies were a thing, you wouldn't believe how often i got ddos'd back in bo2. Just avoid anything player hosted and you should be fine"
It was in SnD
Mans can't even track you with it lol
Because I'm FAST AS FUCK BOOYYYY
Probably because of the higher player count. May I ask why you are disabling crossplay for PC only? I have my guess but I'd like to hear from you.
My guess that teammates may be on console and have lower FOV which matters a lot if you play search and destroy
Some PC players want to avoid controller users with aim assist. Same sorta people that want to avoid pc players because of kbm haha

"1. i dunno but that screenrecording screen at the end makes me doubt that that is really your gameplay  
2. you used emojis in the title soo downvote(advice: your on reddit, don't use emojis)"
Because I recorded it on my Xbox app?
Matter of fact message my gamer tag in the bottom left corner screenshot the video zoom in and I will respond to you on Xbox letting you know you�re wrong
You�re just mad he�s better than you
If it's a shadow ban and you didn't do anything it'll end eventually anywhere from 3-7 days I think. But if you where running suspicious programs (usually programs used for hacking sometimes coding programs) we'll playing cod and it was picked up by there system you might have to make an appeal or you are SOL.
"Well, if discord is a suspicious program then I�m guilty."
How is a 0.8 kd suspicious?
I was being sarcastic :)
yea ok hacker
"If you have no helpful feedback or criticism keep walking, thanks! :)"
Everyone knows you don't just stick your head up over there.
Theres literally like 5+ different posts of ppl doing this same exact thing idk why ppl upvote them. It was mildly funny the first time
I mean if u are first there u will be dominating the mid peeks

How did he not see you
"I have no idea, probably didn�t have headphones either haha"
Look through the blueprints of the guns and click on that one you want. It should pull the bundle up.
They rotate weekly you can guy packs to increase your odds of getting it lol.
"They�ve removed a lot of bundles to make way for Warzone/CW battle pass content, Zip Tie has been missing for a while so I�m worried it won�t return :/"
I saw it in mine a few weeks ago so idk. Everyone�s is different so that might just be bad luck
Ain't no fuckin slouch let's go
When meth is a gameplay mechanic.
So that�s what�s in those stims!
i fucking hate everyone using that electric ak on hardcore
Hardscoping for sure
Completing challenges and getting wins are mutually exclusive... and if you didn�t get a single kill it�s probably more your fault. Even vs sweats you can always catch somebody pushing or not checking corners.
Given I had pretty much given up for 3/4ths of the match because of how upset i was. So me getting 0 kills was definitely me
"Work on other progress till shoot the ship is up and then grind them all there.

That's how I did it... 

Or just endure and play it out till it's done"
"Yea, I think im just gonna take a semi break and just wait until shoot the ship is back."
"If you got 0 kills I don't think it's the gun, you just need to relax man, no reason to get stressed, just backout and find the next game"
"That�s the easiest of the camo challenges, have fun riot shielding and rocket launching as val rozes"
"Depends on the weapon. Some are a little bit tricky, but for the most it isn�t that problem."
It always feels like a kick in the balls to go from a 5 attachment max level gun to 0 attachments lol. Really painful every time
Hardcore shoot the ship or hardcore in general
have youdone the Kilo yet?
You just suck m8. No attachments are definitely way easier than longshots
"Not today, Satan."
"Want my credit card? Social insurance? First born? 


While your intentions may or may not be pure, too many people have been burned.


 Have you tried contacting infinityward to get your account reset?"
I feel bad for whoever falls for this
This seems fishy but I wish you luck with finding someone who's willing to let you use their account
cant you just make a new activision account and start over?
"You have to buy the game again (At least on PC), but OP is probably a scammer"
"Nice try, if someone is willing to spend at least another 5 days playing and grinding the camos, you'd think he would be willing to buy another copy or get an legit account of eBay for little money."
"You�ll have to play against bots until you�re able to hold up in public lobbies, looks like"
"I just watched a video on YouTube recommending to practice in a drill, I'll try it, hopefully I'll get better first at knowing maps and movement"
Level does not equal skill. You could suck at playing forever and you would still level up to 100+. Even if you only get 10 kills a game. Ive had a level 1 destroy me in a match and I'm max prestige. People make new accounts just to play against new players with low K/D ratios. And there's very few new players since the game has been out so long. You'll mostly only find experienced players either way. Your best bet would be to just bear with it until you can find your groove. The games SBMM will keep punishing you until you do.
Do it's just matter of time
"The games been out 16 months, theres very few new players."
Try different game types as well as core vs hardcore. Spend some time learning the maps and before you know it you'll be passing 10 kills per round!
"Thank you, bud! I'll try it out"
After a while you logically will play with guys close to your level due to the SBMM.
How do u accedently pick up a gun while sliding
"Not sure off the top of my head, all my buttons are remapped on my scuff, probably tried to close the door behind me or something."
Nice recovery.
"I loved the Carcano in battlefield 1 buuuuuut


MUH MOIST NUGGET"
"everyone loves the garbage rod, even more so if you can make the obrez out of it"
I wish I could change the spr into a gun that shoots the user instead
we all would want that
Imagine the cursed possibilities of the mosin!
2 words. Akimbo. Obrez.
I imagine they chose the Kar98 because IIRC IRL terrorist groups use them.
"they use mosins and lee enfields too, well mostly mosins, enfields and k98s are not as common."
What? Terrorists uses kar98? That shit is really expensive
Mosin would be badass
Gewher 95
The mosin is probably a basic ass bitch request for all of the WAW players like me. But it is an awesome rifle as is the Kar.
The Kar98k is broken
gimme the Arisaka lmaoooo
"o shit, i totally forgot about the arisaka"
Mosin-Nagant for bolt-action but M1 Garand would be pretty cool imo
it could be added as a m14 conversion
The SMLE would make a lot of sense if there was an Indian faction in the game. Reservists still use it over there i believe.
I hope they fix the server issues some people have
"Oh god, i had that issue a couple of weeks ago. It�s so annoying."
"Obviously CW has the more player count since it's the latest CoD game. There is a website that shows fake numbers for playercounts tho (it indicates that MW19 MP has more players than WZ which is laughable).

In terms of sales, I don't think it sold as high as MW but I'm pretty sure it sold good enough for ATVI. What some people don't realize is that It's pretty irrational to expect every game to break the previous game's sales record. Before MW19, the most sold CoD of all time was MW3 meaning CoD games after that didn't surpass MW3 sales. Does that make all CoD games after MW3 bad games? no.

Sales depend on many factors. MW19 was destined to be the highest selling. I mean, just think:

* Boots on the ground
* the name MODERN WARFARE
* Return of classic characters
* Return to Modern settings
* New engine
* 32v32 to appeal to BF players
* WARZONE"
"Spitting facts right here,it think it helped cold war (and MW3) that the game before them were a success, I'm not saying that's the only reason"
If the game wasn't called MW it would've been in the bin with Ghosts
"-32v32 to appeal to BF players

Can confirm that. Came for ground war, ended falling in love with the game but hating ground war with my soul"
Is it playercounter?
As far as I know that data just is not published. The best option I can think of is compare matchmaking time while trying to control as many variables as you can and testing many times then seeing if there is a large difference.
"I would love for MW to have more but that�s not realistic to expect. Both games broke sales records. However, I�ve heard that most (vocal) players avoid multiplayer and play zombies. I�m the other hand, MW was on a path of self-destruction before support was cut, and is obviously going to have the natural playerbase decline."
"Cold War broke sales records didn't it?

We don't have exact numbers"
">According to industry analyst firm SuperData (courtesy of Viral Junkie  CEO Tom Henderson), Black Ops Cold War made $678 million in its first  six weeks of sales. That's not bad, and certainly enough to make back  Activision's development and marketing costs, but it didn't sell nearly  as well as Modern Warfare which made [$600 million in just *three days*](https://www.thegamer.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-sales/), and over [$1 billion after two months](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/call-duty-modern-warfare-1-most-played-call-duty-multiplayer). 

[https://www.thegamer.com/black-ops-cold-war-sales-were-a-lot-slower-than-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/](https://www.thegamer.com/black-ops-cold-war-sales-were-a-lot-slower-than-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/)"
"It was for digital sales, not raw numbers."
Do you have the singularity bundle?
Yes. Got it when it became available.
I haven�t but sometimes you can look up which weapon it came with and then go to create a class and look at the shop options for that weapon and you may find it.
The  weapon is the PP19 Bizon and it's not there either.
"do u have ""black diamond"" kar98k? i really want it"
Yes. It's part of the Snow Cover operator bundle.
i never see this bundle in the store after season one
"I just kept buying operator bundles until it appeared in the store. Also, keep checking the Kar98K blueprint section for the bundle."
So u have all bundles? really cool!
"All operator bundles, not all weapon bundles. I also have 3 operator bundles from Cold War that have Modern Warfare operators in them."
Red Domino is hot :-D
Matches are so much better when everyone has mics.
Gunplay isn�t your speciality is it? The as Val does in deed suck ass to play against but their lies a golden lining. Just riot shield 725. Fuck their feelings
"So basically the only way to deal with gimps is to gimp back? It�s every game, not just every other or 1 in 3, every game guaranteed"
Whose lies a golden lining?
IW abandoned MW so it will forever be full of gimp suit rozes and as vals
Season 5 last time mw was good
"The AS Val def needs a recoil nerf (stronger recoil)


The spr DEFINITELY needs either higher ads time, or the fucking lmb reduction from the kar98k added to it as its literally the kar98k but BETTER"
It�s like they knew it was gonna be the last season so why not add broken as fuck guns the games gonna die anyway
"The AS VAL likely won't be nerfed because the game is already barely supported. However it does need one badly, and it should deal less damage. There's no reason for this gun to kill potentially faster than the MP5 while having way more effective range and actually decent mobility for an AR. It being a 3 shot kill to the chest at its insane RPM is a fucking joke; it's like an MG34 but with all of its weaknesses removed."
You can see it this way: The As Val is basically the M13 with buffed mobility and permanent Stopping Power
"MP5 never got a proper nerf, imo"
I�m pretty sure they�ve ditched modern warfare. Warzone is getting suckier too and there�s nothing we can do except watch
"The other ARs need a slight buff , but It's really  hard to balance all guns for all skill levels.    The Lesser  AR's def need TTK buffs and less recoil.   The AS is too easy to laser someones head....  The balance is tbh pretty good tho IMO.  I can get kills and be somewhat effective with crossbow, knives shotguns, lmgs.  I usually only break out the AS VAL / SPR combo when the other team is being sweaty af.        


Video related:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vekH-QOfM2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vekH-QOfM2s)"
"Other rifles are fine, it�s just the val which needs nerfing. Make it an extra bullet to kill at all ranges an it�s fine. The fact it can kill people in 3 bullets an has the same fire rate as an mp7 n m13 is ridiculous."
[removed]
Take it your one of those who run it every game?
"""Get gud"" doesn't apply when getting shredded by a gun that shouldn't be able to so much damage at all ranges."
"Hm, I agree it needs a nerf but its like how nerfing a sniper would ruin it without careful choice. Nerf the Recoil and ads time for the 30 round magazine."
"The fact it can kill in 3 bullets is the problem not the recoil or ads, it shouldn�t be that powerful if it shoots that quick."
"I doubt it's ever going to get nerfed. The small mag size means that theres no balancing problem for warzone, and mw2019 multiplayer is nothing but abandoned by IW. 

It's gonna be the UMP45 of MW2019."
"I've developed a next level strategy for dealing with them.

When I see a VAL, I leave. If I pull one out and destroy them with it, you can bet the entire team will put one on after. I'd prefer to just find a different lobby then deal with 6 other players abusing it.

EDIT: I've seen a lot of people saying it needs a recoil nerf, which isn't really the main problem. It's mid range TTK is way too fast. Close range it should be unchanged, but at mid range it needs to be a 6 or 7 shot kill. I shouldn't be able to challenge snipers at 50-75M with it and win fairly consistently."
"The last barrel is what makes it op since it fixes all the weapons problems imo, so if they deleted it the val would be perfectly fine"
I�d end up backing out of majority of the games I play. Some guy put a whole clip into my dead body cause I killed him 3 times before with the amax. Like u had to put on the most overpowered gun in the game to achieve it well done shitter.
SPR them
Asval overkill spr/kar = unstoppable.
"Yes, but hear me out 10 round mag VAL sniper. That is all."
Got the idea from u/idontlikeliving
The sign just had a mental breakdown
"Have you tried a full delete then reinstall? I know, it�s like a 170GB download... About six months ago my game wouldn�t launch, it would always error out before I got to the main screen. I tried scanning the install via the Battle.net client, and other small fixes, but nothing worked. After a couple days of that I did a full reinstall, and that worked. Suuuucked downloading the whole game again."
Ya I managed to finally fix it by download the rest of the packs then had to hard restart my console twice
"Had the same problem. I don't know if you noticed, but you're getting packet burst/loss. (notice the three squares on the left middle of the screen. I had the same exact issue and gave up on it, but I'm willing to help for a solution.

Best thing to do is check if your wifi or internet in general is congested and diconnected things that aren't being used or needed a lot. Speedtesting is also good but not always accurate. Or you can test Packet loss at [www.packetlosstest.com](https://www.packetlosstest.com) 

Otherwise, antivirus softwares sometimes hinder performance with firewall rules and such. Check to see if Modernwarfare is under the exception to these rules and that under the Account tab of Options in Modernwarfare, the NAT Type is open. That typically means that it ISN'T the Antivirus software or Firewall. 

Another thing you can try is the adv.options. To edit this, you go to Documents -> Call of Duty Modern Warfare -> Player -> adv.oni     

Double clicking this should let you edit the document. See if the you are using all physical cores (so for you it would be 6 because you have 6 physical cores in your Ryzen) and not just part of them.

There's also the VRAM stopper. It is the number that is under 1 (like 0.85 I think). Turn this down to around 0.65.

After your edit the document, click file and save. Open up the game and see if it runs more smoothly. 

There's more but I don't wanna overwhelm you and it is better if you go one by one on these options so you see what works or doesn't. Lemme me with a reply. Good luck."
What�s the loadout? That things a beam
"The MW series is the best. COD4, MW2, MW3, and MW2019. COD WAW had a pretty awesome campaign as well."
Is it worth skipping COD4? I'm not too keen on playing an old-ish game. I was thinking of playing MW2 campaign remastered first then go along the series if that's okay?
Infinite warfare
my favourite campaigns are from bo1 and waw. cod1 is also pretty good
"World at War. I grew on ww2 games (COD, Medal of honor, Brothers in arms, i'll also throw in Bf1942) and I feel WAW was the last proper ww2."
Yegor + Mara best Skins for me.
I wish I had Mara but I had to make another account on PC so rip
"Yegor ugly ass hell, Roze skin users are just lowest of the low though"
"Yea, still better than that Roze skin tbh"
Just as bad as each other lol
I know it sound stupid but have you checked the audio settings in game? you might have everything turned down other than the music
Yeah I tried everything. Had to restore licenses somehow that worked
I want the tracer packs to be transferable
"Honestly, Blueprints should have worked more like skins since the beginning imo, that is, the main aesthetic being applied to all the attachments of a single gun insert of only a few per blueprint.

That way, not only you wouldn't need to choose between keeping the looks of a blueprint or making a viable loadout, but also it woule give you way more options for Gunsmith Customs, giving you more bang for your buck in the process (seeing how most of these blueprints are behind expensive Bundles in the first place).

Everyone wins, except Activision of course."
"Yes. This is exactly what I was saying to everyone I know, it should be a skin not a blueprint. I have paid for a few packs mainly for the character however the guns have looked cool, but been useless, unless I change the entire gun to be left with a small red stripe or a little shine on the mag to show it was part of said blueprint."
I doubt IW will be taking any requests
"happens to me too, usually I just have to close and restart the game and that solves the problem."
put a shirt on and clean your room my dude
I�ve given up on it. My wife and I were playing split screen but in the last month or so we get to play maybe 1 game out of 5 or 6. Most of the times it completely crashes
What happened the last time it worked? Wondering if its ddos attack a few others have had.
No
What are they gonna do? Unless you plan to Cheat.
Account sharing *is* a bannable offense if you get caught.
" nice clip, but isn�t this warzone?"
"Nicley done, Fellow pistol user"
"Do you have monitoring on? Like on the top left of your screen? What�s your gpu abs cpu time? Include other metrics if you can, I want to see how my situation compares (3070 with a 3700x, I think 2-4 ms gpu time and often 17ms cpu time)"
"I do. I monitored everything. My timings were all low and close to 2 - 4ms and highest would be 15ms. I'm running a Ryzen 3600X and Radeon 5700xt from Gigabyte. Temps and stability as is, is great. But I will say, I use to get random hitching in menu a month back that would drop my frames to 7fps and my cpu to 215ms then it would restore itself. But my main problem is hitching and packet burst (three boxes on the left side of screen with stuttering alongside it.) 

Edit: My latency would stay around 40 to 75ms. I am on wifi, but even with ethernet, I have seen this hitching bullcrap. 

GPU would stay under 65C and CPU would be below 60C so all good temps."
"Packet bursts just came back after a while so deleting the temp files isn't a permanent solution. Reading the thread update, the problem is the installation modification? Do I have to install everything about mw?
Also, It SEEMS LIKE that locking fps to 40-50 makes packet bursts disappear but, obviously, this isn't a solution."
You're correct. The temp files always come back and even installing everything isn't a permanent fix. I still get the stutters but a hella lot less frequently that is much more playable than before.
"Packet burst doesn't have anything to do with GPU CPU etc, and very likely nothing to do with the home network at all. A couple months ago I had it for an entire weekend (both MW and CW), and saw lots of others complaining of same, but other than that I've had no issue except maybe 1 match a week that rubberbands, and when I leave and requeue it's fine.

Don't know of a solution, but it's definitely not a widespread problem affecting a significant portion of players. You can try this website to see if it returns any results, it also has a ""how to fix"" section.

https://packetlosstest.com/"
My packet loss is 0.2 over 30 seconds and 1.8 packets are late which is the packet burst I get I assume?
Disabling the Offload from Ethernetcard did a right step in a better connection for me.
Explain in more detail please?
[deleted]
Please explain.
I have noticed the same. I've been stuck on my number since season 2 started despite getting several wins.
Wall hacking and aimboting nice
what do you mean
"Get more ram, i also played with 8gb ddr4 and i had random like fps drops and stutter.  
After upgrading to 16gb i had 0 problems."
"its been said before but you really need more than 8gbs of ram for warzone. Heres a comparison of 8 vs 16, 8 is pretty much unplayable [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rKYv01oetE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rKYv01oetE)"
"This video pretty much shows my problem, although i'd say my stutters are still significantly worse than shown on the video. I've ordered 16gb ram so lets hope it'll fix the problem"
8gbs of ram imo is nolonger enough for modern day games.
"Its got some very inconsistent performance I've noticed.

For my bro with his Ryzen 7 3700x/RX 5700XT setup MP and Warzone run great, easily over 200FPS but there are times where it just dips under his display's refresh rate (1080p170) out of nowhere and tears. In Cold War its worse, take Moscow for example, the long stretch of road with all the cars will drop FPS down to 160 just by looking at it, and the room with the giant gold statue if he pans his view past it then it dips down there too.

I have basically the same build but a generation behind (R7 2700x/RX580) and while I don't need to push as many frames as him (1080p120) I still am just barely able to keep my frames above my monitors limit (130-ish)

Reducing graphics settings helps a little but not by nearly as much as one would expect, I probably need to do some testing with better diagnostics tools, I wouldn't be surprised if there is some kind of garbage collection or freeing up of VRAM going on

Still a large part of your problem is likely just specs, I'm betting your VRAM is capping out at a certain point, getting freed up, then repeating."
"That might be the issue. But the thing is in the graphics settings it's saying that im only using like 2-2.5 out of 3 vram, so it still doesn't make that much sense :/"
"Seeing as you said ""lowest settings"", I'm assuming you have on-demand texture streaming turned off?

I've heard that setting can cause a lot of stuttering issues from other people."
Minimum ram for gaming 8GB with windows 10 x64 and a GTX 1660 with quadcore CPU. I would say that is bare minimum.
Hey man that�s cool and all but over edited compilations are overused here and I�m quite annoyed about it already
They took it out of search a month or two before Cold War dropped.
"It was way before that I'm pretty sure. I think they removed it back in July or June.

It's still in Hardcore Search though, which tilts me. It was such a fun map to play. Great for high kill games as well."
It�s possible. They change the map rotations every once in a while
"I play MW SnD probably around 3-4 hours a day for  months now, and it's been a few months since I've seen it :(
I mean on Rust it's more really 6v6 gun fight but it's intense"
"Is still in SnD, but only in hardcore mode."

Is it a blueprint ? No hate just wondering
This one is but you can use a default variant and use the gunsmith custom to add �al rukh� 5.56 nato 30-round mag and you will get the same result
"on the OG m4 blueprint, obsidian doesnt cover the carry handle/sight. it looks hideous. there are some other blueprints where obsidian doeant cover the whole gun"
Oh that�s cool. I have that blueprint and I don�t even know how I got it but I knew i could�ve been wrong.
"It isnt.  You just need to use a diff mag from default or other blueprint. 

Other guns like challenge m91 blueprint and don't have ammo box covered by obs, but default and other bps do."
"The default ammo box on the obsidian PKM is no longer obsidian, as of a few weeks ago. Looks terrible."
Yea I just found out. Still unique nonetheless
"It is! Fun fact, if you use the ""Slipper Clutch"" skin, the green sheen remains over the top layer of the gun.  [https://imgur.com/l3R5b1M](https://imgur.com/l3R5b1M), to show you what it looks like."
 it looks kinda clean tho
"Is it still obsidian on the green part? Regardless I love it, it reminds me of the anole blueprint for the mp5"
"[Nah, this one works so much better](https://imgur.com/Pc7bCro) it keeps the green and has the Obsidian underneath it, looks sick."
What�s that Blueprint ? It looks unique
"Slipper Clutch, also an AUG blueprint, is completely covered by the obsidian texture, but the turquoise main color remains, while the obsidian black is more of an accent. The most dominant AUG blueprint not only because of that, but because of its perfect iron sights."
"""He is the chosen one"""
How these watches aren't available to use for MW too in the first place is beyond me.
"Maybe with time they will unblock the watches and charms as it was done with stickers; ofcourse, if it was intended and not just another bug."
"Even though I have many more MW watches, I noticed that the WZ/CW ones are chosen more often."
why is my sens on killstreaks .0000001
Should have been like that from the get go. We haven�t had a QOL update since last summer though so I�m not holding my breath.
That would be awesome especially for warzone
Yes please
Yes please!
"It�s a must. I asked Raven on Twitter, but of course they never read my request, because I�m no big youtuber lol"
Such a shame. I don't understand why this hasn't been added yet.
Oh fuck yeah! There�s some badass skins I have but I only wanna cycle around those so this would be awesome. You should post this to the Warzone subreddit too
For favorites or random. I have mine set to random.
You know how you can favorite emblems for example? This would be the same but for operators and skins where you can set to randomize favorites so it only picks from your favorite selection.
Decoys continue to be underrated as fuck.
"A good clip to my surprise. A bunch of ppl post random bs on here a lot, was expecting you to like kill 1 or 2 guys. Decoys are underrated imo, perhaps especially in warzone but thats the other sub ik ik."
"Check my other uploads , they all are mostly stealthy crossbow kills but I use decoys in most of my videos. Iv gotten so many wild kill clips with them lol"
decoys in cold war though are the most annoying sounding useless shit i have ever used.
"I want all the losers who downvoted my post the other day when I said this happens to take a good look at this. And know that your account is just as vulnerable. 2FA won�t do shit. 


This is a perfect example of the left hand not talking to the right with Activision. When the account recovery team restores the account they should be sending a notification to the cheat review team so they know the exact timeframe the account was not within the victims possession and can discard any reports filed during that period. 

But that would require half a brain cell it seems and they�re all sharing 1/4 of one at Activision HQ so...

To answer your question, you can�t fix it. Because unless you�re some adderall infused twitch kiddie you�re not getting through to Activision to discuss the topic of bans. You even mention the word or hint at it with support and they shut down the conversation with a canned response about a thorough review process that each ban goes through and how confident they are in their procedures."
It�s always you spreading false information. He didn�t even say if he had 2fa and you assume he does which he obviously doesn�t if he got hacked. Second there was a huge false ban wave today and a lot of people that weren�t supposed to get banned got banned. Do some research before you pedal your bullshit
There was a false ban wave today so that�s the likely answer
"Because hackers are getting smarter and they know you'll get your account back in some cases. They could care less. So out of spite, I've heard some people say they purposely use cheats on the account so that even if it gets taken back, it'll be permanently banned. Some of them don't do it to sell accounts or use cosmetics, they just do it to be a dick. Whats worse is that Activision has said that they ""dont review permanent bans""."
*sniff sniff* I smell some funny shit here
"Dude I�ve been feeling the same way. My aim is all over the place right now I can�t kill anybody. I�ve had to tweak my sensitivity. I�m a 1.8kd player, not great but not a bum and now I feel like I�m going to lose every shootout."
"  Or maybe it's the precision ring that's getting softer with time.
I doubt it but it could be possible."
"Lower your sens, thats what I had to do.

I was on 19/19, had to drop to 15/15."
It looks like they recently tweaked the aim curves again going by similar reports. Just gotta keep playing to get used to it.
"They've done something their end I'm sure of it.

I was playing on 19/19 sens for months and not missing often, now that sens is far too high and I can't hit shit."
[deleted]
How does that make since?
"Seems to be a normal occurrence for some reason, I've noticed every now and then my aim will be ""worse"" Then usual, like for example last week it's like most of my shots would miss but when I came back the other day my very first game it was back to normal"
"the same thing has been happening with me. i used to be decent on 20-20, 2.0 2.0 but i had to lower it to 14-14, 0.90 0.90 because of how much more I was missing"
Tufff !
Noice
No problem
"getting this too, i go into coop, play for a bit, then get kicked out with dev error 1099"
"Are you using double XP or anything of the sort, new gun that gets ranked?"
This is happening to me too! usually after wave 27 which is soooo annoying. Why are we not getting a fix for this
Getting this on Co-op with battle pass purchased and solar flare sub machine gun equipped.
"It's happening for me too, it was reported on Activision forum too, but nobody cares.  
https://support.activision.com/community/s/question/0D54P000081EYIkSAO/dev-error-1099"
you can see nametags through that?
"I haven't tested it yet, but sometimes not only on this map. One time I remember was at Suldal Harbor, suddenly I saw couple of nametags then disappeared, it was so weird."
"Does that go to the 2nd floor of their spawn building? If so, how the fuck did you even find that wallbang? I never would've thought about that."
"I think it does, slow down the video you will see the sniper's flare and their nametag."
That nametag was filthy
"Link to the video https://youtu.be/P5JKzVte7tE, please give any suggestions on what I can improve or change around, the video is �shot� under safety precautions and all indoor footage were shot using training dummies, the �animations� I was doing were inspired by modern warfare and escape from tarkov."
"I actually had the same problem. The solution was to open the game and once it is ""connecting to servers"", you stop it and the game will launch in offline mode. Then, you try to open spec ops. It should appear on screen that you don't have it installed, and a download will start. When finished, hopefully it's working properly :)"
"Thanks, it worked!"
Have you installed all the data packs?
"Yeah, I've installed everything except the High res packs"
I similarly had the same issue. Try deleting and reinstalling only the spec ops pack 1
Are you over 18?
"Don�t know how to help you but honestly if you like mw you will hate Cold War. Good story and great zombies (I�ve always liked zombies already put 150 hours on zombies) but if your even planing on playing a hour of multiplayer DONT the graphics and significantly worse then mw, lame guns, bad boring maps, clunky and unresponsive movement. I bought it at launch and I was furious  I�ve packed 600 ish hours on mw and hate Cold War like no other. Buy what you want just watch some reviews form people not corporations and companies sorry for the rant but just take one last look if it�s worth it"
The amount of misinformation you managed to fit into this post is nothing short of fascinating.
With Blizzard you have to put in a support ticket.
Cold War is doo doo anyways
Dude shut the fuck up and let the man get help for something he wants to purchase
i cant post this?
No idea?
"This is the same exact reason I stayed with the game after the campaign and did specials ops and multiplayer. And while it seems it�s faded a bit in the realism as it kept getting updated, it was alright cause I didn�t have to dress in bright fluorescent colors but others could if they wanted."
"Modern warfare is more realistic than black ops but it's still arcade. I like the kind of ""realism-arcade"" genre of MW2019 and the original MW trilogy much more than the black ops sci-fi thing for sure though."
">Warzone is laughable at this point with the implementation of these reactive gun camos. 

But weed camo outfit and gold tracer effects are fine?

[https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/bundles/400409-the-executive-armorer](https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/bundles/400409-the-executive-armorer)

It's crazy how this subreddit is in denial like Activision didn't tell Infinity Ward/Raven to add wacky cosmetics to this game as soon as Warzone came out. Hell, we even had anime-themed guns before that.

All I'm seeing here is that you're mad a game is clearly catering to a known audience/fanbase and that you're not part of it. If you want true realism, the campaigns exist. COD multiplayer has not catered to ""realism"" in a long time. Sure you get your Mil-Sim skins every now and then, but the majority of cosmetics are flashy and nonsensical, as they have always been."
I prefer modern warfare. Better game IMO. Black ops is still fun every now and then though
"Call of duty has been an arcade shooter since like COD2. Modern Warfare, while implementing some ""realistic"" elements, is still an arcade shooter. When i play as Jigsaw, slicing people with Katanas and an riot shield plastered with anime characters strapped to my back, I can't say that the first thing that comes to my mind is ""realism""."
I think he means realistic setting and theme. Black ops ditched their theme right away. MW tried to keep its theme grounded for the most part until near the release of BO.
"I'll link this video from [LateNightGaming]9https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW2-u1W3CmM)

He makes many good points about how these weird cosmetics ruin immersion in the game. Imagine playing halo as a super soldier in space and then get your ass beat by sonic and not another super soldier.

Too many games are adding so many wacky cosmetics that they're losing their identity. Even Black Ops isn't about black operations. It works for a game like Fortnite since its identity is about bringing things from games/movies. CODs identity is a fun military shooter."
"MW is a pure arcade shooter, its just way more polished than BOCW. Dont get ne wrong MW has been one of my favorite games but if you label it as ""realistic"" better try Tarkov or Arma and think again. MW is great because its arcade done well without sacrificing polish."
"I think he means the realistic aesthetic, Not really the realistic gameplay, kinda like the original mw."
"I could not agree more. I had largely fallen out of COD after playing from COD 4 because of the direction it was going, I just thought it was too cartoony. I did what everyone tells someone to do when they complain they don't like the cartoony feel of a shooter and want something more realistic, I went to Battlefield. When Modern Warfare came out I wasn't going to buy it and it wasn't until I saw some game play and loved how good it looked. I specifically remember looking at the recoil and thinking ""They are making this look so realistic"". 

Modern Warfare was nowhere near perfect, but, like you, it was the first COD I got mastery camo in, and I have over 35 days played (chalk it up it being a really fun game and me being an unemployed grad student for a time). I could even get over the more frustrating aspects of the game like SBMM, dead silence as a specialist, map design, etc. because of how the game looked and its weapon mechanics.

 I bought Cold War without really thinking of it (I hardly ever watch prerelease videos or anything like that), and instantly regretted it. If they would have just continued to update MW19 for another year I couldn't have been happier. Oh well. Lesson learned. Until they put out another game on an engine like MW19, I just won't be buying it."
Fuck black ops
"They made Black Ops to generate a spike in revenue. They wouldn't have been able to make as much money with WZ alone. I tend to think of BO as an expensive add-on.

The integration itself is novel. A great idea but poorly executed. In regards to the skins... dude. We are slide cancelling everywhere. This is not a realistic shooter. Arma is a realistic shooter. COD has always been arcadey, IMO."
"I agree MWs campaign is amazing it�s for sure my favorite and I would also say I loved MW as a game I have around 18 days play and I have unlocked Damascus. Also I have around 15-30 days played in every cod starting with MW2. First things first is Activision trying to appeal to a younger demographic with the bright colors and stuff I would say somewhat but this isn�t the first time it�s happened Black ops games generally have a brighter color palet starting with BO2. You could wrap bacon around your gun, have element 115 flowing through your gun that sort of customization has been apart of call of duty for a while. Next you said something along the lines of warzone is laughable this isn�t what you paid for. Well you didn�t pay for Warzone, warzone is free and didn�t come out until season 3 and it wasn�t never a MW exclusive mode it was always going to integrate with the next COD. Next BOCW is COD how you compared it to HALO & Fortnite I have no clue and quite frankly BOCW is more �COD� than MW. MW is cod but BOCW is much more classic Arcady COD. Also BOCW has 3 lane maps which have been a thing forever and during MW life cycle many complained that MW needed to start doing 3 lane maps because the maps in that game are so bad. 
At the end of the day the only maps I and many people were playing were shipment and shoot house which shoot house is a perfect 3 lane map"
"I totally agree, they have an amazing game with tremendous potential and they consciously throw it in the trash."
Mw2019 Best game for me
"Yeah I definitely agree, modern warfare really seemed to be going for a more realistic modern aesthetics like the original cod 4 was going for. It felt like the most gritty and realistic cod so far. Guns felt loud and powerful, characters in the campaign sometimes use realistic tactics, and the night vision segments felt extremely realistic, cool, and tactical. 

For the first couple of seasons I really liked most of the skins, they mostly keep true to the modern aesthetic(like the milsim skins) but eventually they had to throw in couple brightly colored, and wacky skins to appeal to the more casual audience, which is ok I guess, it doesn't affect gameplay, but I'm not THAT into them."
I'm pretty sure they only added the wacky stuff cuz of pressure from Activision. At least they tried to keep their vision of a grounded game longer. BO ditched it right away.
nice. not sure if you're using the thermal scope for challenges but i'd recommend running all speed attachments on the kar and maybe keeping the monolithic suppressor if you're gonna be using it at long distances
I�ve been using the thermal scope because it�s surprisingly great at long distance with the advantage of no glint
"Fuck AS VAL in SND

All my homies use obsidian AKs"

Oden is the shit.
Oden is great

Obsidian EBR gang approves this post
"I love the EBR, first DMR I got gold.

It's so underrated, people just don't see it's greatness."
"Oof that's rough, that gun just does not agree with me, as soon as I got it gold I never touched it again lol"
"Jeez I have the legendary version from S4 still equipped,it is probably the most beautiful gun in the game"
"What I love about the AK is that you can use it in basically any role that is not shotgunning or sniping.

Want a heavy assault rifle? Standard AK. Light rifle? 5.45mm AK. Light Machine Gun? Build an RPK. Want a SMG-like rushing monster? AKs-74u.

The only gun that is as versatile as the AK is the M4."
Now see i like to choose my obsidian crossbow or rytec over ARs cuz i have no ars obsidian. I've got the p90 and the 725 (725 for when i feel like being cancerous)
Chad micro scar enjoyers
Haven�t touched the AS Val ever since I unlocked it
Why? Its incredibly powerful
Thing is irl the Val is one of my favourite guns but I feel bad using it
"i feels the same, thing is disgustingly OP"
based bring me the horizon
"this song is good, but Pray for Plagues is my favorite from them."
People sleep on the ak too much the gun is a beast
"At ~64K kills on mine. Do I stop using it once I get to 69,420 kills?!

It's my go to gun for anything...
Taking on snipers? Iron sight AK.
CQC? AK.
Other AK's? AK.

I love winning CQC fights with this. Especially if they have a VAL. Then I LOL hard when they bitch and say ""Stop using an AK you sweat""... coming from MP5/VAL users!"
Tarkov in a nut shell
Can you feel my heart? Upvoted
Cr-56 amax and oden fans are the true chads of the game no cap
"11k amax kills clocking in


by far my favorite gun"
"amax is borderline OP, no one realised that until like 2 months ago"
The cr-56 amax is one of the best guns in the game what are you on about?
"My AK is almost Obsidian. I think I'm at like 125/200.

The VAL is one of four guns I haven't touched"
My only obsidian gun to this day
"I've got the ak, scar, m91 mg34 mk2 kar and Hdr(but I'm almost done with that) left for Damascus, can someone drop an order for me to do it from most ass to do in hardcore to easiest please
Incase this effects your decision: My aim isnt the best, and I tend to prefer a run and gun play style so the snipers are taking me put of my comfort zone a bit, the lmgs are fun from what I've played with them, I havent tried the scar yet, but I've used the black cat blueprint with the AK but with the original barrel instead and it's been a lot of fun, the scar is gonna be eeh, I'm not the biggest fan of slower Ars (fal famas oden scar ak without 5.56 mags) but I think it'll be better than the snipers
Also for OP, I'm grinding the HDR in hardcore atm, and I have a strong hate for people that use either the ak or the as val, I'm really disliking anyone that uses an automatic/semi automatic weapon atm, but it's better now than it was doing reptile, that was hell"
"the MG 34 will be the most annoying, followed by the HDR, Kar and MK2 (some of the challenges are annoying due to the firing speeds.  the MK 2 will be the easiest in hardcore).  

&#x200B;

m91 no stock is mostly AR levels of mobility and hits hard in HC.  the Scar and AK are about the same and will be easy mode in HC."

AK and AMAX are obsidian for me. Working on the bruen now
VAL users usally have beanbag brains anyways.
Isn�t the CR-56 basically identical to the AK but has better range?
"Kiiinda. It actually shoots faster than the AK, but it drops off to a 4-shot kill at range, while the AK is always a 3-hit to the chest. The AK is also always a two tap to the head, while the AMAX becomes a 3-hit headshot. So the AK is definitely better at long range, but for close-medium engagements the AMAX is crazy good"
where my 5.45 gang at?
i got plat ar's and the ak is pretty solid
FN Scar 17 gang
The Val is good and the ak is good..  I�m a better person than you.
Facts here
SA87 Gang.
I'd rather be the guy on the left
All I need is an m4 and a knife
I just like the val because it's legitimately one of my favourite rl guns
Wtf did I walk in on?
mans playing katana zero in 3d
I�m I streaming this on a fucking tv from the 90�s
lmfao why is your game deep fried
"I don�t think it looks bad, I use nvidia sharpness and detail settings and Reddit lowers the quality of the video as well."
sheesh
That was insane
This game is so �realistic�. Nice gameplay bro.
Cocaine's a hellva drug
"Yeah, the bullet eating is fucking ridiculous, cant even play warzone unless they are either standing completely still or running towards me because of the lag"
Fr every game is a jittery stuttering mess its terrible. I can barely enjoy games anymore just bc I die to things outside my control
"Mate, this morning I had so much lag it was unplayable, right now I can't even log into the fucking game lmao."
"Same, I only launch it now to use my 200 2xp tokens for cold war and apparently the servers are down"
I have typed this in between reloading.
My PS4 pro just started doing this exact same thing.
Can't play SnD
I stopped playing Modern Warfare when Cold War came out. It was fun and extremely enjoyable with lag every now and then. I�ve since tried coming back twice in the past couple of months and the PACKET LOSS is out of fucking control. Every game is a jittery mess. This game is unplayable for me right now. Cold War has ZERO packet loss so its definitely on Activision�s end.
"Yeah, cold war runs smooth ass hell for me while mw on the other hand is like a donkey falling down a flight of stairs"
"Yeah lol always, server problem or?"
"that's some server dying on you. seems they brought over some coldwar servers for mw.

it's rare for me though, i only had 2 servers like that in MP, although a few more in WZ"
Every game is laggy for mw not Cold War tho. It runs smooth as hell
"Same here. Have a bangin pc I just got (3070 and 3700x) and this is happening, super frustrating cause I just downloaded the game and want to make sure I know if it�s server issues or my pc"
"Try another game and see if the problem persists. Easiest way to isolate the problem to COD.

Last time I tried BF1 and had *zero* issues. I�m assuming this time it�s the same, because my ping, packet loss, and bandwidth are all fine."
Yeah been having packet loss for a few days now on pc.
"My problem was packet burst, not packet loss - subtle difference.

My packet burst issue was actually resolved after power cycling all my network devices (router, powerline adapters etc). So this time I was wrong to blame the game"
"Not bad, but how of them had just spawned and had no idea someone was there? Spawn camping is the lowest form of kill."
"Make a YouTube channel, link it to your PS4, upload your clips to YouTube, download your clips on your computer."
"Nice shooting, what pistol loadout is that?"
There's like 6 bundles slated for season 1 we never got I'm starting to give up hope
"I�ve had horrible experiences that seem like connection issues. I checked if it was my computer by doing a private match, and no issues there - so I don�t think it�s a computing issue or anything. I�ve seen people complaining about the servers or that this started with last thursday/tuesdays update. If this continues I�m going to uninstall the game (just bought it two days ago)

Hoping for a fix with tomorrow�s update (assuming they still do tuesday updates)

Edit: my wifi is good, I get 50-80mbps for download sped and 50-80mbps for upload speed

I�m on pc as well, this doesn�t seem to be a console issue

Edit 2: it could also be an issue with my motherboard and it�s wireless card, but that is unlikely"
"I love p90, i got that obsidian pretty quick, the mk2 is great i used to use it all the time but once i started using other snipers and marksmans i lost track of how to use it"
Okay
I don't really rate the VAL. I have the Malpass \[sp\]? blueprint and I do a lot better with almost any other AR.
the most as val wanna be tryhards dont use the stock blue print \^\^�
I guess the AS VAl is kinda GAY!
Auto-aim??
yeah the game implemented aimbot (just tune the settings and people abuse it)  i test it and its aim rly instant on the head from the enemy i have record it btw too
"The SP-R needs addressed before the Val. I'm sick of that thing. I don't even like my teammates using it. Boom, Boom, Boom, gonna make me lose my mind."
"the only problem is the auto aim mush people abuse it.  
this people attach no scope or a short scope to get it and yeah auto aim aims most times on the head instant this problems have the kar 98 to but i feel you bro but i like the spr but not the abusing people. infinity ward must deactivate aim assist on sniper and dmr full and the problem is gone"
The nerf is the magazine size
Ye not really it needs more recoil or lower damage Something Like this
Not really no.
"As much as i hate to say this, i don't think it will. 

Don't get me wrong, i'm a slut for the as val ever since day 1, i got bored of the MP5, came back to MW MP and i didn't realize it was so overused by players, i didn't know it was a meta in the first place, idk if its me but whenever i liked a certain weapon, it'll get nerfed to the ground and that sucks. (Renetti & SPR :/ )

But to see it nerf? Unlikely, probably because the gun itself is already nerfed due to the magazine size to begin with, however, even if it was to get a nerf on either the TTK or the amount of time to kill someone, IW has to make another 40 round attachment for the as val due to the damage drop off.

So in a sense, the gun is already stable the way it is. 

I've realize that each MW weapons has it's pro's and cons while i was getting damascus. 

I'm gona get alot of hate from this but that's just my opinion. 

And how warzone is right now, it's reallt annoying that most CW weapons outclass and out power MW weapons."
the other problem is mp5 thats true but the as val needs lower damage or a lower fire rate something like that and rennetti got nerfed :( and the spr problem its only presence with autoaim users (just a patch is need to disable autoaim full on dmrs and snipers then its fine)
�Ma fuckin� gun�s broke�

Sorry Bro Warzone Is so boring....
No problema bro
Damn that dude got turned on nice work
Balkan bundle also got m4a1 blueprint with the best clean m4 iron sight!
"Nice, I will buy it because the ebr is meh"
It's just the standard iron sight tho... I got it because of the STANAG mag and everything's black on it.
"Stealth, all the way"
"cool, thanks for the tip"
"Balkan, easily the best cheap operator"
"Alright, thanks for the advice"
All black
"Alright then, black it is"
Where do you get the bundles for both of those operators?
you can find them in the armory or just search on YT how to find old bundles
"Right one, look for M4A1 Thunderclap in armoury"
Balkan blue is best bundle buy that
"alright man, thanks for that!"
My account got hacked in December. Shortly after my bank account had 4 internet shopping charges that I didn't make. Bank manager told me not to keep my credit card info saved on the playstationnetwork . If you have a bank account...keep an eye on it.
"Thanks I will, does the above link work for you or is it just me?"
"My account got hacked two months ago, and the guy got my account banned, so activ refused to even look at my account, I had alot of rare calling cards, nuke card, and I was a top player, last time I quit cod, they can't keep doing this to us."
"I had the same thing happen to me 2 weeks ago. I lost all of my shit. Still waiting on Acti to get back to me. 

Luckily I didn�t lose money, but I lost all of my game data. My damascus camo, my obsidian, my 40 days of in game time, all the bundles, and all the shit I started doing in Cold War. It blows man."
"Just got my Activision account comprimised. all my platform accounts got unlinked and a unknown battlenet account got linked, that i cant unlink for some reason. This is a first in my life to be fair. good job activision."
"Info that I can provide you with is to always add 2 factor verification, if it is not enabled and someone does get in to your account you will not get it back."

Obvious joke ^

I haven't had this issue. I play on xbox one and ps5, and no issues on either side so far. Maybe check Activision Status to see if their servers are having issues in certain countries?"
when this happens to me I just restar the game at least 2 times and it works im on xbox one s and I don't have this issue so its not the mw servers
"In Pc what it works for me it's:
1) Restart battle.net and the game
2) Restart Router
Sometimes 3) Restart pc (instead of 2)

I follow that chain and it's always fixed (except two times that was a global issue)"
All the time!!!
I just swap my router for my 56k modem and dial in. It seems much more stable.
Does motion blur affect gameplay or is it only for graphics?
I turn it off tbh.
Looks fun. My man was popping off
"I hate it and love it at the same time. Feels great to snipe and def feels better than the CW counter part but getting bopped by some nerd with a 338 SPR while on a killstreak fucking sends me bc there is nothing you can do. If he hits, you die. If he misses you win, you could be the best player in the world and still die to some random sniping just bc he flicked in your general direction"
the Spr is a sniper with training wheels. I am not wrong. Still a very good clip though. Nice shots
Its mad addicting! So satisfying when you in the grove. Ax-50 is my go to for MP but adjusting to the Kar cause Warzone quick scopes are nasty af with it and more ADS
Overkill AX-50/Explosive Tip Crossbow is sooooo fun and unique that it always has people scratching their heads.
"Definitely, not sure why you dont have more upvotes. People on Reddit seem to be really easily offended or just simply non supportive of people. I thought twitter was toxic until i saw that people downvote every single thing on here for no reason"
The mw Reddit community are the biggest bunch of crybabies! Nice shots dude!
"Tbh, this is exactly what I hate about MW. 70% of my deaths are ridiculous sniper rifles that have faster ads speeds than ARs and one shot you. You have no chance against them. I know, ""git gud"", but I ain't trying to sweat 24/7 playing this."
It is annoying getting panic shot with a spr or kar.
"""Sniping"""
This isnt sniping... this is using a bolt action rifle for close range fighting.
You�re the type of guy to swear at people for camping with a sniper but then tell a quickscoper that they aren�t sniping properly. How about you post a clip of you using a sniper �properly�
"actual sniping gameplay. man, I love snipers and respect tf outta people who use them in game but of you use Spr or Kar I literally have none for you. Those to �marksman rifles� are ridiculous and can�t stand being in lobbies with some sound whoring nerd using them"
"Great clip! I am glad MW allows skilled snipers to make sequences like this.

I do wish there were playlists for players like myself with no sniper/ or marksman class. Taking the quickscope mechanic (some may say it is super broken) out of the match makes a whole different feel  which I would like to play.  I am not saying take QS out of the game, just make a little corner of the game where people don�t have to deal with it."
cold war i guess
Why don�t I get lobby�s like this
"Nice shooting!! I gave up trying to get better at quick scoping. This makes me want to give it another crack. Like the other post says, I just don't get the lobbies to put quick scoping into action. Last night with a Grau was rough. Everyone hiding in windows, crevices, corners, etc.. Quick scoping just wouldn't be the lick in those circumstances. I was getting better at it during the sniper only gunfight playlists."
"Here's something i found useful for the Ax and the HDR when i was going for platinum on these weapons. set up either of these like so: 


tac laser

You want either one of the 3x scopes(i prefer the Cronen) and any reticle of your choosing (i like the straight crosshair, the 3rd or 4th one - can't remember)

Whichever stock has aim down sight improvement.


you should be super quick with aiming with the aforementioned snipers with these attatchments."

"Yeah that�s disgusting, I don�t see the satisfaction in winning while cheating."
"Am I missing something, or does he just see you through the tent, not because of hacking, but because your guy gun and body sticks out?"
The instant double headshot through the tent from me and my teammate? Does he really shoot us in the head or does he shoot the tent and it�s just a headshot.
"According to wiki, Captain Price was based off of multiple people, but his first appearance in 2007 in COD 2 was based on Captain Jimmy Cleminson from A Bridge too Far. His later appearance and design in the Modern Warfare series (MW, MW2, MW3) is based on real life John McAleese, a Scottish SAS soldier known among many things for his involvement in the storming of the Iranian embassy in London in the 80�s"
Cpt Price was in original CoD 2003 too. It was confusing him to see when Modern Warfare came out later in 2007(8).
Wow John McAleese has the moustache and everything
Captain Price was most likely based on John Macaleese from the SAS team who ended the Iranian Embassy Siege. I�m pretty sure he was... but after the kiddie porn allegations that came out about Macaleese later in life they probably want to distance themselves from the comparison.
"The first appearance of him was in the campaign for Call of Duty 2003. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_(video_game)

Another user correctly identified who he�s based on."
Idk
Just use your birthday money
My birthday is in June. Not helpful.
I'm surprised that this map still isn't in the game
I�ve been waiting for Terminal & Highrise. They made Hardhat all using reused Assets I�m sure they can muster up something :(
"Seemed like a wasted opportunity to not only have Invasion included, but also a GW map of Euphrates combined with Invasion."
100% they just used some LOD assets from MW2 to add a background city rather than making one from scratch.
Saving it for MW2 2022
"Invasion was never that great.  Still, it was better than fucking hardhat.  That map was always trash."
"Wtf I�ve never even seen this. 

I wish they added more maps to the game."
"They probably wanted to, but Activision made it pretty clear that as soon as CW launched, MW�s budget would be slashed to minimal. 

Now, that doesn�t excuse the way they handled maps during their year, but it�s why we won�t see more remakes/remasters for MW even if the devs want to."
"So close... It's like they're trolling us. Very disappointed in the lack of ""classic map experiences"" they promised after not remastering MW2 MP"
"Where is Afghan, Derail, Favela, Quarry, Estate, Skidrow and Sub Base? Those were maps back then. Also miss getting tubed in the midsection of Wasteland."
"I mean to be fair we did get crash vacant rust shipment hardhat backlot and I'm missing a few iirc.  Granted, most of those are cod4 maps, but they're still classic maps"
I'd rather they just make good maps instead of porting old good maps.
Fun fact: invasion was actually pulled content from COD4 multiplayer!
Got any source on that?
The biggest let down of MW2019 is how they handled maps. All these hours in and I feel like I can barely play any of the new maps unless it is an event.
"Even the classic maps play different than I remember. They didn�t really compensate for the newer movement mechanics this has over the previous cod�s. 

That�s why in CW nuketown spawns feel worse because movement is a lot faster than BO1"
"Broadcast is the worst map I�ve ever played. In dom, the team that starts at C has a fucking staircase right up to B and plenty of walls to just sit behind once they cap it. 

That map is the way worse than Piccadilly"
Thats because their core map design philosophy sucks and as a result every single map they design and don't just directly port in from an older cod is literally unplayable for more than two games in a row before you want to turn the xbox off
"I actually believe that a lot of these areas are for a urzikstan WZ map. Think about all the POI they would have by combining Afghan from MW2, the caves from MW2019. Crash, invasion, backlot, Euphrates bridge; bog, and all the other desert maps they have; plus you could have like rust in a corner and overall just a really nice different style play than the verdansk or CW map will be."
Maybe that will be the MW2022 Warzone map!
"holy shit you might be onto something for MW2, when it makes  warzone 2"
Please just add multiplayer to MW2R
With a MW3 remake basically already existing and sitting collecting dust I bet they cut that multiplayer too sadly.
I miss Euphrates Bridge. It�s never in the rotation anymore. I miss sniping and launching the JOKR. I miss a lot of things in life I guess. Sigh.
Are you playing the 10V10 playlists? I play Euphrates Bridge at least once every day I play MW.
You alright bro?
"> I miss a lot of things in life I guess. Sigh.

It really do be like that sometimes"
"It's definitely better in your memories than in reality. Unless it's 10v10, I'm leaving when that map comes up"
I also love this map even though it�s hated by others.
It�s in the 10v10 rotation and works well for that mode IMO.
I completely forgot about invasion. that was a good one
Almost all MW2 maps were. Only one I didn't like was Rundown
"I�m over here wondering why they never remade Highrise even once, yet they�ve re-done Terminal multiple times for different cod games."
Maybe it's just me but I always thought High Rise kinda sucked
they have so many resources to bring back all this and that but theyre just sitting on it.. what a shame
This was found like since launch.
"I know, I posted this almost two years ago but I�m reposting it for newer viewers who may have not known. Neat little detail."
Just put all the god damn mw2 maps in mw! Its what we want
"Whenever you buy a bundle, it has only ever given the blueprint, not the whole gun unfortunately. As for the challenge progress, that�s strange. Just to humour me what game mode are you playing while doing this?"
"Thank You for answering to me :)  
\---  
TDM, kill confirmed on core playlist,   
only those two cos they have fast respawns and ppl dont camp as much like in other obj based modes.  
Also went on Hardcore playlist few minutes ago, played one match , got 3 gunbutt kills, no progress.  
\---

"""" *it has only ever given the blueprint, not the whole gun unfortunately.  """"*  
I think You are wrong, if i remember correctly -  buying |*Notice me anime something|* boundle for Striker 45,  unlocked it for me instantly.  
(*because i missed most of season 2 in MW*)  
I also bought Finn by |*Mainframe*| boundle then level it on shipment and run with it in Warzone with tacL, longshot adverse and saw stock.  
 I have never made any challenges for these weapons to get them"
"this is going to be difficult without shipment, but you can use any AR AFAIK.

Put breacher device on for 1 hit kills and DON'T use throwing knives as they will make you knife when melee instead of gun butt"
" Honestly, I've already given up.   
After a long break, I forgot how people are hardcore camping level 9999 turbo giga bunker masters in this game.    
Claymores/BB on dors, trophy inside room, mounted on window frame or some ferniture inside dark room with roze/ghost skin...   
I dont need AMAX that bad t to go through these torments  :D"
I'm just trying to figure out how you posted both an image and text in your post :)
"Shift+Win Key+ S  ingame, selected what i wanted, then jumped to reddit, created new post, ctrl+V, Shift+Enter to skip from picture description to normal text."
I got the game fairly recently and a few weeks ago I decided to try and unlock the AMAX. Definitely not for 3 games in a row but I would often get like 4 or 5 AR gunbutt kills in a game and not have it count towards my progress. Did you try relaunching the game and trying for gunbutt kills again?
"If you left lobbies early, it might be because of that that stops it from counting.  It hasn't happened when amax first came out, but for previous guns it didn't count if you left lobbies early, or it counted the first one, but the next three wont count.  Game is weird.

acti/iw never allowed people to unlock weapons by bundle purchases, you can max level the gun while it's still locked while using it, but it'll still be locked until you do the challenge to unlock it.  

It could very well be the game/server being buggy and not counting the unlock as well."
" the problem turned out to be the individual weapons .   
 All the games that I played I played until the end  .  
 Found out that AsVal, kilo141, m13 does not work towards completition idk why.  
When i switched to RAM i had my first count 1/10."
When you leave cave ?
Bruh moment for him.
Monke
"Its a known bug atm but there's no word on when to expect a patch. Also, im sure you're already aware but just in case, you know that most of the items in the battlepass are CW/WZ only right? Just asking sine you mentioned the battlepass and skins in the MW sub."
Lets just say I had a few bad experiences in the CW and Warzone sub
You using weapon xp token or regular? It works fine for me either way??
"Can confirm this is true, was leveling up the FiNN in multiplayer to get the chainsaw stock. Popped a double weapon xp but it still rewarded the same amount of Xp as before"
mine just disappeared when i popped it
"Got the same thing! It also continuously rotate the same bundles without much variation which results in the bundles you want (in my case ENLISTED) not showing up for at least months... also if you look at the store blueprints for specific weapons, M13 for example, it shows the same list of certain blueprints for months without any rotation/ addition. Why not add all weapon blueprints to each specific weapon for example?"
Months???? Im screwd TT
When iw wants buddie
"Wrong sub. This is not a MW weapon.  


you want:  
r/CODWarzone  
r/blackopscoldwar"
"Thank you, I posted there"
"ay man i think you better post this in r/CODWARZONE or r/blackopscoldwar, Mac-10 isn't a modern warfare thing"
Also this is r/modernwarfare not r/blackopscoldwar
"So i got my Mac-10 to lvl 52 without unlocking anny of the camo's? The count on all the criteria is stuck and not going up.Other guns seem to be working fine.  
Annyone know why this is happening?"
Its stuck
r/codwarzone or r/blackopscoldwar
"Got the same thing! It also continuously rotate the same bundles without much variation which results in the bundles you want (in my case ENLISTED) not showing up for at least months... also if you look at the store blueprints for specific weapons, M13 for example, it shows the same list of certain blueprints for months without any rotation/ addition. Why not add all weapon blueprints to each specific weapon for example?"
I think it's something the integration fucked up because before I used to have all blueprints at least in my armory or the store tab for whatever gun I looked at but now it shows 4 or less blueprints for a gun
Also the vault packs didn't appear for some people because of that integration
Exactly
I believe it�s every Thursday along with the playlist change
I mean they added a new pack today but watch the rest of my bundles still being the same. I just want a specific golum bundle from season 1

You gotta re download the whole game bro
I already did mate. It just finished downloading a few hours ago. But thanks for attempting to help :))
" The **Special Ops** section of **Modern Warfare** can be a little hard to find. You'll need to head into the Co-Op section of the main menu, where you'll be able to select a **Spec Ops** mission to **play** through. You can **play** this solo or in a group, just create a room and then start the match."
"Yeah the problem is that when I try to access coop, it says I have missing packs. And I can�t find the packs in the game installs."
game settings ; input method
It doesn�t let me pick controller even though the computer recognizes them. I already tried all that. Shit makes no sense
Thats good stay on Keyboard
Is steam open? Try closing it and rebooting the game
Okay
The dualsense 5 controller doesn't have official support on pc for warzone yet. Idk why but it frustrated me enough to get an xbox controller instead.
How do you make the game look so colourful and clear?
Nvidia filters. I got my settings from an icemanisaac vid
You may have been hacked. Same happened to me. Did you completely reset like a new account?
"No, I still have the same gamertag and the last 400 cod points  that I never spent."
You were hacked. Very common if you check the sub. Contact Activision support ASAP and get the account recovery process started. Hope you're able to get it back man.
You had damascus in just 20+ hours playtime?
I think he meant days.
I got Damascus in a hour with a 15min xp token Lolol some people believe thier own lies
"Like others said contact activision Support and also enable 2 factor authentication. Lots of activision Accounts get hacked, it is absolutely necessary to use 2fa"
"At least you still have your name.. I lost everything (obsidian skins for a few guns, purchased battlepass unlocks, operators etc etc) and even my name was reset! Strangely my COD points are still in tact. I've put an account recovery request in so hopefully they can get it all back."
"Yea, I lost 3 1/2 seasons of operator/weapon skins.

I also got to keep the remaining 400 cp that I had unspent"
Same issue on ps4 expect the whole game crashes. Seems to be issues with certain maps. Can play some split screen then others crash as soon as it starts to load
"I�ve heard that it�s been an issue across all platforms? Maybe I�m wrong? At first I thought, �Man, they are really trying to push the Cold War sale�, until I saw that split screen has been a consistent complaint on that game as well. We were able to play 1-2 matches at a time after 4+ attempts at joining a match, and getting kicked out."
"It�s been a known and ongoing issue for month. The match will start loading in, then the screen will freeze and you�ll be booted back to your console home screen. Affects both Xbox and PS players. My girlfriend and I used to play together most nights each week. Used to be our �end of day, just wanting to hang out and relax� kind of thing for after works and all, but now we�re lucky if even 50% of game we try to play just kick us back to the home screen.

Sadly, people have been posting about it over on their support forums for months and, to my knowledge, not a single one got addressed with any response. They absolutely know about it, and have no doubt seen the numerous complaints on their support forums, but at this point, MW isn�t the new game that�s going to get continued dev support for issues that only affect a small portion of the game�s player base. Unfortunately, it seems they broke their own game while trying to force CW down our throats, and they have absolutely zero intention of fixing it, nor acknowledging it"
To be fair CW split screen doesn't work either. Don't think its worked since launch
After two months it is finally a �known issue� by Activison - https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/known-issues-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare
"Got the same issue, it was recently added to the list of known issues (took a month at least)
https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/known-issues-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare
Hopefully they will fix it for a coming update.

Personally, the only ""temporary"" fix I found was to do LT while being in the lobby after each game on player 2 and to go to Battle Pass section, as the issue is related to exp points and Battle Pass exp points not being added to this player. This allows Player 2 to unlock his exp points and to be able to play few games in a row.
It's not working 100% of the time, but at least it allows to play few games, before needing to restart the Xbox.

Can't wait for this to be fixed, if you want to report the bug and help showing them it's not only a few people having this issue, report it here : https://www.cvent.com/d/yyqfvy"
I�m glad I found this... I have been raising high hell with Activision since January and I didn�t realize they finally added to the list of known issues. Thanks for posting!
I have same problem on PS5 30/31 games Crash
"THAT IS SO FRUSTRATING. I�m sorry!!! Are you on split screen, or just single player?"
"Cold War is even worse, I tried Playing split screen zombies last night with my buddy and not only was it laggy asf but all the cars were 5X their actual speed which was really fucking weird... tried to play split screen multiplayer and everyone was invisible including ourselves yet everyone else had no problem seeing and shooting us, got pissed off at invisible people till the game just up and crashed and I gave up.. kinda feel like they�re making split screen unplayable on purpose though, they want every single person to go buy their own console and copy of the game, they don�t want you to be able to go to your friends and play for free so why not just make it unplayable lmao GO ACTIVISION GO!!!!"

"I really appreciate the reply. And of course, anyone who even reads my post. 

Unfortunately, I know how to connect to play split screen on one console, but there has been a huge glitch occurring lately. It worked perfectly with our xbox one until they came out with a new season. Now, we can�t get into a game on split screen without immediately getting kicked :("
"Solid work Ghost Rider, return to base"
"because this game is held together by duct tape and spit, you have no idea how much time of my life i will never get back dealing with error code DIVER and a multitude of dev errors in warzone"
It�s crazy with how much money they make. Maybe they need to get away from every year. Or add a studio nor something
Slamming a 70-round magazine onto a weapon does not make it a LMG. LMGs are about providing accurate and continuous suppressing fire to support your teams advance. This thing is a carbine at best. It is however quite an effective loadout in maps like shipment :D (I used that a few times).
I have same problem nothink fix
this clip put gas in my tank
Great gameplay dude! But that title might aswell just say �cringe beep beep bop cringey mmmm cringe�
"Thanks man! Haha yeah that's totally fair, I'm a cringy person with negative creativity. I'll give myself a gold star for being me on the internet."

"Honestly think the perk slot shouldn�t count and should be like the �card� feature in black ops. 
FMJ sometimes isn�t worth a slot, but anytime I don�t have it is when I need it. Same with sleight of hand or the extra ammo. It�s not that OP to have, so why even make it take a slot?"
Activision only cares about money
Lol
*ba dum tss*
Weapon setup ?
"Resonant AK-47 blueprint 

Muzzle= lightweight suppressor
Barrell= spetsnaz elite
Optic= gi mini 
Underbarrel= operator foregrip
Ammunition=40 round mag"
Is this satire?
Lmao it�s semi ironic. Obviously this play sucked but i did think that the one kill i did get was neat.
"On the obsidian grind the counter sometimes dont count even when you way past 15 kills with that weapon.  I had that, then the next game had a great game with def potg to specialist streak, then all of a sudden DC.

2 games wasted, if anyone has done off meta obs grind you'd know how frustrating it can be just losing progress without DC but the DC daily is...  worst thing is I cant even fucking quit."
Yeah it�s annoying especially when trying to  get the obsidian crossbow. I�ve been stuck in the 40s the last few days
We get booted all of the time when playing Hardcore Team Death Match as a multiplayer split screen.
My guy spazzed
"The release maps were dog shit, can�t change my mind. The maps they added later on were pretty good, good remakes and some good new maps that they made."
"I don't know man, I really don't enjoy oil rig/so dull harbour and wank factory + broadcast (maybe I'm just traumatized by the spr and asval usage of that specific playlist). So, if I'm not having fun on them, I just dont play them. Unfortunately they show up all the time in the quick game option. We need proper permanent playlist, it just won't happen."
"I�m with you. I enjoy all the maps, even Piccadilly and Euphrates Bridge. 

Most of the people who complain about the maps really just suck and haven�t figured out how to adapt."
Mw maps >>>> strict 3 lane maps
What about Raid? There has to be at least a few exceptions. Most mw maps were trash.
yup the best thing about mw is the whole parkour aspect
HAHA LOL!!!!! WHEN THE WALL IS SUS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA LOLOLOLOLOL
"It�s different because COD is a competitive shooter, and MW has the best movement and gunplay which you can�t really deny."
"> COD is a competitive shooter 
 
No it�s not. This is a casual shooter with a SUPER low skill gap. �Competitive� cod is just normal pubs with a banlist. There�s nothing competitive about it. Plus this game�s ttk is shoot first die first. It doesn�t even reward actual aiming which is probably the one thing in this game that requires skill.
 
Cod isn�t popular for it�s competitive scene. Your average player probably doesn�t even know that cdl exists."
Well polish is important. It�s just that this game you can feel the effort and care and that means a lot to a consumer
"Just based on the numbers alone, MW19 is better. That�s just facts. The numbers show. You can�t argue that bud. Compare it to CW and all previous COD. MW19 is still pulling the best numbers. CW is the newer game and MW19 is doing better still."
Is this true? I want any excuse at this point to drop cold war. I fucked my rank up so bad in league play tonight.
"Depends on what you mean for better. For me better means that it rewards skill. Since most of the players barely know how to shoot straight, it's pretty obvious to me that the CoDs with low skill gaps (the worst CoDs) will have a higher population, it happened with Bo3 for instance."
I think 3 is the best gta. 4 and 5 sucked imo.
"The reason people see 5 as the best is because despite the story's limits, there is an entire online mode, that is clearly far better than 4's online"
"iirc it's a button on the select operator screen, not in the missions menu."
Checked there too... Still have no idea. I've pressed every button on my controller...
"You don�t own any missions, since his only mission was in season 1"
So I'm locked out of his missions and skins forever?
I bought my game a good 6 months after release and now I�m going back to unlock a few old missions For each skin that I never got around to .  I feel it�s broken. .  For example my progress for a golem (use field upgrade 5 times ) doesn�t work.  It just stays at 0/5.  I feel like parts of game are abandoned tinge Cold War release last November
"I had same issue. I found out that they are propably locked forewer. 

  
I dont know if its true or not but somone told me that operator missions are now unlocked only for Battlepass operators. That means now are avaliable missons for operator that you get from battlepass and you can unlock skins on them and it will be locked when new season comes out."
"Some of the basic skins are available through operator missions which you should be able to select when viewing them.  Others can be obtained through the co-op special ops section which unlock the base skins.
Every now and then you will find bundles which unlock different skins for the operators from past seasons but I haven�t seen any from season 1 as of yet.

Hope that helps."
I can�t find enough player to start the coop mission...
You should always get ground killstreaks out of the way first for the launchers. The regular kills are easy. The jokr is more of a pain than the rpg imo for ground because people LOVE destroying counter uavs and personal uavs with their guns while you wait for a 30 hour missile to land.
Jokr on shoot house with any objective especially hard point is easy money for kills. Also I believe if I recall correctly (got it gold a long time ago) you can get enough distance to shoot it on shipment if your back to the wall aiming to the other.
I like how you have optics on your dual wields it makes them look so cool ngl.
Happens with knife too if I try ADS too fast after switching it sucks
It happens to me aswell when switching from the knife and kali sticks but I have been thinking that they keep it like that on purpose to slow the player down causing you to wait for your gun to pop up
"I'm pretty sure it's not on purpose. If they wanted to intentionally slow the player down when switching from sticks to a gun, then they would have just made the animation slower, so the ADS would still happen but it would just take a bit longer to come up.

This is a clear order-of-input glitch � it might make sense for them to purposely make it so if you accidentally hit ADS *before* weapon switch then it just ignores the weapon switch, as it's already accepted the input for the melee. But what's happening here is it accepts the input for the weapon switch, then instead of queuing the ADS input, the ADS input breaks the action it's already accepted and started.

That's definitely a glitch (or design oversight), not an intentional feature."
MW is by far the best cod to have come out in many years and the game engine makes it so much more fun to play
"It has the best engine ever, but it�s lack luster in a lot of other parts of the game."
"Easily. I think MW is the best modern day CoD, especially if you're just now getting into it."
The only ones I've played are BO4 and CW. One is dead on pc and the other isn't very fun.
I just bought MW a few days ago after not playing CoD for 3-4 years.   Chose it over CW and not regretting it
"Hope I'm not too late, but, as always with ""Is Modern Warfare (2019) worth buying"" questions, try warzone out first to see if you'll like some aspects of the multiplayer such as gunplay, base mechanics, teamwork, weapons, etc. Otherwise, you'd just be spending 45 dollars on a cool campaign."
"Just be aware that the Battlepass is No longer available on MW , you will be wasting your money. The only available Battlepass is by playing Cold War."
They removed the season 2 battle pass from MW?
I wouldn�t pay $44 for it. I have a LOT of hours on the game. I�m brand new to this sub. You should ask around elsewhere regarding people�s opinions of the game. Everyone�s gonna just circle jerk it here in this sub
"I�m a HUGE fan of MW (I prefer IW to Treyarch too), but this guy is right. The game is good, but being $45 is a bit much for last year�s title. 

I personally would buy it, but that�s because I�m a huge MW series fan. If you�re not, the price is probably too high."
"Worth, but the only problem with MW is so many cheaters...and Activision just lets them go."
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I mean if you want the game get it! It�s just money. You�ll get more than 45$ worth of fun out of it I guarantee you that. I�ve been playing it casually since it came out and it�s still just as fun. Still you can still grab bundles and everything so it�s easy to catch up.
"The game deserves it, the way developers are treating it at the moment no."
Absolutely. Just avoid Warzone and turn off cross play so you don't have to deal with cheaters.
sure.
"If you're REALLY fucking good, prepare to try your ass off every game unless you're fine with barely going positive. $BMM is still a thing, and there's no ranked game mode for tryhards to go to. If you want to get killstreaks and are good at the game, prepare to try your ass off."
I�m a very casual player and still rip on this game. It is very fun! The community is great. A bit of campers now but the game itself is still very solid. Full lobbies. Haven�t even thought about getting Cold War
Yes its way better then cold war
"I wouldn't. It's soon to be just like CoD WW2: abandoned and full of hackers. I'd say it's got a good 6 months left, however. And to anyone who disagrees, the pattern has been telepathed for years: that is MW's fate."
You can get it on Amazon or Ebay for $25-35. And yes
Yes. It is way better then Cold War
"Modern Warfare is the best.
I everyday playing modern Warfare and enjoy.
I have no problems with Looby and matchmaking .
Still It has many players. and very better than CW..."
yes theres a lot of content for $45
"I�d say on console without crossplay, on PC I encounter so many hackers that I makes me somewhat like the SBMM on cold war. Seriously playing mostly HC, the difference between both games is huge. I can live with the numerous campers in MW but someone with an aimbot and/or a wallhack kind of ruin the game for everyone."
I don�t think so but you can try and re-download the app
Yeah. Been this way forever. Playing with randos will just always be this way. On the bright side you enjoy even more those rare magical games where a team of total strangers works together and executes a brilliant Dom win.
"The best is when you have two (non-partied) factions really playing strategically. B is an absolute slaughterhouse the entire match, you may spawn-flip a couple times, and it ends like 190-200. So much fun."
This is also a problem in search and destroy. Example: defenders in crash get in that 3 story building much faster than the attackers therefor can have the building almost impossible to get into without getting 725�ed
You could stun them from the garden behind the pharmacy. Easy way to stop them and let ur team mate throw some nades
"I agree with you wholeheartedly sir, for the first few months that mw came out before they dropped obsidian I was riotshield stun and throwing knife guy. And then to mix it up I went smoke and proximity mine usually. 
But whenever I was playing with my mates(I know all 6 teammates personally and we�d always play and hang out) working towards Damascus we just usually fucked about but still capped, it wasn�t till we had tied score or a small lead where we all said �game on� and switched to hyper aggressive tactics to capture certain sides or points. 

All I�m gonna say is on Piccadilly you hold c and b but do NOT venture too close to A or spawns flip. Guaranteed win every time"
"Even in Hardpoint, the first hold can really make or break the game depending on where you spawn. 

I�m usually the OBJ guy and I bolt to the next point with 10-20 seconds left on the current point just to gain spawn superiority on that side but sometimes the game says nope."
Yeah getting spawns on your side is important af. Suldal Harbour is a big one. You NEED to flip spawns so you've got point 2 as soon as possible. Attacking point 2 is hard af due to the long open area
"Can you explain what you mean by strong and weak side of the maps?

Edit: appreciate the replies! Thanks guys!"
"Many maps have a �side� (A or C) that has a noticeable advantage over the other spawn, which leads to that strong side winning much more often. Like, per another comment on this thread, the strong side of Rammaza is the C flag. Meaning the team that spawns on the C side is going to have an advantage when it comes to capturing and holding B. It�s why you�ll hear people freaking out and telling their teammates not to push too far onto the other team�s side; you may switch spawns and get the �weaker� side. 

Personal example: I�d guess that my team wins 80% of Cheshire Park Dom matches if we start on the A side."
"For most maps, either A or C will be the 'strong' side of the map, as in, the one you'd prefer to have be your home/spawn point. Like u/ermor666 said, C on Ramaza is the better one to get. If you start at A, cool, go get yourself some B and then go back-cap C and leave it as is. You should be able to control the map so you don't allow the other team to get C back so you're forcing them to spawn near A for the rest of the map"
"If you can spawn A side on a Dom match on Crash, you're going to win, super easily.  
  
That back alley from C spawn down to A spawn is easy to make into a choke point if you're quick enough when you spawn at A.  
  
While C is incredibly hard to get into and cap, if your team gets enough killstreaks, you can trap the opposing team in C spawn easily with a VTOL or Chopper Gunner."
People who don't get these basic points are the same people who complain about being one-shotted by a 725 from 2 metres away in a very confined building. It's all about situational awareness.
"Fairly new to the game, This is my first time playing a game in the franchise, my first FPS, have less than 2000 games played. Anyone care to share which is the strong sides on the maps not mentioned yet?"
"Arklov - minor A advantage as its quicker to B, and easier to defend A and B simulatniously. 

Azhir - minor A advantage as it's easier and safer to get back to B when defending B, kinda toss up though. 

Euphrates - minor A advantage just because it's easier to get out of spawn if you're being trapped. C is easier to get trapped on. 

Granza - A side is very strong. You you simultaneously defend A and B, as well as spawns are very close to B. C spawns are horrible and you have no way to defend B from C. 

Gun runner - easier to attack B from A, but it's easier to get spawn trapped on A. Kinda toss up.

Hackney - A side strong, quicker to B, and C side is much easier to spawn trap. 

Piccadilly - C side very strong. Quick to B off spawn as well as very safe with lots of routes and cover. A side is a slaughterhouse and insanely easy to get trapped on by a semi competent team. 

Ramaza - C side strong, very quick to B, and A is easier to get trapped on. Both sides are good at defending B once you have it though, C a little more though. 

Shoothouse - C side very strong. I never cap A, straight to C. C controls office and junkyard, so easy to trap A.

Petrograd - C side slight advantage, quick to B and defends B pretty easily.

Crash - A side strong, quick to B, you can hold back alley, as well as burger joint, without over extending. Really easy to trap C.

Shipment - I like C, but it really doesnt matter. 

Vacant - C side very strong. Quick to B, protected from killstreaks, and really easy to defend B. A sucks pretty bad.

Atlas - no huge adavantage either way, I prefer A as you can defend B a bit easier. 

Khandor - A has a slight advantage due to spawns, but you can get trapped on either A or C.

Rust - A side is strong because is stupid easy to trap them on C when you have A/B

Aniyha - no real advantage either way, personal preference really.

Hardhat - A has a minor advantage because it's easier to defend B, but this ones pretty balanced.

Hovec - A side very strong. C side has you fighting uphill the whole game. The only befit of C is its quick to B but not worth it.

Backlot - No major advantage either way, I like C though because holding Taxi gets you alot of kills when they come from A.

Cheshire - No major advantage, but I like C just so your teammates dont camp the 2nd floor marked building.

Scrapyard - one of the few maps you can win by holding A and C and letting enemies hold B. No real advantage to A or C though.  

Petrov - Its a cluster fuck of a map, but personal preference is A. 

Suldal - A side strong side. You can defend B easily from A, and it's very quick to B compared to C. Back spawns at C feel like Granza, so far from B. 

Broadcast - C side very strong. Protected from kill streaks, and you're quick to B. It's also stupid easy to trap people on A. 

Tank factory - C side has a minor advantage, I think you spawn a hair closer, and it's easier to control the rooftops."
"If you choose to go for gold, platinum, or even Damascus this will be a helpful link https://damascus.now.sh
It also helps to track the reticle challenges."
I've just accepted the fact that only 5% of the playerbase actually knows how to play DOM. You have successfully vented for me.
"Yup, I�m a HC Dom player and I literally get into fights with my own team 9/10 because they�re dipshits camping at the back of the shit side of the map whilst I�m the only dumbass on B, my KD is 1.9 but boy do I struggle to keep it there, I�m a slower long range kinda player myself but you can�t just completely ignore B and the overall map flow, it�s super important. My personal two hatreds are Harbour and Backlot, you just can�t win on the wrong side"
"I said fuck my k/d I always grind for the W. I'm only a 1.10kd, but a 3.05wl. I'll go 10-50 defending B as long as I get the win lol."
As fun as shoothouse is it's absurd how one sided they made it.
"I would also like to point out that sprinting A to C, does not make you an objective player. You're doing less good for your team than the guy mounted on spawn. You need 2 points and you need to hold both. Holding 3 points is simply impossible."
And when you have total map control there is always that one idiot capturing C and fucking up spawns and shit.
Broadcast is the fucking worst. The team on C has a fucking staircase right to B and then tons of walls once they get there. While A has to try and climb up to the second floor while the other team sits there and slaughters them
Finally someone said it! I play mostly Capture the Flag and the strong side/weak side is so prevalent in that game mode. Also there are way too many players who don't play the objective and just go for kills. Its so annoying
"I was just thinking this for the 10,000 time today. 
Game has been out for almost a year and a half, yet people don't understand that C FLAG ON RAMAZA IS THE STRONG POINT. 

Also, shame on the devs for obviously not play testing the maps and fixing the spawn flips."
"And before anyone starts arguing, ""im trying to go for Dmascus/optics challenges,"" I got Damascus by Season 4, 100% optic reticle unlocked by S5, and obsidian on all launchers, half the smgs, and working through ARs rn all while maintaining a 1.9 W/L, consistent placement in top 3 leaderboard no matter the game mode, and used the Shoothouse wall for probably less than 5% of all of it."
Have the same feeling only with SnD tho.
"Nothing worse than losing a game that you had a good lead in because some dumbass wants to triple cap. Cap 2 and sit back and defend. Let the enemy come to you, what else are they going to do?"
Most of the understanding of the strong/weak side went away when they started switching sides when the first team hit 100 score because it wasn�t necessary
"Simply answer. It's CoD, people just want to shoot."
"I agree, especially about the part where you throw your KD through the window when you're the only one trying to get the upper hand while other players just camp around the map.

But it's call of duty. It's full of casuals. They don't care about wins, they want to kill. And in general structure of Domination is way better for that than classic TDM where enemy can be anywhere. Here you do have a frontline and a ""base"" of sorts and you can put yourself in a position where most likely no one will sneak up behind you, and you can more or less determine where enemy will come from, while in TDM after a minute they can literally respawn behind you, if your team moves too far from you.

But yeah, basic strategy of doing everything you can to control AB or BC and only then protecting them by camping (with one ninja wild card guy trying to backdoor the enemy and capture last flag) is a way to go in my book."
"Thinking you were talking about Ground War confused me quite a bit. Objective games are to take a simple majority and sit on it, that�s the strategy. If you don�t have the majority you can throw a Hail Mary to the other side of the map, but it�s just more of a decoy at that point...you need the center at all costs."
The amount of people who dont learn spawns and think you�re hacking because you know where there at when all it took was a uav is also mind boggling
Never try to triple cap in DOM
"Dude, they dont even understand the importance of having 2 flags more time than the enemy in order to win...hell! they don't even undertand the tactical importance of having B time to time :("
"Disagree on Vacant. It's very easy to trap C side, their only exists are the one doorway and the hazmat area."
If you are playing pubs and complaining about this that�s what�s truly mind boggling
">""Available to non-members and on other formats no earlier than November 1, 2021.""

So yeah.  This doesn't mean the Combat Packs will be made available by X date, but it clearly suggests that the Combat Packs will be be made available to all PS4, Xbox, and PC users at some point in time.  Or else they would not even address the availability of the content for non-members and those on other platforms."
"Those are the Cold War ones. The MW ones from last year should've been available to us already, but alas, more lies from activi$ion :,("
Imagine unironically being unable to kill lying on the floor shield user and then proceed to complain about it.
"Lmao people rage so hard at riot shielders but you have 3 easy ways to stop that . Thermites , semtex, and crossbow explosive tips. For every strong thing in this game , there�s a weakness"
Don't forget explosive rounds and c4 and claymores and mines and the good ole jump shot.
What bug? I'm guessing it's the match starting before a team is ready and they forfeit the first round bug?
The bug where the leader gets randomly booted from the lobby so you have to re-form the group.
Yeah that has happened since the start of the game
And yet.... still not fixed. It's ridiculous
"First off get a good build for the crossbow. Sleight of Hand perk is a must due to the slow reload time. Stick to maps that are small to medium. When trying for a long shot, always aim high as the bolt drops quite a lot over distance."
"2.2k crossbow kills and 5.7k throwing knife kills.

Listen to me very carefully.

After you read this comment, your grind will be made easier. Do not expect anyone to help you here, except yourself and your ability to learn the intricacies of a beautiful weapon, for a skilled crossbow user is very deadly.

For bolt velocity, use 28 strand cable, tac laser, ADS Speed stock, FTAC speed grip and sleight of hand. You can experiment with different attachments for so many of them affect the way the weapon handles and it�s just nice how you can make so many cool combinations, but still kill people if you�re a good shot. For example, I love running the 16 strand cable even though it decreases the velocity just because the blue wire looks sexy with a golden bow.

And you can be a good shot, you have the potential.

The one big hump with this gun is getting used to the arrow velocity. This ain�t no gun. It�s a weapon used to hunt werewolves. This leads to the player getting frustrated and turned off by the gun. However, you need to understand that this gun requires good anticipation of the enemy movement. So if you use throwing knives, learning this gun...or bow is much easier.

After tonight, do not call the crossbow trash again. Once you get good with it, you�ll be having so much fun being able to confidently slap it on in public matches and fuck shit up haha. You can be that if you change your perspective of this gun being trash. It�s very good, fun, spices the game up by bringing a new challenge, and I just haven�t been able to put it down since I got it gold, now I�m going for obsidian.

So go on OP, get out and get that gold. I know you can do it.

Oh one last thing, sensitivity. You may wanna decrease it to increase your tracking, but you may have to find your sweet spot. Personally, I play on 17h/13v sensitivity with a controller dead zone of .4 because I love doing dirty flicks on people haha.

I would totally play with you but I have work in 5 hours, but we can play after I�m off if you�re down.

Edit: Try not to use sights on this gun. IMO the extra free attachment slot goes a long way in making good setups."
This is good advice to follow as it�s a great weapon in the right hands and the responses are always good for a laugh.
Forge Tac Speedtrak - Stock / G.I. Mini Reflex - Sight \[optional\] / XRK Thunder 200lb - Arms / FTAC Speed Grip - Underbarrel / Sleight of Hand - Perk. Enjoy.
If you hate the crossbow so much why get it on gold?
"Yo gotta be one with the crossbow, trust. It may take some time but once it happens you�ll fly through the challenges."

Hey Thanks for all the awards guys! After posting this I realize I should've posted to Coldwar or Warzone as Adler isn't actually in MW... My mistake!
Are you questioning his authority?

This is warzone. Not everything that isn�t good or goes bad is Cold War.
"You know that console aim assist doesn't completely auto-aim and compensate for recoil, right?"
"I haven't had a console since PS3 so that's why the operative phrase was ""may not"" because I couldn't be entirely sure."
Aim assist has nothing to do with recoil and recoil control is 100x easier on PC.
"How you gonna say that when your sens changes with slowdown, of course it affects recoil since the amount of force or stick travel's gonna be different."
nobody's gonna use that when the ads penalty is so high and a spr's just going to dome you before you can ads.  I think pc mouse players really need to learn from controller players in terms of using iron sights and getting used to visual shake and recoil.
The update is on Thursday not tomorrow
Seconded. I was required to play several games of 2v2 Gunfight for a SMG mission challenge last week and the experience was less than pleasant but 2v2 in Face Off is all I've been playing since they added it. Even got Shipment once :D
Fuck yes please for the love of God
"it�s not connected to cold war whatsoever outside of warzone so i wouldn�t expect any other cod�s to be any different. I would recommend buying this game over cold war for multiplayer, however i wouldn�t say cross game integration to be a factor whatsoever"
"I doubt it. The only link that MW has to CW is warzone through a shared battlepass. A battlepass thats only for CW and Warzone i might add. They never linked the old COD games so I doubt they will now. Once CW's dev cycle is over around October or November, I doubt MW will even share the battlepass anymore. Assuming that they want to link the next game to warzone which they no doubt will. But its hard to say. I cant imagine the pain of linking 3 games to the same pass and cross progression, which is why I have my doubts."
'I hurt myself today'
'To see if I still feel'
I didn�t even know they could explode
"As a mainly hardcore player, I've probably been killed more times by random objects exploding than by melee weapons. For real, shit's explode all the time."
"I depend on those canisters and extinguishers exploding.  Always get someone in Gun Runner coming through the door by the B node, usually more than 1"
So many times I've died in Search as the last man alive due to those godamn things because of a previous gunfight near them.
"Vacant is the worst, there's one outside the b door near bathroom, one in the back of  A plant near the wall."
"Dude fr. This shit is so annoying. There�s so much in this game that punishes you for making the good play, and rewards the other for making a shitty one."
More often I find myself dying to some kind of explosive even when I have flak jacket because of the extra damage from these little environmental explosives. The worst ones are those fucking generators

Well. Clearly this isn�t up to code. We�ll have a guy out on Thursday to replace it with one that�s up to date. Sorry for the inconvenience.
The extinguisher becomes the extinguished? Idk I�m high.
I've done exactly this with more random acetylene tanks  than i can count.
What maps have acetylene tanks? Really curious. Haven't seen many maps with hazards and also how on earth can you tell those tanks are full of acetylene?
Just when you've thought you seen it all....
Lol die from that but get hit markers shooting somebody in the face
hit markers from headshots is what keeps me playing on only hardcore modes. I'd play realism if it wasn't dead
I won a gunfight tournament on Rust because of a stray bullet hitting an extinguisher
Not as bad as killing yourself with your own trophy system after an enemy one blows it up when you set it down...

"Context: He runs into bathroom once I call it in. He has a UAV so he�s trying to find my body by the time I comeback. I bait him by flying the cruise out of the map area, he feels safe to run from bathroom to warehouse but I flip it around and hit him."

"if only we can do this with a mouse, but for some reason the movement speed of the cruise missile is twice as slow with a mouse"
It took mw two and a half months to resolve a 30min double xp token issue where I had to send multiple photos of proof of purchase. All that time for them to send me a working code. I really wish a gaming news outlet would cover the large number of stolen accounts and lack of recourses Activision is putting into supporting players effected by these types of attacks.
Did you have 2fa
"Apparently not, but theres a post out there with people that had the same problem but activision got them their account back"
I had a similar issue just yesterday. Booted out of a gunfight tournament game at 5-5 because my account had been unlinked. Hoping they get back to me within 10 days or I�m uninstalling.
":\ that sucks im sorry to hear. As far as games go this is one of my fears, all in all MW is one of my favorite multiplayer games of all time, & hearing ppl get perma banned or stuff like this when they havent cheated or anything is spooky."
"I have way too many hours played on this game lol, but im not even banned, i still see my account in my regiment but there is no way to access it"
It took my friend almost 6 months to get his account back. It just depends on how fast they are willing to get to your problem. I dont know what influences their speed if anything. But you already did your part by putting in the ticket. Now just cross your fingers.
They need to disable account unlinking. Asap.
Do have a YouTube?
yes look up raidonpc
"The main focus for most of MW�s lifecycle was Warzone. Activision cared more for that game because it made them a ludicrous amount of money. Much more than MW did. For much of that time Infinity Ward was split between Warzone and MW so they never gave the multiplayer the facts that many feel it deserved (myself included). However, now Raven has taken over Warzone, which means that Treyarch can spend almost all of their time focused on CW and Zombies. It sucks, but it�s business. The next MW will be much more focused and build on everything that was great about MW 2019"
"I may be the minority here but I really hope they keep tactical sprint, doors and mounting. I really think they are/were great additions to the series. As more of a fan of the older cods I picked up advanced warfare when it launched and it completely turned me off of the series and I hated the way it was heading and hadn't played a cod since then until mw2019. Hands down my favorite cod to date. Then they shit on everything that they worked towards with cold war. It is infuriating"
"I agree that it reinvigorated the CoD franchise.

I had given up on CoD for quite a few years before it came out because the games were so lame. 

It�s the first CoD since 4 that I actually consider a great game."
I glitch like that all the time it's a pain. On the bright side watching the kill cam of you doing circles is always funny to watch.
This happens to me when I play cold war

I had something similar going on for like a day or 2 but its been fine since then

I stopped playing it�s fucking balls rn
"PS4 Pro, i'm not lagging but stuttering. this doesn't help but yeah just to let you know that this shit happens on console too"
You don't say
Bruh am having hella connection problem sometimes I get Booted from playing.
Hi
Happened to me as soon as they took the tournament away. That shit was so easy to win btw because people kept lagging out. The victory was basically handed to me. They need to just stick these tournaments in rotation for the people who missed the cool shit due to disconnecting.
On pc and I have pretty bad lag tbh- brand new pc too with a 3070 and 3700x
"I run the same setup. I cap the fps to 144 and it was smooth before the Thursday update. It's laggy at 144fps, lol. I was actually streaming my 29 streak and the stream froze up while the super lag started"
Don't know if it's My PS4 pro or the servers. Super laggy. Can't play SnD.
"Tbh, it's not as bad rn.... Still acts up, but not too bad rn, compared to ladt weekend"
Magpul RVG
Can confirm. Still have the coyote tan colored one that used to be on my M4A1. I think it is also featured on the MP7 & a couple others in game.
Thanks.
Yeah I just did them all on domination on shipment
"Look for open maps and play games like domination.  The flags outside allow for attacker and defender kills and if nothing else, you can melee and it still counts.

Don�t wait for shoot the ship as there�s no telling when it�ll come back and there are other ways available to finish the grind.

Edit: headquarters is another option and you can even do capture the flag."
"Maps like grazna raid and arklov peak have a hardpoint in the middle of an open field which makes it easy, I got a quad feed once!"
"If you do HC, melee one shots, and that�s what I used.

If you do domination, sneak up into their spawn, step on point for 1 second, then when they run in to clear the point, hit them on the head."

"That�s not an optimization problem, that�s a rig problem lol. Something in your pc is faulty. Probably the 3080, I read a lot of them were defective. 

I have a 1080Ti and I run the game on max with none of those issues, sitting comfortably over 140 FPS."
"I meant to say maybe the game is not optimized for the newer cards at the moment, or the other way around. Every time a new generation comes out we have to rely on CPU/GPU driver updates. Worse yet, it ONLY happens with Modern Warfare and rarely with Cold War, and all my other games run great, even Cyberpunk 2077, never had a crash with it, which makes me think maybe Blizzzard needs to roll out a patch fix?"

"Objective kill campers are convinced their eenyweenytinywilly will grow for every .01 KD they gain in stats. So that�s why. The jokes on them tho, they�re hopeless in WZ or tournament anyway."
"I think the worst ones are when you see your teammate camping, in front of the objective you�re trying to get and they let you get killed first before they kill the opponent. Like seriously?! If you�re going to camp, fine; but at least  cover my back!"
"This is why I start blocking their view when they�re pulling that toxic behavior.  I usually run my riot shield and if you�re camping you better cover my six, if not, I�m blocking you so you have to make a move toward the objective (sometimes I�ll pop smoke too).  That�s not often but every now and then it�s necessary."
"This, so much this!"
"Because their kill whores and just sit back and pick off easy kills . I've always found that playing the objective actually helps with kills anyway , and way more fun ."
It also depends on the map as a lot of people are grinding camos or specific challenges. On StS for example you don't want people playing the OBJ because it makes the game end quicker which reduces your time to get the challenges you need.
"Was not aware of this, thanks!"
bc cod players care about different things.  they're not all working towards the same goal.  and sbmm and team balancing makes playing the obj useless at times.
"I guess I just assumed every player to filter the game modes they want to play, but it seems people just play whatever and pretend its team deathmatch."
"I mostly play domination and one thing people forget is that defends are more important than captures. I'm not promoting camping with this but I see people running around capping flags all the time but fail to hold them or they go capping all the flags and flip the spawns etc.

That won't win the game, capturing AND holding the flags does."
"Yeh that I understand. I understand the scoreboard doesn't directly reflect how well you've done overall. When we do team practice in customs, I sometimes have no points but definitely did stuff. But in general I feel like 90% of the players don't really do anything besides running and gunning"
"I play a lot of domination as well and I feel like holding/camping b is the only one that really matters. With spawn flips, holding a and c don�t really matter as much"
Way more kills why play a game of tdm where the game ends at 75 even if you got a whole third of your teams kills that�s 25 kills (not enough for 2 obsidian counts) when you can play hardpoint and drop 2-3 times as many kills
You can drop kills and help to achieve a win instead of killing and losing on purpose?
People play obj game modes instead of TDM because they�re longer and more predictable than TDM and they don�t play obj because they don�t have to. If you are looking for a game mode where people play obj I�d recommend search and destroy or cyber attack. SND is a lot of fun and all I play now.
"Yeh I have SnD, tdm, hardpoint, dom and kill confirmed in my list, but think I'll get rid of a few :)"
Try Headquarters. In my experience most players actually try for the objective. And if they don't it's pretty easy to defend on your own sometimes.
People don�t play the OBJ because MW has killstreaks and people don�t play OBJ on CW because in order to get streaks in that game you need to go on high killstreaks multiple times... this is why scorestreaks need to return
That actually makes a lot of sense. Is there a way to queue for games without Killstreaks? A) I suck at streaks and B) I enjoy the game way more without
"Thing is, you don�t have to be on the objective to help with the objective.

I like cutting off flanks and defending the objective, but as long as one or two teammates are actually on the point, it�s not necessary to actually be on it. Killing people near it will help just as much"
"> Thing is, you don�t have to be on the objective to help with the objective.
> 
> I like cutting off flanks and defending the objective, but as long as one or two teammates are actually on the point, it�s not necessary to actually be on it. Killing people near it will help just as much

In theory yes, but that's not what these people are doing. They literally have 00:00 on hardpoint, are not on top of kills either and are not defending the hardpoint in any logical spot or whatsoever. 

Last week I had a Kill confirmed match where out of 50 kills they had only confirmed 2. That is not even trying to win the game."
"This is exactly why I don't enjoy many if these game modes, plus I mainly go for kills, so I play tdm most of the time anyway"
"I ONLY play CTF, and im a try hard... lol"
I miss hardcore HQ on shipment :'(
"I like to play Kill Confirmed when i need to do some stuff for example getting camos, weapon XP or doing daily missions cuz game takes longer than TDM when you dont do objective and that means you can get more stuff done in single match."
"For hardpoint you really only need 1 person in the obj.  More people doesn't mean more points.  Its actually smart to have just one person in the box and have the rest of team outside of the box defending lanes.  If the whole team was in the box a simple explosive lethal or launcher round can take out the entire defending team and leaving it open to the offensive team to capture the box.    


Agree with your point about kill confirm, i see so many people just run past dog tags but sometimes it can be a disadvantage to get the tags because the enemy can easily camp those tags."
You should probably go outside and socialise if you�re worried so much about how people play a game that is 18 months old.
"Domination and Hardpoint, but it�s certain that shipment will return soon"
Hard point is easy to get a lot of kills in
Domination is pretty good imo I'm average and get 25+ kills pretty regularly.
"The playlist changes every Thursday. I would play tdm, domination, or faceoff"
I like to play Kill Comfirmed. Its like TDM but its longer when you dont do objective. Only kill people and dont pick up tags. Sometimes i get games that end on time limit cuz nobody is playing objective and just kill eachother.
I'm liking the current Face Off mode. It's 2v2 but the maps are small. It's not as good as Livestock 4v4 but it's not bad.
Ground war. Plenty of ppl to kill
Thinking of getting it too. Anybody know the total size on Xbox
Either ground war or plunder
10v10 moshpit last longer so you can rack up more kills than in tdm.
"I should have used a different wording - I am looking for a mode with the highest kills/time ratio, as the Grau challenge is to get 5 kills with an AR in one minute 25 times. I guess Domination and Hardpoint modes have that."
yeah I fell you Im waiting for the leatherface bindle for a while but good news actually apear to me in the just for you category like 3 weeks ago

I did it in hardcore hq

Nah you definitely hit him m8

This is how I�m playing right now after my two month break lmao I�m losing it
Somehow that bad with damascus
"bro I have no idea what happened, my mouse was just not going where I wanted it to"
Yes I'm always this bad https://youtu.be/uUaKeOP8E88
"Sometimes mine is worse.

I have missed 7 shots with a SPR on a still target a few feet away. I still have no clue how that happened to this day, and how they didn�t see me."
I couldn't see with the zoom
"I did that to help see lol, especially the slo mo bit at the end?"
Looks like you need to turn down you sensitivity by half.
"This is honestly just a one off, usually I'm hitting them no problem just found it funny dunno what happened there"

"We gotta wait for drop zone and shipment 24/7. Domination, hardpoint, ffa is all we have"
"Hard point and headquarters are good for joker kills where e eryone groups up for the objectives, to get vehicles I just ran around in warzone and shot all the vehicles that had no one in them. Personal radars in HC are easy money too."
Free for all
Headquarters has lots of radars and UAVs.
Honestly for the attacker/defender kills I would play HC Dom and camp a flag( usually b) and when the other team would go to recapture it I�d just throw a flash and melee them cuz that JOKR is fucking brutal.
Does the melee one shot in HC?
"Funny enough the joker is really good on shipment if you just spam fire the opposite side of the map, you�re bound to hit someone"
Damn I feel bad for the one guy <0.5.
That was me the first three months lol
1.45 currently I remember when it was 0.97 and I was trying to get it to 1.00 lmao.
Haha yes I was at that point a few weeks ago too. Such a relief when it finally hit 1.00 xD
I was at 2 then I decided to grind platinum on snipers marksman and smgs so that took its toll
"I am average.

&#x200B;

It' makes me both sad and happy."
I feel exactly the same
 A bit over 1 but i did damascus and the shield tanked it harddd so it took a while to recover.
Started at like under 1 when the game first came out and slowly but surely brought it back up to 1.8
Started ~1.4 then grinded damascus and reticles. Dropped to 0.99. Grinding Grandmaster and down to .95.
"1.0, fuck this game. 
Every other cod I can do pretty well in. Idk if its infinite wards matchmaking or netcode or what, but mw and iw are incredibly difficult for me."
"Overall K/D is a pointless stat. You could be someone that only plays heavily objective oriented modes like Domination, Hardpoint, Headquarters etc and have a negative K/D but be the best team player capping flags, defending and winning games. On the flip side you could be getting shit loads of kills, have a 2+ K/D and be the shittiest team player avoiding capping flags, defending etc.

Context matters.

My overall K/D is 1.32
Domination K/D is 1.25
S&D K/D is 1.5
This is with having done Damascus too"
2.14
Wow you�re so cool
"Damn, wish it was a bit less discrete. I have a 1.05 and feel like a 1.49 is just so wildly different than me in skill level. Not a knock on you OP, I know Reddit limits the number of options you can make."
Haha yes it is my first poll I've done on reddit. Wanted to put .25 steps but I couldn't add more options. But I feel like a 1.05 player can still somewhat compete with a 1.49 player.
kd is kinda pointless when there are campers and killstreak spammers
"From a 1.07 to 0.98 after Damascus. For the life of me I can't get the hang of consistently quick-scoping so snipers and marksmans were the death knell on the KD, nevermind the riot shield. Ooof."
Exactly one but I bought the game to do Damascus after playing Warzone for awhile.
"My K/D before going for Damascus was probably around .4. I wasn�t the best because this is my first FPS game, so I cornercapmed with a 725 and had like 2 seconds before I would react to someone. 

I regret playing like that, but it helped me learn some of the controls.

As I went for Damascus, I got better, so my K/D is now around 1.01-1.02.

Couldn�t care less though. I like to run meme classes, because they�re fun, not because they help my K/D."
I�m 1.76 but haven�t played in a bit
1.4
I think 0.8 something?
[1.07](https://i.imgur.com/I2Uvpli.jpg)
2.3 in MW. It was 2.21 before most people moved to the new game
"I only count my KD for SnD HC, rest of the modes are for grinding w/o emotions :-)"
Lol if I�m only counting my SND k/d it would be a 2
4 kd i just play Ground War can't imagine this game without it. All the other modes feels so slow
While playing Ground War my kd usually drops. That game mode feels to me like: spawn - run 2 seconds - get sniped from across the map xD
laughs in 5.17
.97
2.17
1.49 now was at .87 in November
5.17
Prove or it didn't happen xD
1.33 for multiplayer
"2.3, mostly play TDM"
"Headquarters 1.25, regular domination 1.08, and Groundwar I sit at 4.04, overall kd is 2.58. The difference between SBMM and no SBMM is crazy."
"0,99 to 1 while grinding damascus, so when tryharding it would become better but not too much"
Currently 3:50 in mw. Black ops cw kd went to shit tonight.
"Friendly reminder- with SBMM manipulating matchmaking by constantly trying to bring you to a 1.0- K/D is no longer a good indicator of skill for COD.

So don't define yourself by your K/D- because SBMM is doctoring the number."
Dont know dont care
Sbmm my boii
"The problem is that Modern Warfare was so different from everything else, such a leap forward. Cold war is by no means bad, but is closer to previous games such black ops and WW2 in terms of arcadiness, and the shock of going back is why people have problems with CW"
"cold war is actually worse than previous CoDs. the netcode is worse than bo1 goddamnit, i have no clue how they even did that"
"Uh.. what exactly are you tryin to accomplish with this post?

People bitching about people bitching is still the same thing, people bitching"
"Modern Warfare has better animations, sound effects, graphics and all around gun feel. It's got better maps and feels significantly better to play than Cold War. 

All CoD games offer similar experiences, but Modern Warfare was the most different CoD game in years. Infinity Ward did a great job upgrading the engine to feel more modern and realistic, Cold War threw that progress away and went back to using the old Black Ops engine. Cold Wars feels more dated by comparison."
"I would agree most CODs are similar, but IMO Cold War sucks and MW is superior to any COD in recent years. But that�s just like...my opinion, man."
My problem is that a lot of the opinions are just unfounded. I don't really see many legitimate reasons why people dislike the game other than nitpicks.
"I mean at the broadest level, they are the same, but there�s many things different about them once specify a little more. The engines they run on themselves make the game move and shoot different. Also, the difference between the aesthetic choices of IW and Treyarch are always different. IW tries to make realistic games while blending in arcade elements that make the game fun. Treyarch leans more on the arcadey side with less realistic, but more fun and colorful aesthetics. There�s more to go on about, but saying the games are basically the same is wrong.

I also tend to disagree with a lot of the people here saying �cW bAd� because I love both games to death, but they are in no way the same game"

Like that one marine in MW2 who did an ok job as a footsoldier somehow impresses General Shepherd (who is inexplicably on the front lines) enough to become a CIA spook and instantly infiltrate Makarov's inner circle. The logistics of what's going on are basically never considered in these games, and yes it bugs the shit out of me too."

"The guy in MW2 was a soldier not a marine, gen shep is army as well & as strange as it sounds that is how reassignment works sometimes. If memory serves, he was already a Ranger & they were looking to recruit someone. You wouldnt just run the pit & say ""im in"" theyd look at other quals & APFT scores & what not but yeah. Youre right about one thing theres no way he would be in that combat zone (its not a front line, there are no front lines these days much, not since the Korean war)"

"1-A: Cos he's Captain John Fucking Price.  
1-B: It's not totally unheard of for groups like UKSF and the CIA to work together. They're part of NATO, and since we later find out Price has specific experience and knowledge of the stolen gas, Laswell reached out to him for his capability and expertise. He probably would still have to clear going after all that with his superiors, but after the Picadilly attacks and the links between the gas and Al-Qatala and the attacks proper, the SAS probably has a vested interest in finding the bastards, so Price and Gaz join up with the CIA as part of a joint-op.  


2: Not impossible, TBH. Gaz is also SAS, but is attached to the Met as a counterterrorism operator. The SAS isn't that big as well, likely what happened was Price asked his superior to fold Gaz back in with his own unit, since Gaz states he's had intel on the AQ cell that blows up Picadilly Circus ""for weeks"".  


3. If the NATO strike team was doing a false flag (like we're led to believe they did), it would likely be an APC with no identifying marks that's used by many other countries or can otherwise be easily obtained. Worst case, cleanup crews are sent in afterwards to get rid of any non-Urzikstani bodies and materiel. In fact, nearly every piece of equipment would either have to have been scrubbed for possible origin tracing or not used things that can be pointed right to the US (a mere C-130 isn't exclusively a US plane, after all, etc.). More than likely the op would have required the OKs from the head of every unit involved in the op, and given the SAS's shadowy ops record, it should be no shock they'd back something like this if it involved destroying a rogue Russian general's chemweapon (they've literally invaded PRISONS for less)."
">1-A: Cos he's Captain John Fucking Price.

Understandable, have a good day

>1-B: It's not totally unheard of for groups like UKSF and the CIA to work together.

Yeah but I imagine a booty call is not enough to recruit somebody

>Picadilly attacks

Completely fucking didn't connect the dots between the attack and the CIA. Like duh SAS would cooperate. Now it's weird they only sent Price and Gaz but sure, I can see why they would cooperate now.

>""for weeks"". 

Oh yeah, that's a good point

>APC with no identifying marks that's used by many other countries or can otherwise be easily obtained.

Hm, sure, that could somehow somewhat work, why not. It's plausible at least.

>Worst case, cleanup crews are sent in afterwards to get rid of any non-Urzikstani bodies and materiel.

Imagine looking through all the shrubbery to find that one 5.56 American made shell.

>scrubbed for possible origin

True, plausible.

>they've literally invaded PRISONS for less

I should stop thinking ""why would special intelligence agencies invade countries"" and start thinking ""well, why wouldn't special intelligence agencies invade countries?"""
"CoD campaigns are just playable action movies, you�re overthinking it."
"Sure but I would like to be somewhat """"""immersed"""""" without being pulled out by ""hm, wait, how, how does it work, why?"""
"I hope this doesn't sound like I am giving you a condescending dismissal, but as others have pointed out, but as far as the APC goes, any sense of logical logistics in the Call of Duty franchise has been deliberately ignored since MiGs flew over the I-95. I noticed it too, trust me.

That being said, if you want a shaky attempt at an explanation, it'd be that Georgia is a NATO member, and rising tensions are mentioned in passing between the US and Russia, so it's certainly possible that the Bradley could be part of a US task force akin to the one in Poland IRL. It'd be really weird to use one to support a special operations mission against an entrenched modern military force, but there's an explanation at least.

If anything, a bigger question gets raised here: How was Barkhov able to set up a whole-ass chemical weapons facility in the middle of Borjomi, which is effectively the Georgian equivalent of Aspen, Colorado and situated less than 200km from the friggin' capital, Tiblisi, without anyone catching wind of it?"
">condescending dismissal

Funny thing is that this doesn't sound condescending at all, this is a proper answer.

As opposed to many other condescending answers in this thread..."
Well maybe they were working together to find and kill all the responsables for the picadilly incident and Price and Garrick (im not calling him Gaz) were send as sort of representation of the SAS/UK
It's a call of duty. What ur doing is paramount to complaining about the lack of realism in the recent fast and furious movies. Like no duh.

"Well, why not add the ability to filter for games instead of playlists?
Just like in so many other games? I recently opened BF1 after 2 years of absence and it still has a lot of acive players, the ability to filter out maps you don''t like and so on..."
"Yeah, I like BF1's system, it does, however, make it more difficult to find servers running certain maps, so there's little map variety anymore, especially with the DLCs like turning tides and whatnot. And certain modes, like Frontlines, are all but dead due to this system. Though, if I had to choose, I'd take BF1's server browser system over MW's matchmaking system any day."
I think they know if we had 24/7 Shipment there would be less people on CW & Warzone because a decent portion of us would go grind out more camos for damascus.
"It wouldn't be so bad if the map rotation for the core playlists wasn't blatantly weighted towards the snoozefest maps. In an evening's playtime I'll get 1 match of either shoothouse, shipment or rust, just 1. Meanwhile maps like grazna raid or arklov peak seem to appear 3 or 4 times each."
"they want people to stop playing modern warfare and buy cold war, because they only care about money. so they are desperately doing everything possibe to reduce the playerbase for mw. they take away fan-favourite playlists and give us crappy ones so we dont play. they are not releasing the new maps or new guns or any new content whatsoever because they are afraid that mw will get attention again."
"Lol no it's not. It's been like this since the start of MW where they change playlists.

Also if they wanted to stop people from playing MW, why was cross level progression added to MW and you can level up the battle pass?"
Because that would be smart. Duh.
"Shoot the ship is the same as the Strikezone 24/7 playlist in Ghosts,nobody gives a shit about the other maps and modes,just play that map for everything that you need(camos,new attachments or just 4fun) because almost all the maps are extremely bad or mediocre because of camping,they tried to make it like a cqb battlefield in the map design but ultimately failed."
"I don't understand dropping Ground War so often (or rotating out it's alternate modes since most of them aren't too great) since it was a huge selling point leading up to launch.  As for removing playlists of smaller maps I'd imagine they don't want people playing the game just to grind camos and get stoned.  There probably is something in there about the ecosystem of unlocking attachments ""too fast"" but if every other playlist gets rotated out the same as StS then I don't get why it's such a big deal."
"I dunno why they should care. If all you want to do is grind camos, whatever, that's your prerogative. Grinding camos isn't like camping, it doesn't ruin the fun for everyone else (it only ruins the fun for the people grinding the camos (because let's be honest, camo challenges in MW are hella boring)), it's just a goal. Also, unlocking attachments ""too fast"" would make sense in other games, but this game has 200,000,000+ weapons, so I don't see the problem, and again, like with the camos, just let people play the way they want to. You wanna have fun, go right ahead! You wanna grind to death and yearn with every waking moment for the sweet release of death, whatever. I don't think IW or Raven need to concern themselves with why people are playing, they just need to give the players what they ask for and leave it alone."
"I wonder at times if we overestimate how many people truly like Shoot the Ship. I like Shoothouse, but Shipment I can do without. I back out of more Shipment games than I play. I have to be in a certain mood it. I love Shipment on 2x2, that's a lot of fun. But a TDM or FFA on that map is a bit ridiculous. 

That said, IW and Activision are the only ones with the data. Only they know what's really popular and what's not. Myself personally, I love Trench, but the only time it was a feature playlist that I can recall is when it was initially introduced."
"Shipment is super fun if you kind of know the spawns and where and how people spawn. If you�re able to control the map, you can go for 80+ kills easy, which I find super fun. But there are days where you run into those fire shotgun and stun people"
Because to know what community likes you need to listen to this community. And they don�t do it
Shipment HC DOM 24/7 thx! So i can blow out my mind  :-)
Yes
The point is to make you hate the game and go to the next COD. That's why nuketown 24/7 has been in the CW playlist since it's launch.
People actually like that map? I hate CW's version of Nuketown.
"The main issue I believe is revenue for them, as we see by all the daily posts of wanting shipment, shoot house on the playlist, alot of cod mw users are so happy at playing this, they aren't gonna buy cold war, and that's another new game money lost. Im one of those users, in fact in they released a lite version of mw with just shipment and livestock I'd probably buy it. If you enjoy playing shipment, that's all that matters, that's what's a game is for at the end of the day, all these ranks and who's got the most xps and carrying over to another version is a different story if you enjoy playing shipment etc it doesn't matter in the slightest"
They probably think it will get them more money lmao
"I believe they remove the playlists and then re-add them so people will have a reason to keep coming back. It's a scummy system that only exists so that the player base spikes every two weeks. They know people will love shoot the ship if they leave it in and that it will make the players happy, but if they take it out for two weeks at a time, they know people will come back and play it as much as possible while it's in the game A lotta players over a short amount of time rather than a consistent number of players over an extended period of time. It's like the battle pass, it's only intended to keep people coming back."
well CW doesn't do that (or does less of that) and the result is it takes a lot longer to be matched into a game on less popular playlists (e.g. HC face off)
">Why not just leave all the playlists that have ever been put on the game and let people choose what they want to play? 

People who keep asking for this have no idea the consequences it has on matchmaking.

The game doesn't have an infinite amount of players to cater to. The player count is finite (albeit larger than most online games due to crossplay). But people still gravitate toward a limited number of playlists. Adding more and more just ends up bloating the game. There is a thing called ""having too many choices"". It's bad enough that people already have different Quick Play filter preferences. Adding more choices would only result in certain modes never having enough players, which would result in worse connections for low population regions, or even no games at all.

Case in point, Cold War has a fuckton of playlists right now, and it's bloated as hell. Searching for modes like Combined Arms and Fireteam can take forever, and in regions like Asia, you end up being put in a >200ms server. It also doesn't help that Fireteam is put in the bottom of the menu, so it gets even less attention."
"Yeah but wouldn�t plethora of playlists bring even more players to the game who wouldn�t play the game because they don�t have a large variety of playlists? Look at older or even recent battlefield games. Still have a ton of players. The PC COD4 which is a old ass game has a battlefield type of filtering system(it�s a plug-in ) , where you can select dozens of game modes and that game is still maxing out the 32-48 player lobbies. Now imagine if MW had the same thing as COD4, with the current players base.

In terms of CW, I think the problem is that the game is just really bad, and this is coming from someone who is usually optimistic about cod games. ( I loved Ghosts, WW2 and AW). The only thing saving it is cross platform."
"1. The engine has a limit to how many playlists there can be at once. (could be a memory limit)
2. Not everyone likes mindless game modes and it makes it much harder for smaller regions to find games in other modes.
3. Maybe you should play the other modes and get better at them rather than complaining because it hurts your ego and you can't get instant gratification.
4. Playlists are very likely automated at this point."
"1. Doubt.  Wasn�t there a huge array of playlists earlier in 2020? I remember you had shipment and shoot house split, then you had a bunch of 10v10 playlists. You had those mosh pits as well and the drop zone, all at the same time.

2. It�s not mindless, it just more fun and actually takes skill because you must attack the objectives and are actually forced to rotate. The 4v4 moshpit was crazy fast paced and objective based, not one game goes to the time limit.

3. It�s not about performance, but rather enjoyment. I play just as good and actually have higher stats on these slow hide and seek games modes, because you just die less often. The problem is that games are supposed to excite you and get you all hyped and not make you feel like you want to take a nap.

4. Probably."
How exactly is a rainbow made? How exactly does a sun set? How exactly does a posi-trap rear end on a Plymouth work? It just does.

How the hell did you not get killed hahaha
I actually think i was in huis game cause there was a guy going around with the same stuf and killed me several times
imagine not knowing tactitcal sprint
what's your activision ID (totally not asking because you're a knifer and that i'd like to play with you)
"This sub is for call of duty modern warfare 2019, not all existing MW games ;)"
What is with your brighness? brighter as sun ...
What do you mean?
Sure you can use them. Why not? I used one last weekend to level the new Fara
"That�s what I was guessing, just wanted to make sure because they seem obsessed with Cold War and I wouldn�t have been surprised if you could only use them there"
"You can use BP xp tokens on Warzone but not ordinary MP, as they practically count as Black Ops Cold War xp tokens and not Modern Warfare"
So the double weapon xp tokens wont work in Modern Warfare?
I agree with all of your points here. It sucks how little attention this mode got. It would also be great if AI got a rework.
These are all solid points that should be implemented in the game!
"I saw a guys launcher through a wall and killed him.   I'm sure similar thing has happened to me before too.   

What I don't understand is when people get snapshot, sit behind a wall, I shoot through it and hear them yell ""There's no way you knew where I was!""   

Happens constantly, as if these people don't see the orange."
I thought they didn�t refund microtransactions. How did you manage to do that?
Through the Xbox Refund system. the Stitch skin seems to be gone but the cod points are still there.
Fuckin rat
Imagine playing like that and still loosing a 1v1...
This was literally just fooling around
bite the curb
roze needs to burn
Agreed
"Servers are horrible as of late. Frame time lag is through the roof. Connection times and ping times can be less then 40, but it feels like you are lagging through walls. Never mind the bugs are crazy. Its like they have turned off half the servers and just through the game out. 

I wish you the best of luck! PC player here, on wired. Internet connection 500/500 direct Fiber. So it isn't my network connection. Full 10GB Back bone from Firewall to switch to this workstation that plays games."
"Damn, then it's not only me (the ""not loading entire squads and rounds"" on the tournament made me really question that)  


I'm on a shitty, 20mb ADSL here in Italy, but I've always played this game. It never was this sh\*tshow. I mean, of course my connection is basic and gave me problems from time to time, but nothing as crazy as these days"
It�s not your connection it�s the game servers.  I�ve had similar issues but was the one getting kicked out of tournaments due to connection problems.
"same here, I�ll be rubberbanding like crazy"
PC here. I get frequent packet loss and have had  some weird stuttering issues whenever I would engage with several enemy players
"Today went definetely better. Played really a little, something like 4 just four games of Kingslayers - one dropped mid-game, one had some problems but manageable, two standard games. Even won the last one"
Fine for me on ps5/wired
"PS4 wired here. No obvious packet loss or lag as such, but 3 matches timed out on me near  completion yesterday and that is pretty much unheard of in my experience."
"had one server completely die on me in MP, a lot of server issues in WZ however. I found the limited time modes to consistently have good servers though"
"I'm going to be honest, when I saw the Kar98 with a vlk 3.0, I was a bit worried but then I saw the HDR with it so I realised you were using a double sniper.

You're doing really well and if you keep going you'll be hitting some crazy shots. Keep up the good work!"
Thanks! What about my sniping with the Spr-208
"Level is separate from skill and reflects the amount of experience points someone earned across both games and Warzone.  You likely have encountered people who are more familiar with the maps and using meta weapons.  

I would suggest taking some time to play the co-op special ops missions to get a feel for weapons and how you want to adjust attachments as they unlock.  Additionally, I would say take some time to play private matches here and there against bots to familiarize yourself with some of the maps.  You can adjust the difficulty, but map familiarity will definitely help.

Skill based matchmaking has nothing to do with what you�re experiencing at the moment, unless you�re encountering reverse boosters, but lot of people want to place blame on that when it�s not the case."
"Level does not equal skill. Ive been destroyed by a level 1 when I'm max rank. The only thing that level means is how much they've played to get to that point. If you're getting killed easy, its not because of the high levels, its just their skill level and your bad luck. Just keep playing and you'll get better. A prime example of level not equalling skill is when you get over level 100, and if you feel you haven't improved, your level doesn't mean anything. You're still the same player you were. A number is just a number."
"Plus,the levels are integrated,and a lot of people seem to forget that

A lot of the level 200+ people you see on Warzone play MW/CW MP constantly,and they might play Warzone for a match or two"
You are playing a game filled with people who have been playing COD and FPS for over a decade (including myself)- sadly SBMM does not help at all
"I like your username. Also IDK why, whenever I play war zone I also have the issue of pairing with high levels. I don�t play WZ much but I got MW the day it came out so I assumed that was why"
"That�s just SBMM for you, it doesn�t care about your level it just means if you do good in 1 match, then you�re gonna get absolutely smashed into oblivion by try hard MLG sweaty Dorito eating little 13 years old for the next 5 or 6, until it drops you down again."
Play modern warfare remastered
"All of those, except Broadcast. I cannot put into words how much that map annoys me. It�s even one I don�t like for SnD/cyber which says a lot as most of the shit maps still work well on these modes."
It went from my least favorite to one i look forward to in s&d. Everyone plays it a bit different so it's always a surprise.
"Nice post but lol dome isn�t coming out bro neither is killhouse although I want it to it�s been in warzone map like scrapyard and broadcast so I still have hope. I would also like a small map playlist shipment, shoothouse, rust, killhouse (if it ever releases) etc"
??
What?
Guessing you never played the original modern warfare?
"that was a regular bunny hop, not even close to a bounce"
Didn�t press jump twice hence why I�m asking the question here
"Welcome welcome, the grind is real!"
Congrats! Ha ent seen too many Kilos so thats awesome!
As I got closer to finishing the grind I think I finished so many matches with 14 kills. So frustrating!
Meanwhile I�m still trying to get gold
FaZe Jev be like: just you wait!
wow take ya time ahha
w/o Shipment its a pain to claim that 15 or 10 kills more than 1 time per match.
Hacked maybe?
Hacked. Welcome to the club.
i have to do a account recovery?
"The pattern of Call of Duty games usually is 3 year development cycles + 1 year of content upon release.

You're better off waiting for MW2022"
"Development cycles, meaning like game updates and fixes, right? Or does that mean like making the game itself?"
"Well that's not true because Infinite Warfare, BO3 and WWII (to name a few) had regular updates and new content for like 2-3 years until that developers next CoD game came out."
BO4 and BOCW were 2 years apart
"Yeah, the game could have easily had a Year 2 and a Year 3 of content before a proper sequel."
"They should honestly prepare at least 6 months of post launch year content for each game to drop every other month. They need to accept that many people don�t buy every new cod.

Edit: That gives people who don�t like the new game at least new content until maybe the title after stirs their interest. Activision should care more about how many people play their games as opposed to what game they are playing. Cater to us instead of forcing a horse to water when it�s not thirsty yet."
"i mean, the question is justified because there is still non available content in the game files but do we seriously ask this question after +10 annual CODs in a row??   
release trailer in may > get people hype > show MP footage at E3 > release beta > release game > release content > oh shit may again...."
"I can so relate to the May thing. Was enjoying MW SS5 or sth and was still hyped af, then I realized it was the 5th of May and was like �ah fuck�"
I think some bundles will rotate in the store and that there will be a small update featuring Soap and the new weapons.
I want more AK bundles lol.
I hope they bring back jawbone :(
"You�d think with how many people don�t like CW/Still prefer MW they�d want to get their money from them, I�d buy another MW battle pass/new packs"
"It's rumoured that MW will get one more update to bring 3 new guns (Scorpion, Makarov and that LMG) and some new maps. Then it's done."
"I hope so, the absence of mw packs is bothering me.. especially since there's plenty datamined ones not released"
"My CW came with my new GPU and although i got it for free, i still think it is not worth it. I dont usually hate on COD's like majority of people every year, but even being an optimistic person myself, i have to admit, the game is just really really bad. The maps are actually good though. I think on average theyre better than MW maps."
Sadly no....MW is dead. The next Modern Warfare update wil be on Modern Warfare 2022 i think....Acti now they are making a game with 1 year life span and after they killed it with the new release...same will happen with Cold War this year after the release of the new CoD game
Do people expect MW Sequel to be 2022. Sledgehammer was supposed to release in 2020. That got scrapped in favor of treyarch coming in. Who�s working on 2021 cod then. Seems likely MW(2) will be pushed up to this year
Shut your whore mouth.
"Its always been like this. They release the games around October or November, they update it for exactly a year or so, then they stop releasing content and major updates to promote their next game. Happened to MW and it'll happen to CW this October. I couldn't recommend that anybody buy COD in 2021 unless they find some crazy good sale. Otherwise, its not worth it. But then again neither is CW. I would just wait for the reveal of the next COD this year and see if that appeals to you. If so, then invest in that one."
Thank you!
Why would you EVER want those ugly ass cdl skins in mw? Those were by far the worst thing ever added to call of duty.
"Idk i liked them, more so the 2020 pack, but I got into the game too late to get them. I really wanted the CODE pack, to support. But I wouldnt be able to even use most of the items, so dont see the point"
"In retrospect, I love the ACR BP for the Kilo 141, but boy is this thing big."
Do you need dead silence or can you make it without? Maybe hit the gap with a run slide?
"you can make it without dead silence, but you gotta time it perfect. i recommend dead silence, and knife."
The fuck did I just watch
A pro gamer move
I had no idea haha
would love to see more out of map plays haha
"High risk high reward, gonna try this later"
"It's because IW designed the game around Atmos in their engine and did a great job with the sound design in general. Go play CW with it on and it still sounds terrible if not worse with it on, I have to actually turn it off in that game to have even a remote chance of knowing the direction of footsteps in that game. Also PSA if your on Xbox One X (may apply to other xbox one's) Atmos creates a weird input delay like 80% of the time."
No cap i kept the subscription lol
Yeah it is great. Made my RoG G14 loud enough I don't even need headphones for footsteps. I hate wearing headphones I mute everyone anyway. Lol
"Idk, I had the trial on Xbox One and had to turn it off because I couldn't hear footsteps past 35m when the regular audio allowed all the way from 39m to 40m. Doesn't sound like a difference but when others have a 5m advantage it sucks. After turning atmos off I had much better foot step quality. I read a reddit post about settings in atmos to improve footstep audio and that's where some one recommended shutting it off. Keep in mind once I went as far and using a multi-band EQ and finding the different frequencies that the foot step audio played on and I went in to Atmos and boosted those specific frequencies with no improvement that equated to just shutting them off. I have a Rig700HX head set."
Why do people use the monolithic muzzle attachment instead of the integral barrel? Is it better?
I switch between the two but I prefer monolithic over the integral for some reason
nice dude
Thanks
I have cross play comms on and i don't have any parental controls on. idk why it still says disabled
It happens to some people
Do you know how to fix it
What do you mean like you uninstalled?
Just put auto tax sprint on
"This isn't really advice, this is just letting you know you're not alone.

This happens to me and has happened on and off throughout the entire time I've owned the game.    

For me it happens in about half the games now, when I used to only be able to sprint properly for the entire game about once in every ten games.   

/u/dongara221 suggested auto tax sprint on.   
I'm not sure if that's what I did, but I did start messing with the sprint settings and it started working for a bit.   

Every update I have to figure out a new way to get the sprint working.     

It's super frustrating as I've had to slow my game down because I like double time and dead silence, but the second my sprint doesn't work, I have to change my class to play without sprinting.  

I'm also not sure what save file /u/JazzlikeBake2327  is referring to, but I've never played anything other than multiplayer and have unistalled and reinstalled the game a few times to fix various other issues and never had my sprint fixed from that."
"Anytime I have weird game mechanics and graphical stuff going on that's not the usual bug, I rebuild database on the ps4 and most of the time it fixes stuff. Hope that helps and wouldn't hurt to try"
yes as long as you have the gun unlock but some blueprints run the risk of braking the Camo if you change attachments mainly the barrels do that
"You have to actually unlock the gun to change attachments, but if you do change attachments, 90% of them will clash a little bit because if you put, let's say, you got the Jack Frosty scar skin, which you can't buy, but if you put the normal barrel back on it, the normal barrel doesn't come with the shiney blue tone that the cqb barrel does.  It's honestly stupid and kinda sad."
"Yes but changing parts will not change apply the paint job to the new attachment. Say you have a blue barrel and put a different barrel on, it will be the normal black color"
Yes.
"Same, just went to check on how far I got with a camo challenge last night and now it's redownloading data packs. Luckily I checked. What gives? Does this mean it's uninstalled itself or am I just downloading the same stuff to copy over the stuff I already have? I tend to believe the former as it would already see the data packs are there and not go into crazy download mode."
Yo it�s good but bro cmon why would you choose that song bruh it�s IMO
"Not a giant fan of the song either, but I figured it would be easier to line up the audio with a song like this.  Also it's free lmao."
"Amazing stuff my guy, keep it up"
Thank you man.  I really appreciate it.
"its a good start, youll definitely want to try and get better framerates because the visual quality is a little crusty"
"Haha nice, I was waiting for the miss but it didn�t come"
Try plug in your headset into youre monitor instead of the controller. Made a difference for me
I use Bluetooth and my cord isn't long enough
Mmm I've  noticed it's a controller or headset thing I'm using a turtle beach headset audio settings are tweaked obviously but low boost is the best for hearing footsteps
I see. But why is this an issue with the official Sony ps headsets?
Try the �low boost� audio setting it helps a lot to hear footsteps. I switched to it a while back it makes footsteps way louder
"There is a Switch on the PS4 Gold Headset - the PS5 Pulse 3D also has this - where you can adjust the Chat/Game Audio - change the balance between these until you can hear the Ambient SFX.

Also: Do you have the same settings in the MW Ingame Menu on both Consoles?"
Yup
Buddy I hate to break it to you but it's been like that since day one.
"Yeah, day 1 of COD4."
"Nah, there was a flow. But it may have been happening for a while and I just didn�t take up notice"
I've noticed how bad it's getting as of late and it's very frustrating
"Well the big issue is that so many people want to be good, but aren�t willing to get bad. And with cosmetics all paid for it�s hard to flaunt your bling"
Maybe because the small map playlists are gone like shipment or livestock? so they all have to do them mounted kills on normal sized maps so they just sit at every corner.
Yeah but if it was that from the start and only a few I�ld be okay. This is like a switch flipped
what's sweaty tactics? lmao
"Jumping through doors, MP5�s/MP7�s kitted out for hip fire only, drop shoting, spawn locking, head glitching with the mounts, That broken Grau Set up."
The fix is buy cold war.
You work for activision?
First may wanna tell your buddy it�s for warzone and second he�s shit outta luck cause it�s in the battle pass
"It�s for warzone, what do you mean? I figured it was part of the battle pass, that sucks."
Which operator is pj? I really what to help but I don't know which one it is
It�s under Mil-Sim when you click on customize
What the hell is a pj skin
"US Air Force Para Rescue aka PJ

Edit: it�s a Mil-Sim skin, you can see it under the tab �US Pararescue�. PJ is the identifier patch worn by Pararescue Operators"
I feel this pain. i got shot out of a heli from like 200m with a usp yesterday lol
if you are playing on pc the ps exclusive skins only can be use on ps
thank you i didn�t know
"If the skin was exclusive to another console, you can't use it on a different platform. Playstation stuff won't work on PC or Xbox for example and just shows up as a base weapon."
ahhhhh thanks
"my box cutter no longer is shown, and even equipped in game doesn�t appear"
"No, that looks like a knife there.








/s"
The operator skins are only for Cold War and Warzone.
operator are for Warzone and Cold War the only thing you can use in all tree are the skins but they don't look that good on all weapons
"You can use camos on mw multiplayer as well, some of them look like missing textures but some of them are awesome, like amax or m4 etc, you need to keep trying to see which of them able to colorize"
CDL is not a sport in fact all esports leagues are not sports
"need team mates for warzone, multiplayer, zombies whatever 2v2 anything"
"Random tip. On the loadout you use to grind, put a launcher as your secondary and shoot shit down whenever you get the chance. It can take longer if your only trying to level up a launcher after you've finished everything else"
That�s what I�ve been doing. Is easier for me.
I�ve heard that I should do it just wasn�t sure so thanks for the input
One thing you should do right now is equipped launchers on all your secondary class. The launchers will 100% be annoying. I just finished Damascus yesterday. Should do the jokr first. As I find that it will take longer out of all the launchers because of the time to travel. Should finished the required AR first because their camp challengers do require more kills than the rest. Once you finished the RPGs everything else is light work.
Always max them out first. No point going for certain kills if they don't count.
"Thanks, I�ve been just maxing them out as I do them which is pretty exhausting. Maybe maxing them out and then going back will be a little more fun"
"Yeah max every gun during double exp weekends and stuff, will go by way faster and proactively grind the camos"
"Save yourself time and don�t do the DLC weapons, just do base game ones since DLC weapons don�t count toward Damascus."
Yeah I�ve been skipping those
Man....if only someone had told me sooner. Lol I maxed out all the dlc weapons first when I decided to go for the Damascus camo
"I leveled them all up first. I would have gone insane sticking with one gun that long. Just make sure you're working on the challenges as you level them up. Also, work on the launchers as you're working on the other weapons."
"So you went through them all and maxed them out, and then went back to the beginning and just finished off the challenges you didn�t get done on them?"
Do all 4 of the rocket launchers count towards Damascus?
I�m pretty sure
"Yes.  Here is a very helpful link for the grind requirements 
https://damascus.now.sh"
"I would definitely recommend maxing out the weapon before you grind it.  This way you can stack the challenges.  For example, while doing reptiles you can still get crouching, long shot and head shots and even doubles with the same hit. That�s 3-4 challenges at the same time so things will go a lot faster."
"Yes for launchers! For the guns it all depends on how good they are.  Im not a fan of the Sa87; i plan to fully level it up in plunder before trying to unlock the camos.  That LMG and I dont groove very well.

&#x200B;

Edit: On guns, once it fully leveled up do the ""no attachment"" camos first."
"Have been trying to get the launchers maxed, got the JOKR Done yesterday, just have kills with amped on rpg and haven�t touched Strella. Have had SA87 as my primary and I kinda like it, it�s almost like an AR"
i�ve been experiencing a bit more lag recently too
"Either that or it's made to force people to learn other ways of grinding Damascus  :)

You definitely have the right idea grinding launchers and melee early � especially with the riot shield you want to be able to just put it down when you start feeling burnt out, and switch to grinding a gun you like. Then switch back to riot shield when the gun's finished, and play through the pain some more until it burns you out again haha

I found I had the best success with launchers by playing Free-For-All (at least, when Shippy/Shooty/Rust wasn't available on tap).

Main a sniper or some other gun that you generally find tedious to use, and just switch to the launcher whenever an enemy pops up a Personal Radar or UAV. 

You can also grind the launchers for enemy kills if an enemy is camping in a window or around a corner with a close wall or ceiling that you can hit, BUT you might find campers are more useful for farming PR's and UAVs � if you know where someone is camping you can run toward them and die 4 times, *then* come back and kill them.

If they have Personal Radar or UAV equipped, they'll almost certainly fire it up after they respawn (if not as soon as they earn it). If so, then you can keep repeating that process throughout the match.

Or if not, then you can forget about them as they probably have high streaks you'll have trouble swatting with a JOKR.

Also efficiency tip: if you're grinding JOKR and you see someone else take down an air target with a PILA while you're trying to get your JOKR launched, just back out of the match. I guarantee you won't get a single JOKR hit on a killstreak if someone else is grinding a PILA in the same match, you're better off just finding a new hunting ground.

For melee you can actually grind riot shield 3-kill streaks pretty well in Domination on just about any map by camping somewhere safe that's near B-flag, and popping out for a quick kill when you notice the indicator changing, then turtling back to safety. 

Eg, Grazna Raid is huge but it's perfect for grinding riot shield threes if you play Domination � just camp in that green room above B-flag,  right at the top of the stairs (but around the corner so someone running up the stairs won't see you until they're running past you). Sit there and wait, then if someone starts taking B flag jump out the window, bonk 'em, then climb back up.

It helps to have stun nades & restock equipped."
I thought Uav's dont count towards the challenge
did my shield on livestock but im in the same spot for launchers now
Quick play.
"I was doing my weapon challenges for the rocket launcher its about 1,000 air streaks destroyed got the joker and another one done. Took forever to do in ground war"
Play Hardpoint for Jokr infantry kills. Aim for the HP surrounds and you're almost guaranteed to get kills.

"It's surely is an aimbot.
The way he/she instantly aims other players is too mechanical"
Aimbot.
"Were they on pc? Mouse movement can look �snappy� and the kill cams on this game are absolutely broken. Based on the kill cam (which suck), it does look like aim bot."
I play on console with cross play off and in the beginning of the round they were using deagles and only hit headshots
One killcam clip is not enough to tell. Killcams always look different than what the player sees
Good gaming chair
"Only brainlets complain about riot shields. They're so easy to counter. Stun grenades, semtex, Molotov, thermite, explosive crossbow, etc. Really any explosive that sticks to them. The riot shield has been a joke ever since they nerfed throwing knives."
My problem is when it's on the back. Especially when it's a teammate and he decides to stand in front of my while I'm shooting an enemy.
"tbh i sorta respect riot shield players, How tf can your run around knowing that:  
A. You cant shoot your enemy when you first see em  
B. How are you ok with your running speed  
C. switching weapons like constantly  


i personally just run smg and m4, so maybe i have no say in this, but god damn... yall have some fucking paciense"
"I have Damascus and I love executing, so I run the riot to do that, you really do have to master it because if you don�t, you stand almost no chance"
oh am a pussy and l use a riot shield
the desperate panic fire and throwing tacticals and lethals remind me all too well of blitz�s shield in siege
Ok I Did You Suck As A Joke Don't Kill Me Lmao
"I am one of those crazy people who uses the shield regularly (so here come the down votes I know) and proudly runs the obsidian camouflage on it.  I use two load outs, 1 with kali sticks for small maps and the other with an MP7 for bigger maps.  

Usually I keep the shield as my primary but will swap if I�m facing multiple opponents at the same time and can�t get around them or the distance is too great.  I have faced people try to go 3 against me, which is fine, so long as my team is able to flank them in response.  I may be sacrificed, but in the long run 3-4 of the other team went down with me.  While other times I have dominated with the shield, but nothing crazy, no 60 plus kills in a single game.

It can be a crazy powerful weapon in the right hands, but has some serious weaknesses which make it the most balanced weapon in the game.  Yes, thermite and Semtex can take a shield user out, but I�m rushing you when that happens because I�m going to take you down with me if possible.  I�m not always successful, but I love the reactions when I am.

A good shield player can be a strong support player for the team (emphasis on good) and turn the tide of the game.  However if all you�re doing is running it on your back, then I�m targeting you with everything I�ve got (restock with thermite and flash bangs for example)."
"Do what I do and run an RPG and throwing knives, that's what riot shields are ment for in that game. Double time, restock, amped, rpg, throwing knives and stuns. Plus the people who use shotguns with a riot shield are not true riot shielders."
Use the same perks.
"/r/CODWarzone is where you want to post this. 

I disagree with you, but the spawn rate should be reduced. Before I'd be lucky if I saw SP rounds in a game. Now it's normal to have it loaded on both guns with 1 in reserve. SP rounds and Self Revive are far far too common. Self revive shouldn't even be floor loot"
"No. Next you'll be saying that Ghost should only work when you're moving. Dead Silence in it's current state is well balanced, and Stopping Power is too. It would be one thing if they were perks and not field-upgrades, but you're just moaning because you're getting sauced on."
In Warzone it's a little busted yeah. In MP I agree DS is fine. I hate that Treyarch fanboys moan that MW is shit just cause DS isn't a perk.
No
Why would they do this
"AR:M4A1, As Val, AMAX.
SMG:MP7, MP5, Uzi
Those are my favourite"
Just use whats fun for you man
"AR:
M4
AS Val
GRAU

SMG:
Mp5
Uzi
Mp7"
"Ok lets do this!

AR

Kilo 141. It dosent hit that much but it's a laser beam. Super fun to use, agile, standard as hell. You could say the Grau 5.56 is in the same boat.

AMAX. Hits hard, kicks more. Now that said the recoil patern is not to bad. If you can manage it you'll shred.

M4A1. Classic. You can make it whatever you want. By definition THE modular weapon. Not to much recoil, all around good starts. Well used its a monster.

SMG

MP5. Gota start with this one as its the deadliest close range machine acording to a lot including me. Still relevant at mid range to. 

MP7. Ok. Think of an AR. With no recoil. Hits a little less. I run no stock on the thing and still shit on people mid range. Still relevant at short range. The iron sight is 10/10. Fun factor 10/10. I love the thing. 

Really check your classes set up tho. A little bit of a youtube check can help a lot to get that meta weapon. But definitely play around and check your options.

Hope you have fun!"
"ARs: AS Val, M4A1, and Amax, respectively. 
SMGs: Mp5, Mp7, and Uzi (with the other ammo attachment)"
"Ar: As-val, M4A1, Grau/Amax

AR:FAL SMG:fennec

"IMO From best to worst

1. Fal

2. Val

3. Amax

Smgs

1. MP5

2. Uzi

3. MP7"
"Tryhard: As val, amax, mp5
For fun (ik theyre not all ar's but): AK47, crossbow, kodachi/riot, oden, fr56 or whatever the famas is called"
"Meta Top3 AR: AS VAL, M4, AMAX
Meta Top3 SMG: MP5, MP7, Fennec

Most enjoyable to use? I like AN94, AS VAL single shot, and burst Fennec at the moment, yes I'm weird like that."
"Pretty shocked not seeing even one person saying the Ram. It�s literally a better M4 in every regard, with only slightly more recoil, strictly on account of having a faster fire rate than the M4. Better TTK, ADS, sprint to fire, same range, save for one meter, and same recoil pattern, just mirrored. The only reason you�d never see it in competitive play is because it was a banned for use gun"
"it doesnt have faster sprintout or faster ADS, it just fires a bit faster, while the m4 has lower recoil with a better pattern, m4 can have a 60 round mag and it has better ironsights."
Ram is better than the M4 but people don�t like the recoil so it gets left off. I�ve played with it a lot and it can definitely be tricky and if you change attachments a lot. Once you get it down it�s a beam and it handles better than a M4.
"AR:the FAL. its just great, its a 2 shot to upper torso and head and 3 shot to any other part. its a semi auto, of course, but it has quite controllable recoil and a very fast fire rate, so if you have a good trigger finger your'e gonna destroy everyone in close to mid range. even at longer ranges, with a scope this thing is awesome. Also was my countries military standard issue rifle until about 2014 so there's that.

SMG: the mp5. this thing has one of the fastest time to kill up close in the game. if you put some recoil attachments, this is very suitable for long range, and is just a beast in almost every area.

EDIT: grammar and spelling"
"Mp5, p90, bizen are my favorite smgs my favorite ARs would be the grau, and kilo"
"My favorite are in no means the best, but I�ll say them anyways.

AR: M13, Grau, and FAL.

SMG: MP5, MP7, Uzi"

"AR: M4 (jack of all trades, 4 shot beam with good handling) As Val (op 3 shot dlc gun) Amax (3 shot most ranges, slow handling but hits hard)

Smg: MP5 (fastest ttk and great handling) Uzi (best movement and range for smg 3 shot)"
"Uzi: Longest barrel, merc foregrip, 41 ie ammo, stippled grip tape/ 5mw laser, and No stock. 

This smg has one of the best movement speeds and it a reliable 3 shot within 30 meters."
"AR: Amax, m4, as val, (my favorite being the m13)

Smg: Uzi with 41 AE rounds, mp5, then mp7 probably

My recommended classes for my favorites:

M4: m16 grenadier barrel, commando foregrip, no stock, stipples grip tape, sleight of hand

Mp5: merc foregrip, monolithic barrel (not muzzle attachment), 10mm rounds, sleight of hand, stipples grip tape

Mp5 v2 super sweaty class: compensator, merc foregrip, sleight of hand, 10mm rounds, ftac collapsible stock

Uzi: longest barrel, 41 AE rounds, no stock, muzzle break, sleight of hand

Amax (bit slower than the m4): zodiac barrel, commando foregrip, skeletal stock, sleight of hand, tac laser or stipples grip tape

I play aggressively and think suppressors are a little overused, these are similar to the classes pros would run (they really only used the m4 and mp5)"

Killing someone who�s mid sprint then milling two people from behind and getting one regular kill! Wowza! Tough task to achieve! You going pro soon?
i meant in a funny way because ive never executed someone in the middle of a potg before
If you�re on mouse and keyboard and type another language I sometimes accidentally switch the language by holding alt and shift together and it doesn�t type in chat maybe that will fix it
So you're saying I should try holding alt and shift together? Sorry I'm a little slow at this.
If you talked shit then you might have gotten it revoked.  I�ve had my communication privileges revoked for like a day once.  If ur mic still works then it sounds like it�s a weird bug
"Well I was in a game and my teammates were all talking shit because they didn't like the weapons I was using and I was playing pretty bad that night. So I typed in public chat, ""I'm just gonna mute my dumbass teammates"" and so I did. They were all a group and backed out right before the game ended."
"If the text chat is still disabled I'll give the mic a whirl, thanks!"
In tdm on a guy probably just trying to do longshot camos so hes not gonna move... Yeah ima have to disagree. Its good but not legendary.
Nothing has changed since the release of Cold War.
I still find matches just fine.
"With crossplay you�ll find matches in every game mode, even spec ops"
"> even spec ops

Wait how."
"You can find matches pretty easily, but you will run into a lot of lopsided games.  I think there is enough to keep playing, but not enough to make fair teams very often."
"If you don't ragequit every other match you shouldn't get many games that you don't get to start from the beginning. Really like how they did it actually, constant (rage)quitters are forced into playing shittier matches until they learn not to be sore losers. Also, yeah fuck random nades, those things are goddamn cancer on one-life modes especially"
"It definitely seems like that sometimes but recently ive noticed that if youre facing a clan/squad, after 1-2 rounds of losing my teamates will slowly start putting on their mics and start trying"
"Still plenty. I play hardcore, which I assume has a significantly smaller playerbase than core, and can still find matches under 100 ping almost always pretty constantly. With crossplay on at least"
"I have no problem with MW.
And still find matches just fine."
"Honestly, heaps of matches. Haven�t had an issue finding a game, even at times like 4am - 6am. AU"
"I'm on PC. Never an issue finding lobbies.

I know people hate cross play but it has saved CoD on PC. Please don't turn it off my dear console friends. I love you all."
i can easily find a game on ps4
scope glare is a big NO
Yeh wtf you doing with a sniper scope on that? Especially without a foregrip to help steady sustained fire. The only way I can see use for this is HC modes and tap firing but the Scar and AK fill that niche way better.
"Sniper scope on an AR, really? M13 has always felt like a pea shooter to me. Prefer the Grau or Kilo if you like the stability."
Wish it could 4 tap at short range
I have been using it in hardcore and i get a ton of easy kills
Bless you and help me too
Jesus Christ the XM4 sounds like a god damn nerf gun
"I just came here to see if someone else is on the same boat, I have been unable to connect the whole day"
Finally got an error code that answered my question turns out it�s a backend issue :/
Had to leave an ongoing match in Broadcast due to rubber-banding. I can't even join my team to fight against our enemies and I feel like a hinderance to them.
"I gotta say, I'm not exactly surprised that MW2019 looks better."
That is obvo
I wonder how far mobile phones are from having ps4 graphics?
Give it about 2 -3 years and we�ll see a old cod campaign for mobile
Getting closer each year

When BOCW first released I ran into a few people using CW guns in MW multiplayer
"Really? I�m guessing that because the weapons and characters are in warzone, which is the same engine, they are also in MW but not accessible unless it glitches"
Adler and woods were added to mw multiplayer before Cw came out for people who preordered the game
"I knew woods was in the game, but I didn�t know Adler was too. 

However, I don�t own Cold War in the first place, so I�m assuming it was just a glitch?"
You do anything to the PC prior the issue? Driver updates? Change any settings?
"actually yes, I watched a video on how to speed up my pc and I changed my virtual memory amount but then realized it wasn�t helping so I changed it back to defaults. I also changed my pc off of fast boot time because i saw sometimes it can do the opposite. Besides that everything is the same."

"IMO, even if you disregard the whole Zombies storyline, both the Modern Warfare '19 and Black Ops timelines don't exactly match.

I mean, what about the future part of Black Ops II? How would the sudden technology increase would be justified from 2019 to 2025? Unless they're going to retain Black Ops II?

Would have preferred if Black Ops Cold War were a reboot of the Black Ops universe and then connect that to Modern Warfare, but that's just me."
"Yea, that would've been the ideal route for me as well.  Since BO3, I feel that the Black Ops name is just there because they feel that the games wouldn't be able to stand on their own (rip ghosts, IW, AW)."
Are BO2-4 still canon? They could always just say BOCW+MW is a different timeline to Bo2-4
I�d honestly just consider anything zombie related non-canon. Modern Warfare wise the next bit story wise is Soap meeting up with Price and the gang.
"So here's where we need to have a bit of an understanding regarding the Zombies Aether story's ending, and a general concept of multiverse-related stories and how they work:

First, the Aether story ended by having the original Aether multiverse collapse, and a new universe is created in its place. This universe is implied to be the MW2019/BOCW one where every story is intertwined (Campaign + MP + Warzone + Zombies). This, in a way, allows COD to start fresh and lay the ground works for an interconnected universe.

Second, stories involving multiverses have always had a form of ""selective reboot"" where past stories may be retconned to fit the new narrative. It does not mean the old story isn't relevant anymore, it just exists in its own bubble. Like the plot of Avengers Endgame, time travel doesn't mean you change history. You just create new timelines where history diverges, while your main one keeps on going (or ends, depending on how you feel about it).

So in a way, this could be where COD is headed. The Black Ops series from 1 to 4, and the original MW trilogy, as well as every other one-time COD titles, are in their own respective bubbles. Whereas the new rebooted universe will take certain aspects from BO1, maybe BO2 (like Woods escaping Vietnam in 1972), plus MW2019, and work from there to craft a new story. Hence why Kravchenko is now researching zombies. Hence why the Menendez cartel witnessed a zombie outbreak on their facility. This does not invalidate BO2 in any way, BO2 simply exists in a separate bubble now."
"I have a feeling they might connect it through the zombies, we have already been shown with zombies modes that that material can outright warp people to different time and places so it might drag everyone into the past for the next map and they might even use zombies to connect them to the next (sledgehammers 2021 cod possibly ww2 or 1950s) as they transition to that map. Then come full circle with a reset with ""MW2 2022"" to a new engine, new modern Warzone."
"Let�s face it, the zombies theme was the best thing in cold war...in the story, in multiplayer...etc"
Pretty sure zombies already connects them.
"Lol wait you gotta be joking about the story of mw being good, cold war's story was actually interesting other than another ""KILL THE RUSSIANS!!!"" story. Psychological shit in cold war and the many different sequences on the mind game mission. MW2 is going to have zombies and you and all the crybabies are gonna deal with it"
"To each their own, I never disliked Cold War's campaign.  I said it was worse which is a subjective take.  I'm not going to argue one is better than the other based on some arbitrary ""objective"" standard, but I am stating an opinion.  

What ""rustles my jimmies"" is zombies' influence on both (but primarily MW as I prefer it) campaigns.  Also I ain't crying man lol.  I bought both games and enjoyed their campaigns.  I'm enjoying zombies' gameplay, just disagree with the story direction being taken."
"Both are good. Modern Warfare was a grounded (if not overly pro-US, anti-Russian) war drama, while Cold War�s an action-packed cheesy 80s movie. Not sure that it�s the most �psychological� game, but it was fun. So was MW."
"I only just unlocked it a few days ago, had the game since it came out im just lazy lol. 

I played mostly on Ground War, and some of the �What Objective� mode. Ground war, if a flag is being contested, I chuck a smoke down and can usually get a few kills per game. The smaller modes can be easier with maps like shoothouse, so I�d recommend doing things like headquarters. 

I personally switched between using the Holger and the Finn to unlock it. I ran a Holger with 30rnd mags and a thermal, as well as no stock and a tac laser so I could ads as quick as possible. This works well for tossing the smoke far away and shooting anyone who passes through. I ran a FINN with a chainsaw setup whenever I got a map like shoothouse since I could hip fire spray in close quarters and still be accurate. 

I hope this helps, sorry if this is rambling I�m not good at putting things into words lol"
"Yup, thermal/NV optics are your best friends here! 
It's quite painstaking process but you'll get it!"
"Try games like hard point and domination as they lead to a central point and you can spawn easier.  Stick with smaller maps like vacant and Hardhat and of course take advantage of rust, shoot house, or shipment when they come up."
"Shoot House was always just as efficient as Shipment. 

You have to be in the smoke, not the enemy. So you can just mount that center wall, toss a smoke at your feet, and hope to get a couple kills with a thermal scope before the smoke clears (or before an enemy with a thermal picks you off haha)

So in general the same applies to any map that tends to be good for grinding longshots � Hardhat, Khandor, Euphrates, Grazna, Azhir, etc. 

Hardhat, Khandor, and Azhir are all especially good for grinding longshots if you play Free-For-All and camp the right spots. 

So just adapt the normal longshot grinding technique to include smoke at your feet. (Restock helps, as well as keeping Munitions Box as your field upgrade.)"
What Mazda is that?
Mazda? Help me out here.
"Can you use it in multiplayer? /s

Can you use it on coop?"
You can use it in survival along with the sykov
"Same thing. I unlocked it in previous season, but i still can't use it. I don't know why IW don't release new guns"
"Because they�re assholes who drip feed content. The CX-9, which seems to be the CZ Scorpion EVO 3, has been in the game files for MONTHS. If I remember clearly, before Season 2/3/4, someone on this subreddit was using an unfinished Scorpion EVO gun in a private match. The gun was all white since the asset wasn�t finished.

I�m like 99.99% sure we�ll be getting these new guns when Cold War Season 2 finishes which is like a month. I�m sure we�ll be getting Season 7 for MW as well by the time that happens."
Can you still get it?
Yes. Two long shot kills with smgs in 5 matches
"So they're tracking again or it's an old clip?
Because i want to unlock the RAAL and Sykov even if i only can use them in Survival"
I don�t think that you can unlock the RAAL yet. Only the sykov and cx9.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCJCTqBsgzvo8Khbxx-vLCiw
https://youtu.be/M1eIkypGwMU
is this recent? i just played 5 (backed out after getting 2 longshots) and didnt get anything
It doesn�t count if you back out. It didn�t track for me when I was backing out.
"I remember one regular Ground War match on Karat River Quarry where I shit you not, the enemy team just camped on the mountain overlooking the map. They were like the mujahideen, sniping and getting kills with the tanks."
Tanks are annoying af but they shouldn't remove the Hellis. This needs to be the default GW playlist
"Nah, free tanks are stupid and ruin the mode. Always happy to see them go. 

Helicopters are great, though. Miss those. Rovers almost do as good as them, but not quite."
"That�s why I always checked out of ground war when this game. I can play any of the other variants including realism. But this one you�ll always end up spawn camping, or being spawn camped. There�s no way out of it."
Ground War could be replaced with online TDM and I would be the happiest
You should break up the launchers.. or at least try do them as your doing other guns.. I left them all til last and it was horrible!
What made it horrible? I was planning on doing those last
To get my lmgs maxed out I did hardcore shoot the ship with xp tokens. But lately it seems like activision only deals out the shit maps that no one likes
Fr hoping next playlist update gives us something decent
"Yeah defenitly take Lauscher As your secondary as long as you dont got them Gold. Its one of the most Important parts.

Do AR early they are annoying afterwards"
Should I max them out before I use them as my secondary?
"Tbh I do really like CW, after the trial I ended up buying it. That said, MW is absolutely more fun. It�s not as fast paced, but the movement and graphics are unlike any other COD. But they always abandon their previous games. They�re keeping up with this one more than the other times a new one came out and the old was abandoned though."
"I personally don't like cw just for the graphics alone, with all the gameplay I've seen it just looks like a major downgrade from mw, and the guns just, seem eh, where as in mw they felt, looked, and sounded amazing. 

But I do like cod in general since it's a good time waster so I'll probably eventually get cw once mw fully dies because I have a feeling that time will be soon and I don't wanna make the mistake of getting the game twords the end of it's cycle like I did mw"

"Jev doesn't prefer modern warfare over cold war at all idk where you got that from lol, he treats cold war as a bo1 remastered in one of his vids. he says so many times in his videos that modern warfare wasn't good.    Stop spreading false info lol and no one cares stop trying to get upvotes"
ok
This your first cod? Also Jev doesn�t even play modern warfare anymore I�m pretty sure he can�t stand the game at this point
"> I don't know why Activision or whatever is abandoning mw like they are

For the same reason as every other Call of Duty in the past sixteen years. They're busy working on a sequel to MW19 now, as that would make them far more money then they would ever make from continuing to support MW19, as proven time and time again.

How people didn't see it coming is beyond me, considering it has been done without fail for every game since the original COD4 in 2007."
You got the execute.  And what did it cost. The potg
And where did that bring you? Back to potg.
That sweat's trigger finger is dangerous
FAL is the sweatiest gun in the game bar none
I recently posted a clip of it prefire cap nerf. Was God-Tier before the YouTubers made meta videos about it.

That guy needs to calm down lol
I wish they would add this execution to all characters instead of just Price
That or the cinderblock one
ouch...lol!
That's a badass kill
This is great

"Thats not me! Im Captain Price in this video. But i got blue dot since season 2 among with almost all final reticles (except thermal, which i dont use)"
a sad ending to a great gameplay
FAL is the most underrated gun in the game
Having the same issues shit is mad annoying
"\#metoo

what did they here?"
Been having the exact same problem since last year. Found absolutely no help as of yet
"Oh hell no lmao
Edit:thought I was on the Cold War sub MW split screen is great!"
Split screen doesn�t always work for me. It would start to load a match and then freeze and the game would crash.
"have you played it recently? like 2, 3 days ago?"
You need to have a pretty good tv for it to work right otherwise it�ll run at like 10fps or just straight crash
If your tv peaks 60fps@1080 it will probably crash
They locked the way to get them and they reset levels
Ok thanks
"Are you talking about core multiplayer? They haven't been added to the game yet. Those missions to unlock them have been there forever but just disabled. We don't know when they'll be added, if ever."
It�s not a limited event right? Why would it be? You can unlock guns forever.
It�s more of the fact that they aren�t in the full game and can only be accessed in survival and they don�t show how much you�ve progressed in unlocking them. So they might have patched it so you can�t unlock them.
They ignore armor and one shot without E.O.D. The only thing is you can crouch under them
Or block the explosion with a riot shield.
He probably just crouched and it let him avoid dying
how about no

That was spicy
"When I first was learning how to quickscope, I took a magic marker and ADS'd and held my breath to find my screen center and put a little red marker dot where that was.  When you are not ADSing you can see the dot without it getting in your way playing the game.  When you come up on somebody, put the red dot on them while you ADS and pull the trigger.  After you get comfortable with it, the dot can be washed off the screen using fingernail polish remover."
"For low zoom I recommend staying on default (which is 1) the lower sensitivity helps to lock onto people a lot. And I usually stay on 1.35-1.40 for high zoom. Precision aim assist is great for sniping it has a very strong slowdown when ADS but it�s absolute shit for any other weapons. I play 10 horizontal and 10 vertical sensitivity, it�s personal preference but I manage to hit shots way easier using these settings when sniping"
Alright what would you recommend for high zoom sensitivity?
"With modern TVs, the difference is becoming negligible since new TVs are basically big monitors. 
But like the last guy said, response time is the big difference. 

Since you're playing on a PS4, I don't know what the output limits are for that system, and for that game. Consoles are usually capped on graphics and framerate to make a balanced and stable output. so it doesn't get all choppy with high res graphics or look too horrible just to get good FPS.

On a PC (and depending on the PC's specs) you can adjust your settings, jack up your resolution, FPS, etc and easily take advantage of your monitors high framerate and the short response time. 
For example, one of the games I play on PC, I went with max settings for all the graphics and that lowered my framerate to be in the 80fps range. My monitor is 144hz and has a sub 1ms response time. So my monitor is actually restricted in what it does based on the limitations of my PC's output.

On PS4, I suspect you're probably capped for frame rate output and resolution. 
So if the PS4 is capped at 60fps (for example, I don't actually know) and your monitor/ TV is at least 60hz, you're already getting maximum output on your monitor for FPS.

Regarding refresh rate or response time, a lot of newer TVs are around 10ms response times, gaming monitors are down to sub 1ms. 
The lower your response time the less motion blur or tearing you'll get on screen. I'm not about to do the math, but going on with presuming your PS4 is doing 60FPS, even a 10ms response time, which is 1/100th of one second, you still have a better response time than available input from your PS4.

I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in any of this, but these dudes in the video below do some good videos explaining response time, framerate, etc, and they explain it a lot better than me I'm sure.

https://youtu.be/Sxvu7qf6rDw

Hope some of this helps"
Thank you
"The first thing is Response time which is basically a delay. 

1ms ... is arguably a non-existent delay. 

Even a crappy LCD with a 15ms delay, your gonna have a relatively hard time feeling the difference. 

Arguably the most noticeable difference is seeing more, and what I mean by this is when you�ve got yourself a 24-27� inch monitor, your don�t have to move your head/neck nearly as much to see all of the screen. 

When your sitting on a couch looking at 65� TV. Small details like a guy peaking a window 100m away in the top right of your screen are pretty easy to miss, especially when your tunnel visioned on the Center screen. 

But these small details like the guy peaking  are much more noticeable when your nice and close to a small monitor. 

And lastly, pixel density.

At 1080p, their are only 1920 x 1080 pixels. So when you look at, let�s say a 55� TV... the Pixel per square inch is about 40. While the pixel density of a 24� monitor is about 91. 

The TV won�t look terrible, because your sitting 6ft away from it, but if you say let�s say 3 ft from both the TV and monitor, the TV would look absolutely terrible. 

Sitting closer to a higher cluster of pixels make those fine details (like the guy peaking a window 100m example) much more detailed."
So if I want to be able to see someone from a further distance if I'm playing warzone for example on a tv that said person would be much more difficult to see then if I was in front of a monitor.
Monitors will more than likely have a better response time
What do you mean could you give me an example?
"Monitor have a refresh rate of 60-240hz and response time of often under 1 ms, while big lcd screens mostly have refresh rates of 24-60hz and refreshing rates of up to 10ms. This is no problem for Movies and television, but it will definitely limit its gaming performance"
Oh gotcha thx for telling me :)

What do these complaints and autism have in common?
"The post could have been ""Things a person who drinks water dislikes about Modern Warfare"""
"He's just venting but also saying that it's his own opinion, feel free to disagree because he knows he's not the perfect player. Just a bit of humor to his vent."
i feel like anyone should be able to use whatever weapon they want. i wont rage. just keep a loadout to counter it like a thermite class to combat riot sheild. just run eod to counter rpgs. and i love quickscoping! its an integral part of cod! it sounds like u just want everone running around with m4s and kilos
You sound chill af. Would be down to run a few games w u whenever ur free!
What do you think about my point about the pros not limiting themselves? I think it makes the game more enjoyable and it means new player won�t get put off
"Given the fast TTK in (practically any) CoD game, you simply cannot avoid single shot snipers (speaking of when shot at most parts of the body). Just imagine if your sniper would not be single shot, before you rechamber your gun, the enemy is either gone or has killed you. This makes sniper in terms of game design very hard yet interesting to balance properly."
"1. If sniper rifles weren't OHK, they'd be massively underpowered and useless in CoD in general as there are few to no long-range sniper friendly maps in these games.

2. So, what? Our MODERN warfare games should uninclude rocket launchers because some people can't get over being killed in one shot? It's not like making them 2HKs would stop people from using them; you can look at the BF franchise and it's pitiful RPG splash damage for evidence of that.

3. Why the hell should anyone limit their own performance? I get that you're autistic, but most people aren't and aren't going to play the game the same way they would play tag with someone with a severe mental handicap; they're here to win, not make sure everyone is having fun."
Hardcore is much more balanced weapon wise. But it doesnt seem like youre ready for it if youre complaining about RPGs & ppl simply being better than you.
"> Hardcore is much more balanced weapon wise. 

lolno; most weapons become 1-2hk weapons which is massively unbalanced when most weapons can run around with 60-100 round mags/drums. HC boils down to ""who can camp the best"" rather than ""who is best at shooting."""
Same issue. Can�t believe this is happening
I don't think there enough players left for it to be sweaty.  Almost every game is totally lobsided.  You're either going to kick the shit out of a team or they are going to wipe the floor with you.  No point in sweating anymore. Quikscoping is pretty rampant.  There is always at least 2 on your team and 2 on the other team doing it in every game.  You might run into a riot shield once in every 20 games or so.
That..sounds better then last time I played..there used to be dudes camping with C4 well there buddy blocked you with a riot sheild
Quickscoping and 1 team wiping the floor with another team that sounds pretty sweaty to me.
"Back when MW2 came out I realized I didn�t play the games for fun, I played them for the exciting rush of revenge >:).  This is one of the sweetest parts of gaming.  Also proving yourself able to overcome a failure!"
Helping out the team is a thankless job sometimes *reloading sniper*
Classy

Someone doesn�t understand what DDOS is
That�s what I�m thinking . Shouldn�t he have been booted ? I always thought DDOSing would bring down your router and crash your internet for a few hours
And thats why I Uninstall that game and stuck with tarkov or  cw zombies. So many DDOS in the 2v2 matches or SND
"Meh, who gives a shit anymore, they'll only wipe it again when CoD21 comes out."
Agreed. After season one I don�t give a fuck about prestige or leveling it means nothing with the way they have it set up.
"For real. There is not a single shred of evidence that MW even had a ranking system. They don't even have a legacy page to view all the challenges you completed 

My career level was over 900 and that just got wiped completely. I'm guessing their post-life plans changed due to warzone and integrating MW and CW."
They could've left it out. Didn't look at this one
Dude spam posting this daily isn�t gonna get it fixed just be patient
It's probably not even a bug. Probably some dumb attempt at subliminal messaging to get you to want to play Cold War
"Exactly my thought! Such a scummy move. I like the game but small shady stuff like this makes me wanna uninstall for good. Not that it would make a difference but still. 
Go to hell Activision"
"Prestiges are fucking worthless (other than those tier skips)

Should have added back the old season officer challenges, like for example I only started playing during S3, would have loved to complete the older challenges too."
"Season Office Challenges are completely useless and that comes from someone who completed them since S0. 

By far the worst mechanic they've added in an attempt to not add Prestige. Also heads up, Prestige within CW has this challenges that you can actually go back and finish as long as you reached the *Prestige Master* of that season.

In CW it looks like this https://i.imgur.com/sEVKAVi.jpg although in MW it is stuck at Prestige 9 and the UI is messed up lol"
"That's your career level. You just didn't max out at some point. So that's truly on you, friend."
No
Who me?
why do the graphics look really crumby and grey?
Idk I have a aorus cv27q monitor Ryzen 9 3900xt cpu and a 2080super and hdr enabled maybe it�s the obs recording I�m using maybe it�s the pc idk
Quickest fix is to just restart the router and that usually does the trick
Turn UpNP on in your router settings if the forwarded ports didn't help. Also double check if the you inputted the ports correctly cuz its gotta be formatted perfectly for it to work
"Night maps make it a lot sneakier, make it a rule to not use the goggles"
Roze operator on that would be overpowered
"I don't play hardcore but do play domination regularly and tbh it's less fun to be content to just hold two flags, camp the lanes and spawn trap for the win. On smaller maps it's a lot more fun to see how long my team can completely dominate and hold all 3 flags."
I'm fine with that at long as there's a healthy lead.
"I like to play domination aggressively by going for all three flags all the time, A then B then C, repeat all game. Had lots of real close games and a few draws. I have the most fun when both teams are going for all three all the time, it's fast paced and wild that way, I'm never going to be content with two flags and I don't enjoy playing the game just holding flags watching the score go up"
"I agree on most points, just not as strongly as you. Accept that newer players are still doing camo challenges. I quit after season 3 and recently came back with 11 weapons to get Damascus on. You also forgot that if you don't cap B, you likely won't win."
"I partially agree about the rockets and streaks.  My problem is teammates running into my streaks and rockets like they�re playing core.  I finally stopped using anything beyond UAV�s because of that idiotic behavior getting me killed 3-5 times because they want to stand in the middle of my cluster strike.

When I see shield grinders, I try to help, but now I intentionally run to them when I have 4 kills just so they can get a buzzkill challenge and my team is going to get me killed if I use it.

It has reached a point where I have stopped playing hardcore."
"I had to do much the same, I restricted myself to controllable streaks so I don�t have any accidental kills (or team kill suicides).

Personally I love hardcore though, it�s more balanced in my opinion because the overs weapon meta means less overall and you can use what you�re good at and still remain competitive."
holding just 2 flags is boring. i almost always go for the 3rd
My advice would be find some players who have knowledge of the game and party up with them. Players in respawn are dogshit when it comes to  playing objectives.
Good job
"Try ground war, it�s almost like lmgs were made for it. Add all the range attachments and camp up somewhere, you can easily beam anyone"
I only play hardcore but maybe try a other game modes that have one objective like hardpoint or capture the flag. Im assuming everyone would be rushing the objective and you would be defending it
I usually just play domination and camp flags
I did all the LMGs in Ground War. Was able to get a 3.5+ kd with all them. They�re great there.
"Domination and hard point are great modes, but I would say try core instead of hardcore.  I got almost all of mine to fold that way and my grind was without shoot house or shipment.  Find a good spot to mount and you can get long shots at the same time.  I ran the barrier field upgrade so I hade a portable mounting location.

In core it takes more hits to kill, but it also takes more to get killed.  So after long shots and reptiles are done, set them up for fast mobility and aim speeds."
"This is gonna be weird, but after grinding ARs, LMGs felt really easy for me. Well... I'm still grinding them, but they feel really more enjoyable due to the small amount of things to do per gun compared to the atrocious numbers of ARs. I've gotten 3/4 in core just playing the game modes i usually play (tdm, dominium, hardpoint, ffa, kc)"
"Hardcore dom, or hardpoint. Those games go for the longest time and give you more chance to get kills in a game. TDM is not the way. Lmgs are pretty much 1 shot any range."
I�ve been wondering the same thing actually.
"I use the game capture feature in Windows 10 that saves the last 30 seconds (it's a setting you can increase up to 10 minutes) when I press a hotkey. I haven't noticed an impact in performance.

[https://iili.io/qIUr8v.jpg](https://iili.io/qIUr8v.jpg)"
"I use OBS with the replay buffer feature. Shadowplay sucks because it captures every active audio device on your system and there's no way to change it, so if you're listening to music or have a stream playing with the audio routed to the motherboard sound and the game on a separate headphone amp it still records everything and ruins the clips. I have Highlights turned off because 90% of what it decides to record is junk and it consumes copious drive space.

With the encoder settings I'm using (NVENC on a 3070, 9mbps CBR, 1080p) the quality is [more than acceptable](https://crap.site/nvenc-example/) and each ~2 minute clip from the buffer uses around 190mb. Shadowplay's default ""high"" settings uses about 1.2gb for 5 minutes, and while it's basically lossless that's not useful because most video hosting mangles bitrates which means more work than I really care to do for a ~30 second long clip. As it is now all I need to do is remux it and trim the junk off the ends in ffmpeg, then upload.

The encoder in your 1070 isn't quite as advanced as the ones in the 1660 and later cards, you'd probably need to use around 12mbps or maybe a little more to get the same visual quality."
"Your talking about OBS Studio I take it.   Hmmm yea I know the graphics cards have improved but each time I think about upgrades damn Bitcoin takes off the the data miners drive prices up, availability nil.  ;|"
I don't think Ghost ever used the M4 apart from maybe The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday. The ACR was definitely more iconic with Ghost and MW2 in general. I distinctly remember him using it in Loose Ends.
"I'm pretty sure that the M4 is not a part of the pack.
You get a blueprint for a different gun that looks like the MW2 ACR"
 yes you may be right  about that.
He has it in Takedown.
Classic ghost skin is sick
I bought MW2CR a few days ago and I love that M4! Use it in every MP game rn. Tried to make it work in warzone but the barrel is unusable tbh.
Now if they would use the correct voice for ghost it would be perfect.
"Silly question, but where did u get the M4 blueprint? I got the skin but don�t remember getting that M4"
You can get it by buying Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered. It's just the Campaign tho so it has no multiplayer
Man I love the M4. It�s one of my favorites in the whole game.
I know how to ger that M4 but how do you get the classic ghost skin? was it just a regular bundle from a few seasons ago?
"Yeah. There�s a Kilo-141 blueprint called Ghostly Premonitions, if you find it in the armory you can buy the bundle there. There�s also a blueprint for the X16 called Draugr which you can also use to buy the bundle. It should be around 2400 COD Points."
"COST OF THE BUNDLE PLS, I HAVE BEEN SAVING MY COD POINTS INSTEAD OF SPENDING THEM ON THE BATTLE PASS"
2400cp for sure
"You ghost fanboys can downvote me all you want, but that�s one derpy ass face mask and you know it."
yeah but is still looks cool
Better than the MW19 airshit mask
"nah, new Ghost�s face mask is goofy. looks like he picked it up at Party City"
I remember doing that myself and getting booted back to the main screen. In my defense I thought the baby was trick.
"I mean, I didn't want my cover blown by the little bastard"
Please explain how a baby could be a trick and the game would actually want you to kill it?
Why does she look so buff
She has a heavy front load so her back is yoked
Power of anime on her side...and the minigun but mostly anime
What mode is this
Looks like survival
"It�s spec ops survival, you can do a glitch where your operator is stuck in third person mode. It looks great but you�re basically hipfiring every shot since you can�t actually ADS haha. Search �mw survival third person glitch� on YouTube it should come up, if you wanna try it"
"My Mara, wot a gurl!"
Meow
Why would the simps have guns
Looks like Gina Carano
Can�t believe she got fired for having a different opinion
Damn
Those missions are broken. IW no longer supports the game so i dont think they will be fixed.
Not true moron
Was that the flash bang or the knife? Or both
The knife
"Same issue, had just gotten back into sniping and now it�s pointless due to texture issues."
"That�s distance based LODs. It�s not that it won�t load, it�s how optimization works. It takes into account your actual distance, not magnification."
Is there anything that I can do to change the optimization? I remember not being bothered by this at the beginning of this game.
"This happens all the time for me, although it usually renders in after a few seconds."

"Just the past few days?

Been like that since the Cold War launch for me.

To be fair it's been a lot better in the last few weeks, but still happens sometimes."
"I used to get it occasionally, like once every few games and now it's once every few seconds."
Ive had the [exact same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NEg5Kb_PbU). As far as I know it went away by itself. I absolutely have no clue what caused it and what fixed it.
"Yeah I want to fix it but I've tried everything, I've also heard it can have to do with your ISP"
That yellow symbol with the 3 squares stays on the left side of my screen and I slightly lag from time to time. The internet that I have isn�t terrible as I get like 60 mbps but it is wireless so I guess that has more to do with it.
I get more than 200 down and I tried to jump in and play a match today and it was 50x worse than what you see above
Are you on ps4? I've had this issue before as well and hard turning off the machine (not test mode) did the trick
"Wym by hard turning off, like fully turn it off not rest mode?"
I'm on PC
"Yep, it has been there in the past and was gone.

It�s back now (haven�t played for a few days but guess since the latest update). Unplayable"
Are you playing wireless?
Wired connection.
"For me every MP match is a lottery: I will either have 50 ping or 300. These are the two options. When I only have to abandon every second match in a day, I am happy."
"The yellow symbol above the three orange boxes means you are getting actual packet loss or desync. 

The orange boxes by themselves don�t typically cause lag. 

There must be something on your end causing the desync. I see the packet burst squares frequently but never get major desync like that."
"Yes, in that particular clip there is a packet loss indicator but nine times out of ten it's only the three orange boxes and I experience stutters just as severe, I'm in the process of diagnosing my network"
"Have ( or had since I gave up on fixing it ) the same issue. Tried basically everything in the book. 

Two things I have concluded though is it is either the ISP (I'm under Spectrum, at the end of my internet line no less, lucky me) and/or how the game is optimized to handle these sort of packet burst. 

The game has only gotten worse since the devs decided to start ignoring these issues."
Yep. I'm under spectrum and it's the only ISP I have accessible to me in my area. I've read that this could be the issue and I didn't want to believe it.
"i had the same issue since i got my pc back in november. Tried alot of things, a program names HASTE fixed it for a while (is like exitlag but free), lowering the v-ram use to 5.5 or 6.5 fixed it for a while, i have no idea how to fix it, cold war was working fine, but for the last couple of days i get some freezes from time to time like 1-2 secs.  


It is not my internet, i am  sure of that, is working just fine on my ps4, it has something to do with my settings or the game itself."
I have 4 stun grenades and just spam them on rose campers.
"Replace flashes with stuns, replace molotovs with pre-nerf C4, and have an rpg 7 sidearm for maximum effect"
"Stuns are worse honestly, much higher chance of them killing you since they can still see and aim to an extent."
I�d spam report the fuck out of you.
Then when it comes to reporting someone real nothing gets done because of this. Niiiiice.
im gonna vomit
"I have a load out like that just for spawn campers.  But in your case, yeah...you deserve to burn."
It was even better when I got a squad of randoms to party up and roll out as a six man squad doing this.
I'm calling the cops on this crime
Ew
I'm surprised those concussive grenade launchers didn't become spammed like crazy in both Multiplayer and Warzone although i suspect is cuz the limited ammo capacity and needing to run fully loaded just to get two shots in multiplayer.
"Pkm.  200 rounds.
Overkill
Kilo. under barrel  smoke launcher  and 100 round mag
Smoke grenades 
Thermites
Field upgrade ammo box for more smoke on launcher, smoke grenades and thermites
Run specialist and get Restock, more smoke, more thermites. ;)"
"My pain in the ass class is the Slaughterhouse PKM, but I swap the sight out so I can equip FMJ instead so I can 200rd belt dump everything I find, it�s cancerous how long I shoot without stopping for entire games."

fucking monster
People who play like this are the most annoying

If you play with a mk2 I can forgive every quickscoper
bad take
????
I respect this kind of sniping or with the Ax-50 or HDR but once it comes to clips of the Spr I just wanna report the whole dam clip. It�s not a sniper period. Anyways good shit bro!
Yeah i dont like the spr
"""tried sniping for a day"" and mf has platinum on snipers. Smh"
Yeah i got them plat a while back then stopped
 Oh woooooooooooooow look at that mad fucking SKILLLLLLL....lining up a shot with a gun that has a 80% chance to 1 shot kill.
never said it was skill
Nice work !       My favorite are the ones mad that you �hard scoped�. 99% time you didn�t.  It�s a coping mechanism for them I think
True
All of ur videos make me wanna vomit...every time
Why though?
That shit was hard as fuck!!
BRUH that final kill cam is blowing my mind.
Why on earth did you film this with a phone lol
Too lazy to go back and find the clip. Easier to upload video from camera roll
didnt even know my mic was on jesus

"Oh your on pc, my xbox astro headsets did this. It was the wire I used to plug the base to the xbox. I got a new one an it stopped. Hope this helps warzone bro"
Take a shot everytime an actor says *insert game title here* saved their life.
youd be a full blown alcoholic
I was told crouching with the RPG helps zero in.  But I find your best shot is when they hover too.   Ah the grind... me too.
"Oh that�s a good thought, I�ll try that out and see if it�s any better"
"I can�t offer any other advice than what�s posted here, but sometimes it helps to take a breather from grinding.  Maybe a game or two might help you hit reset.  I always aimed the direction they were traveling, but can understand when your missing it can be stressful."
Just wait until they stop moving or just move in as close as possible. I am finishing up with the pila now and that�s my last launcher so good luck

"It did the same for me. This has been my favorite CoD since BO2. All my friends I played with in middle/high school came back to gaming and we had fun. I�ve made a lot of friends on this one as well.

I do like the zombies in BO:CW though."
zombies is probably the only good thing about the game.
I wish we could have BOCW Zombies with MW movement & Guns (imagine 200 belt PKMs or 32-shell Magazine AA-12s).
"This was the first COD I�ve owned since MW3. The only reason I came back to COD was because DICE stopped supporting BFV. Had so much fun with MW that I decided to get Cild War. Holy shit what a mistake. I agree, if it ain�t IW I don�t want it. Hopefully the next battlefield game is a banger"
"I�m gonna be devastated if the new WZ map is Cold War engine. Warzone is the only cod I play at this point, just because MW Multi has awful maps, and CW overall is just bad imo"
"Don't worry, it won't be CW Engine. They'd have to migrate the entire system over into CW Engine to do that, and that would be a huge waste of time and money."
I haven�t even considered this possibility. If this comes to happen I�ll be devastated with you
Although what if they do that and revert Warzone back to just MW
"It won't be. That'd imply remaking every gun from MW, and pretty much discarding everything from Warzone as is today"
They won't do that
"Good lord it won�t be in the CW engine. Then you�d have to port over all the MW guns, and consoles couldn�t take the download size. Ffs use your brains and don�t rely on what some goof says Twitter. Activision even said Warzone isn�t going to the CW engine"
"I started playing MW2019 when coldwar released. Mostly a coincidence because i was sick and tired of Apex which had been my main game for years. I was looking for a TDM kind of game and black ops has never been my thing so i jumped into an aging modern warfare. Man am I sad I missed out on the golden months of this game!

My GF bought coldwar for herself in the middle of the season so I gave it a try. Damn. this game is terrible. Even if I forget about my game preferences. It feels like playing a knock off CoD game. Ya know when you get Ray BanG sunglases instead of Ray Ban? Somewhat similar but completely lacking in quality? Well yeah.

So i'm right here with you man. Hopefully Battlefield 6 is good. If not I'll be waiting for something MW2019 style.

I'd also like to add that this sub beeing linked to give feedback is a fkn joke. Never seen a dev on here. They don't give a damn about our opinion and it shows in every single patch."
People justify it by saying it plays like classic CoD. I�ve been playing COD since 2008 and there�s nothing classic about CW.
I also stopped playing cod after cw intergration. Activision is sooo greedy to the point that they make the game unejoyable so you buy their next pile of shit. I've said goodbye to cod some time ago and dont expect to return I'll just stick with titanfall 2 for now.
"I've just accepted I'm not really the target for this game anymore.

I really liked MW2019 when it was starting. I enjoyed the slightly more grounded route it had taken. Then tracers and anime skins and akimbo started pouring in. Then it was basically abandoned for the next CoD cycle."
IW said during the MW announcement that other devs can use the new engine so i was really hoping for a whole new generation of cod games with it but then this shitshow that is CW came out and now i have no hope in Treyarch ever again. Sledgehammer works with IW a lot so it�s definitely possible that they�ll use the new engine.
"As long as people keep buyng their shitgames (looking at you CW), they will keep coming."
Couldn�t agree more. I understand ppl prefer the Cold War style over mw but I stopped playing cod at bo2 when they started going towards outrageous futuristic and Jetpack stuff. I was so excited for mw2019. It brought me back after all these years as well. I also bought cw thinking it would be similar to old bo1 or mw2019 but was so disappointed with it. I played it 2 weeks at launch and haven�t touched it since. It was just such a disappointing step in the wrong direction for me. I really hope the next title improves on what mw2019 did but I think that�s unlikely. Here�s hoping battlefield lights a fire under activisions ass so they actually make a good game again.
"Same. I bought CW purely for the zombies and I had 0 hype for it what so ever and was still let down. So far zombies hasn't come close to how good it is in IW. 

The rumour is SHG are making the next COD which means I am steering way, way away from it. They have never made a COD I have been remotely interested in. I was never a huge fan of 3arch gameplay or balance but they always had the feel of their cod games pretty solid but this year they took over from Sledgehammers failing project and it shows. It feels like a Sledgehammer game and then they tried to ham first animations for running and walking into the game to atleast attempt to compete with MW but they just look crap. 

MW's animation team went above and beyond, say what you want about the gameplay but the animations across the board make MW a technical marvel and it shows just how much care was put into the guns in that game. CW's don't even compete with BO1 from 10 years ago, IDK who 3arch have in their animation department but they need to either be re-trained or let go. Or they just need to find animators who have the passion the MW team has. 

This isn't even talking about other things like graphics, audio, models, movement and everything in between. You may not agree with the gameplay of MW, but the team stood behind their product and made a game they wanted to make and when you do that, the overall product will be alot better."
"Cold War is the worst multiplayer CoD ever, but the zombies is great.  

Sledghammer deserves to keep making games, Advanced Warfare was actually great except for the boost movement- which is a huge factor, I know- and WWII was excellent. 

I blame much of Cold War's terribleness on Activision for taking Sledgehammer out of the lead developer rotation, forcing Treyarch to make this game in a shorter amount of time.  Everyone, including IW, needs Sledgehammer back.

I don't think bloating Warzone with annual content from 3 devs is a good idea, though.  It really shouldn't be linked to the main game other than MW."
"I agree. The last COD I bought was MW2 before MW2019 and I�ve been having a blast this past year playing it. I�ve been getting the same adrenaline I would get from playing MW back then.


Bought CW and it definitely feels like a step back. Havent played it in a couple of weeks."
"Man i feel the exact same way, treyarch games do nothng for me."
"I don�t know why everyone is acting surprised that support for MW stopped and shifted to CW, it�s the same thing that happened when MW dropped, support for BO4 stopped and all the focus was on MW. This happens with every single COD and it will happen with CW as well. Activision makes way too much money to just not release a new title every year."
"I'll probably give Sledgehammer a chance but not Treyarch, fucking hate their games since BO3 and the toxic fanbase"
"I think activision don't realise that a lot of people are fans of the MW game, not the COD series."
I have 0 interest until they take out SBMM
"I have no interest at all for cod anymore. If fact, I'm not even sure why I'm here."
"Cold War is just janky as all hell. From graphics to gameplay. I appreciate all the sensitivity settings it has since those are absolutely crucial in any modern shooter, but it never felt right no matter what. MW is like the gold standard in terms of how it actually feels in terms of playing it on controller. I played CW for free, so I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. Sadly. I don't think the next games will be allowed to be this good. They know what they're doing as they go forward with the games."

"I just want some clear communication on what they�re doing in regards to MW content in both Warzone and MW. Is it over?, why are MW Elements like easter egg unlocks / challenges being removed from WZ?, is there plans to support the future life of MW?, why are new skins taken down a week later?, can we expect any future updates and if so like what?

Just someone coming out officially and talking to a community they know they�re being silent too. Also why so silent after a year of great fun and interaction? Who�s call was it to stop talking here?"
[deleted]
"I bought both games within the span of two weeks at most. MW is the route to a more tactical, more thoughtful series while still maintaining its identity as a fast-paced FPS.  CW is the same old boring game that stereotypes the series as ""selling the same exact game every year."""
"The only map with the most broken, stupid spawns is shipment. I haven�t ever seen a map with spawns broken that badly, you can get player of the game easily by sitting in a corner with an m4 and spawn killing, it�s just stupidly broken"
"It�s definitely not the only one. The spawning algorithm in general is garbage.

Prime example:

https://imgur.com/gallery/GPFxc6w"
"Yeah but i mean, its Shipment, a map desing to be a meatgrinder. The thing is almost every map can be a spawtrapp fest if the enemy team is smart enough to hold down  lanes and your team doesnt move, and sometime it feels like the game its purposely trying to kill you"
"Long story short, the spawn system in this game Is designed for medium-large maps. The system is designed to keep spawns invisible and far away from enemy players. That means no spawn-trapping and aggressive spawn-flipping. That all breaks when there's nowhere to hide the spawns. The absolute smallest a map can realistically be in MW2019 is Shoothouse."
CoD spawns don't work. It's a staple to the franchise. People have been getting what you are describing since CoD multiplayer exists. It fucking blows.
I don�t think it works lol
random I guess
"Shoot house spawns are broken too, especially since most of the players on it will be pushing constantly. There's the traditional spawning behind or in front of the enemies arounds where A or C flags would be, but also spawning in the line of sight of people mounted hardscoping mid. I've had people 2m in front of me while going for longshots, but its normally are the other end (still no cover for them.)"
"it's weird ass and small maps it's sometimes, spawn die, spawn die, spawn die but... when you spawn in the middle of the enemy you can get POTG runs if you're ready and they don't figure it out in like .5 or 1 seconds. LOL"
basically the game waits till you spawn and then spawns the enemy directly behind you
"You can pick your next spawnpoint by simply placing a killstreak down :)

In all seriousness, spawns work as intended, however it's that intent that's broken."
But unfortunately it�s not �technically � released yet
"Yeah I know. But when it does, I don�t have to do a challenge"
Couldn�t have just done a 30 second clip? I had to watch you mount for half the clip and miss your shots over and over?
"Well I�m sorry if you don�t like it, but I was pretty excited that I unlocked it."
"Nice, dude"
"I feel you man same thing happened to me a few times yesterday. I just decided to quit. 

Off topic question: Why doesn't the VTOL attack the helicopters in this game like the harrier did in MW2?"
"Ye, happened to me aswell. They are downgrading the servers for MW since they dont plan on supporting it any more most likely."
Tournaments have been like this since day one. That�s why they are in �Betas�. Nothing to do with server downgrading or anything like that.
Why did you speed it up? Makes the video nauseating
"Maybe post this in r/legaladvice see what they say. 

This is why the only game I play now is Minecraft. All these companies are just greedy pay to win/progress cash printers and it�s ruined gaming for me and many others. Fuck then all."
That�s what I thought too... I did post it there and it was deleted. Apparently they have a rule against naming parties involved.
"I would suggest asking in r/legaladvice where to begin and maybe connecting with the California Bar Association.  I�m sure there�s a few law firms willing to take the case but I couldn�t begin to say how to make it a class action.

Edit: keep us up to date on what�s happening as I�m sure many people would join."
I will definitely keep you up to date. I posted this to legal advice but apparently they have a rule against naming parties involved. I am waiting until Monday and then I will start calling around to find a lawyer... I just am baffled it has come to this over a video game.
"Contact this law firm on Monday: [https://edelson.com/](https://edelson.com/)

They will conduct a free intake and evaluate your claims.  

They are a major player in suing these rotten companies, especially in the video game industry.  

Their representation will most likely be free to you.  If there is a class settlement, they will be awarded a portion of the proceeds.  

It can't hurt to look into it.  Activision has abused its power for too long."
"No it�s been bad for me as well, strictly this game though which is weird. Also have a perfect connection so it�s not the internet"
"They are downgrading the servers since the game is no longer being supported by IW. if you want better servers you gotta play CW or the next cod, until they downgrade those servers aswell ofc"
"1) lucky
2) nasty"
"Oooh the dragunov, you really don�t see it that often"
"its decent, but mostly extremely satisfying when you get a kill. really have to aim for the chest area or higher to get a one shot kill"
Definitely an underrated gem
There's a reason for that
Honestly amazing
yea fr lmao

In mw3 i loved underground where me and my brother used to launch predators to juggies and to call riot shield soldiers
Honestly I�d prefer if handguns could have different profiles when akimbo because it always feels like single handguns have to be made weak just so they aren�t op when akimbo.
"only one that is weaker as akimbo is the burst renetti, all others are just add a second pistol"
It does even though it Shouldent
"Why shouldn't it?

It's technically a shotgun. In COD. And when you're ADS with shotguns in COD your pellet spread tightens -> you get more damage, because all pellets hit the target."
"man, IW really cant balance guns for shit"
That's clearly just you lagging my mans.
"I disagree. This happens to me all the time at this point. PC is not lagging. Internet is not lagging on my side. 

500/500 fiber connection. 10GB from firewall to switch to workstation. So it isn't lag on my side and I experience this crap as well. I get well over 150 frames in larger maps. Almost 180 in smaller maps."

You will not believe what you're seeing after you upgrade to sx.everything will look so much better.
"True, as a person who tried both new-gen consoles, XSX is miles better than the XSS too (MW wise)."
The graphics will look better and yeah should be smoother too. I�m on ps5 and MW looks more sharp. Should look even sharper on series X
Game loads a lot faster too.
Is the rytec actually any good ? I heard the explosive rounds for it are decent
"i used to only like it bc the explosive rounds were funny to me. but since i started trying to get gold, i actually appreciate it more. I'm not a pro, but i think it's decently viable, and i learned to love it for the last barrel unlock and its ridiculous recoil control (which I'm using in this clip). I use the explosive rounds on one of my warzone setups just cuz i think it'd be neat against vehicles but I also don't do warzone often."
"(W/Explosive and thermite rounds) The only sniper that has a infinite one shot anywhere on the body in MP. 

Trade off is ADS speed and slower bullet velocity."
would�ve laughed if you rolled off the building
I was saved before because someone rolled off a ledge haha i got back up and killed him i was just lucky
Tasty....... Finish Him (insert mortal Kombat voice over)
Ohh i might do it haha
That�s not a nice finish.
There's a warzone subreddit you know...
There is?
Clean your fucking room.
"Man,  you just brought me back to my buddy's messy bedroom circa 2006 playing halo 2 in a similar setup. Cherish these moments, they'll be gone before you know it."
Think you need to tidy your room first lmao
Lmaooo all the comments on the room but imagine the jet engines firing up in that room (the ps4s) hahah
New definition of sweats in mw. Shits gonna get warm in there.
Dayum what a mess.
Y�all his room isn�t even that bad. And no my room isn�t dirty but iv seen worse.
Not a good idea to use your carpet as a cum rag just because it can absorb it.
Clean your room before your mother hits the circuit breaker
There is no LAN support in CoD MW 2019
I almost have the smell of your room in my nose.clean for God's sake.
Looks like you need a carpet cleaning party
The room isn't horrid. People talking like they weren't teenagers too. Have fun Bud.
Trap House
Clean your fucking room you animal.
Probably smells terrible
His room isn�t even that messy lmao
His room is useable calm the fuck down guys jesus
"Wow that's a crappy collision break in the wall there. Unlucky.

However using that... thing as the TV stand is making me really nervous, it looks like it's going to fall over!"
"Haha it makes me nervous too but it's what I get for living at my mums while house renovation is going on!
It's an old safe, so nice and sterdy... I hope"
"Shit like this is why I only play this game for fun, and sometimes it's not fun."
"It's how people get air striked indoors, there are always invis holes in buildings.  I wonder if the hole to 2nd floor backlot has been fixed or not, you used to be able to stick c4 on the ceiling and it'll splash both top and bottom bomb site."
2021 and some people are still recording a monitor/tv with a camera/phone ...
"I dont mind a phone recording, but the fact that the HORIZONTAL screen was recorded in VERTICAL from like 3m away infuriates me a lot"
"And vertically at that, smh"
Give it a break
My 10 kill streak in S&D was ended by the bomb exploding in the next room yesterday. I wasn�t even close either.
Your TV stand hanging over the edge is more annoying
Wow you have a steady hand
"I would lose my shit, or laugh, depends how the previous game went"
Nobody else is worried about this monitor falling?
Every day I see something on reddit that reminds me of why I haven�t turned my Xbox on in months. Feels bad man :(
Wow..
I�m confused how you were prepared to record this with this weird set up ?
"I saved the clip on PS4, went back into capture gallery. It's the only way I know how haha"
That�s bullcrap
No fucking wonder i alwa6s die behind c9ver from explosives. GG IW
r/JustCODThings
im more curious about whether that is Al Capone's safe he's resting the monitor on.
I think it's a bug
"�game?�

�game broke�

�understandable have a great day�"
What is your monitor attached to? Is that a trash can with the lid attached to the tv?
"It's balanced on a safe, I like the irony of it all"
I�m so sorry
"Rank resets every season I believe, as for weapons I�m pretty sure anything you unlock should stay unlocked."
Yes I've just gone deeper into my create-a-class and all my weapons are unlocked. Was just confused about the rank system. Thanks!
"Agree on tactical sprint, disagree with slide cancel"
Why disagree on the slide cancel? :)
"I think they should default make the tactical sprint longer and remove the ability to slide cancel. Its not a difficult thing to do but I think it does adversely advantage those who do it compared to those who don't. I think the best fix would be just increasing the tactical sprint time, maybe even 3 times longer normal and doubletime being twice that but keep a cooldown."
"It�s not difficult to do, and it�s advantageous to do ... so why not do it? That�s where I get confused because you should be doing it, and it�s easy so why not? Slide cancelling is for a lack of a better word �higher level� movement where people can learn and master it and get better. Just increasing the skill gap, wouldn�t that be a good thing?

Edit: same as camera� ing or jumpshotting or airstrafing around the corner"
"I love it, especially your point about sprinting vs jogging. I just wish there was an option to automatically tac sprint in place of sprinting, not in place of walking. Don't want to double press every time, but also want to be able to walk lol"
There's an auto tac Sprint option
Disagree with tactics sprinting. Really hate the mechanic
"So there is no de facto way to prove it as a player. Even if your spectate your would really be able to know for sure. They could have a really good mic, or the game could be favoring them a bit if the bought stuff, even just plain luck.

But some things to watch out for that tend to be clear signs:

1. Tracking targets through walls: on the kill cam,if they are staring at a wall and perfectly tracking you until you can be hit consistently. Tends to be obvious.

2. They don�t play aggressively: The will likely always be keeping something between you and them by some magnitude. Since they can see where you are, there is no need to rush or be aggressive, as it removes their advantage.

3. The use weapons that aren�t suited to the job:
Using a Sniper rifle in a enclosed, indoor space with tight corners is suicide. Since the ADS, and fire rate is suicidal...unless you know where people are ahead of time.

4. You never kill them head on:
Note the ways they get killed. Most cases those people will always win head on engagements, but wall hacks are line of sight. If you only manage to kill them from behind or the side, but never head to head...kinda sus.

5. They use weapons that attract attention:
Getting shot through a wall with a Sniper rifle, LMG, or the As Val? No one would bat an eye since the normally excell at penetration. But note the attachments. Note how the builds don�t make a lot of sense for the play style.

6.  Follow behind a teammate at about 6-12 feet, and slightly off to one side.  But when going into buildings let the Freind go first When the friendly gets killed, note the kill came. If they track the both of you, and behave as if their waiting for you. That�s another tell.

The games footsteps system downs establish multiple feet. In three people run together, you gay one source. Thus the only way they could know there was a second person is by cheating."
"very last point is horribly wrong, you can easily tell if it's multiple people just by footsteps.

also, several points would even apply to me, like not always being aggressive, winning head on fights just about every time, wallbanging with guns not meant for it, etc. But that's no indication of any cheats"
"Act like you're gonna peak a corner but don't actually show yourself. If he prefires, he can see you through the wall"
"If they are better than you, it�s wall hacks 100%"
"Watch killcams. Do they check corners well consistently, or do they only look where players happen to be lurking? Are you able to kill the player by hiding in an off angle or does that never seem to fly? 

IMO, that's the best way to figure out if someone is walling for sure. Most cheaters (even ""good"" ones) don't check corners properly because they know beforehand whether or not an enemy is present."
Hax.exe
I have a question ? Is there a hard to kill cheat  or one shoot kill ? As I�ve shot people in the head some time multiple time for them not to die to be shot once to be killed
Shooting through walls
Ahh my favourite cod mission ever
Pretty sure Price mentions him in the campaign. Or maybe one of the spec ops cutscenes. But he gets name dropped.
"He does mention him in the ending cutscene. In the original MW timeline, he later becomes a general or some other high-ranking officer, so that might be what happened to him in this timeline."
"I know in cod 4 his leg got ruffed up but I would assume he made some sort of recovery and then got old and became baseplate in mw3 however, in the new timeline I think he could have some way of returning :)"
Better yet what about my boy yuri
"We aren�t even able to get soap yet, I doubt we will see Macmillan unless the next 2020 mw is a task force 141 game and there are new flashback moments. Then we might get him as a cool nifty legacy throwback for multiplayer and warzone."
I don't know how that man survived to a helo in his legs. Aldo in that mission if the helo hitted you you died
I personally love the realistic factor of MW and just how much effort was put into the game. There are so many details no matter where you look. The gun-play is outstanding. Some of the best I've seen in a game. MW is definitely in my top 3 CODs and this is coming from someone who has been hating the past CODS up till now. MW took 2 steps forward in terms of quality and CW took 5 steps back. The gunplay is basic and not very fun. The maps are horrendous (including it's terrible spawn system) and it's very unimaginative. It's just very bland in all aspects. Zombies is quite fun but it's nowhere near as fun as the old zombies. CW zombies it's extremely easy where as the old zombies was challenging yet do-able. it's definitely good if you're just trying to kill time.
Mw
"I enjoyed Cold War but, hands down, MW is the better game."
"Modern warfare is more next gen than CW, infinity ward brought back that hype with MW in the COD community that we had all them years back with the other classic cods, if you�re looking for quality get MW. The movements and flow of the game are perfect for aggressive players, the sniping is so satisfying and when you get them headshots it feels amazing. Obviously there are campers with shotguns here and there but that�s expected in every cod game. The maps are all extremely different and amazing in their own ways so you will never get bored, (except for a few but that�s based on your own preference.) the guns just feel way better and the game is overall a lot smoother than CW"
"I personally own both games, and I�ll tell you I prefer MW. It�s my opinion, probably because it�s my first cod  that I owned (I played before but it was on someone else�s console) and I loved this game.

If you want an Arcady, a little bit slower paced shooter game, go with Cold War. Now if you want a realistic, fast paced chaotic modern military shooter, go with mw. I like mw�s graphics better and think that the movement is smoother (slide cancelling, tactical sprint) and I just like that fast pacing and chaos more. 

But it�s still only my opinion, you can buy cw if you want, but i personally prefer modern warfare.

And since you�re asking on both subs I think you�ll get cw is better in cw sub and mw is better here. But anyways, that�s my opinion. Hope it helps.

Btw I said the game is fast paced, and that applies to the majority of games. Some games can be reeeeally campy and slow, so beware."
"They put time and effort into Modern Warfare and it was the best cod since BO2.  The graphics were great, the gameplay was smooth, the mastery skins were cool, the realism was a nice touch.  It just seems like everything about cold war is a down grade from Modern Warfare"
"I don�t know where you heard Cold War wasn�t doing too good with sales, other than the biased angsty kids on reddit who get off on hating it - but Cold War has sold more units in a few months than Modern Warfare ever did in over a year. 

In fact, it literally broke a record. It�s one of the top 20 most sold US games of all time. 

Here�s a tweet from the Executive Director of the NPD talking about it. They�ve been tracking game sales since the 1990s.

If you like to play aggressively you�ll want to play Cold War. Modern warfare gameplay is very slow and clunky. It was meant to be more realistic and tactical. Cold War has better mobility/agility. It�s a night and day difference. 

Now people on this sub are going to tell you otherwise because they�re extremely biased. But I�m somewhat of an anomaly here, in that while I thoroughly enjoy Modern Warfare and have played it since launch - I�m not going to make shit up and dump on Cold War because it�s the newer game. 

Neither games will have population issues due to them both being rather popular and crossplay being a thing. Good luck in your decision."
"How similar to BO1 does Cold War feel? I heard the maps were bad, thoughts?"
"There's literally no legitimate way for Cold war to have sold over 30 million units already in 4 months, when their launch sales really lacked.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thegamer.com/black-ops-cold-war-sales-were-a-lot-slower-than-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/amp/

Only word from Activision is that the sales have picked up after warzone integration, but its impossible for them to be the best selling call of duty. They would've most certainly said something about it as well. I have no hate towards Cold war, but you are spewing bullshit and being extremely condescending while doing so."
Easily Cold War
"> My playstyle is definitely super aggro

BOCW all the way my friend. MW is a slow camp fest, and the maps only support that further."
"MW Is better...
I very enjoy game everyday"
"Corrupted data on that specific map, reinstall all multiplayer packs."
"So I went and did this, and got the same error tonight.  This time, mid-match."
You been watching the hub on your console bro?
What do you mean?
I was hoping these 7 surgical would get a like lol
"Yes. I had both coalition and alliance operators set to random and when I tried to change them to a specific one, they both stayed showing as random but with Park and Vargas names under them. Took about an hour or so before they changed back to normal."
Did you trigger anything for them to return to normal?
Was since season 1
What the Kentucky fried fuck
Have the same problem
The golden gimp
That message pops up but you still get the tiers.
"I'm getting them, but the items are not appearing in my inventory."
"i think you can claim them only in cold war, i had this issue when i was playing in the free week"
"They're supposed to be claimable in warzone too though,  even if you don't own black ops."
"this feels like dark souls 1 PvP, just baiting for backstabs"
Literally nothing special about this..
T-bag wasn't necessary.
"So anyway, I started blasting."
What�s the song
"Aaron Smith- Dancin, it�s a remix so your best bet is to search KRONO remix"
Renetti spaghetti
Nice play but bro fix your encoder
sorry i have a shitty laptop
Pistolero
"I love quickscoping and trick shotting people on occasion it�s just fun. But I won�t get pissed if someone uses other weapons, it�s good to have a bunch of different play styles in every game"
Yes real sniping better but i dont hate qs
You're only garbage if you're camping
Know what i never see or hear about? The corner camping sniper. Its fun getting called a female genital for camping with a shotgun until they see the killcam and realize it was a sniper... Nothing but crickets afterwards lol
"All these clown they think they�re doing sum special, snipers are as broken as shotgun you don�t even need to see the guy just aim at a name tag and 9/10 you getting the kill"
"I only play HC ffa, no quickscopers there because it's HC and all lol"
"If you hate quick scoping you�re gonna hate playing this game overall. Almost every lobby has someone QS�ing with a Kar or SPR. 

Your other option is getting rundown by people with the AS VAL so pick your poison.

Edit: grammar"
black ops 2 4 life. I hope they reduce scope in time by 400% ez clap
"We been quick scoping since cod4 lol nothing new, so you either adapt or don�t play"

"what are your switches, sounds crisp aha"
Cherry Mx blues haha
I thought that was the symbol for deployable cover?
It's field upgrade pro (two field upgrades you can select).
That would be nice for the people who missed out. Unfortunately Activision is trying pretty much everything they can to push people away from Modern Warfare and into Cold War.
"For example, CW ""buy me please"" tab at MW it�s bigger than the other ones.   
I don�t know on consoles, but on PC, when you open the game, the mouse is centered into the screen making this tab active.   
So you always see CW ""buy me please"" tab everytime you launch the game."
Your best chance is the release a vault pack for those seasons. But they won�t be allowing you to grind them again. The vault packs are also pricey as well.
"They're pricey because of Captain *Price* heheh.




Maybe not..."
"I�m in a similar boat, I only got to mw after a long console gaming hiatus to finish uni when the ps5 came out. I was happy I snagged one and mw has felt like the cod I missed so it felt like slipping back into things proper. But when I came back it was just starting season 1 of Cold War so I missed all mw season content. Heck even if not a battlepass reset I would pay for most of the content. I�m sure many would."
Have you seen the pricing tho? They've only released S1 battle pass as bundles but the total for them is 18000CP
"They're not doing a battle pass reset because they've been releasing vault packs with pervious season content in them. If you want season 1-2-3-etc operators, skins, blueprints, then you need to pay a premium for it. Thats the way Activision sees it anyway. Why let you just earn the stuff when they can nickel and dime you the entire way."
"They're too greedy, and they've already done the S1 vaulted bundles so they'll use that as an excuse (although they dont answer to anyone)"
"Firstly, you are crazy since this would never happen.
Secondly, price is gone and that�s a good thing,he�s a timed exclusive.
Thirdly, you�re best chance is a vault pack which might only be for season 1 since no other seasons have been mentioned."
All the noobs went to Cold War so now you're stuck with all the sweaty try-hards in the  SBMM pool
When the game released everyone played for the hype and new experience. Now that we over a year in it�s mainly just the cod fan base. So mostly the better players.  I�d imagine people getting their ass kicked for a year would prob quit if they don�t have the drive to wanna be better.
Thanks for the reply.
"could be the server downgrade, it has affected hit detection quite a bit"
What�s the bug?
Playing with nvgs off created some crazy experiences with explosions and gunfights in the dark even though you couldn�t see shit lol
"I have found taking the goggles off and sitting in the dark with a good view of a well lit objective to be a cheesy, yet effective method."
I didn�t even realize Gun Runner was based off the same compound from the first campaign�s mission til I replayed the campaign a second time.
"There's quite a lot of that in the campaign 

Rammaza in the first mission where you meet Farah, Euphrates Bridge when you play as Farah escaping the compound, St Petersburg has similar streets to St Petrograd. And Picadilly of course is Picadilly lol"
How long does it take for a vid to get uploaded?
"Depends on your internet speed, but when it gets published, who fucking knows, I just posted [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/m4nyiz/when_you_think_youve_probably_gotten_the_play_of/) and it went through instantly, usually it takes me like 15 hours though."
Ah ok bro :) and already did bro + followed
I was waiting for the nuke to fall.
"On this map, the nuke does fall in the same area I was looking"
Amazing game especially on the PS5
How do I inspect weapons?
"Depends what platform, the default on PC is the I key (I for Inspect), on Xbox you hold left on the D-pad and I�m assuming PlayStation is the same as Xbox"
Love the transitions bro
"Thanks, had to get it frame perfect, you know?"
That transition though.
nice aimbot lol
"Damn dude, you went hard on these motherfuckers, great clutch, bruh."
Hardscope but dope
Lol I know usually I tend to go for quickscopes in Cold War but in MW it is definitely harder to pull them off
Your movement is low key wack but it works clearly so nothing wrong with it
I think it might be SBMM having issues getting enough people to fill lobbies so it has to get people who live further away (so higher pings) and/or people in a higher or lower skill level than normal.
I'm afraid you're right.  That's bad news.  I was hoping we could keep a good player base a little longer than this.
"I�m convinced SBMM is fucked and Activision doesn�t care to fix it. I want it, but it has to work properly."
"I'm kind of agnostic when it comes to having or not, but if you decided to use it, it better fucking work."
I run into the same players in free for all very often. Game could be dying...
"I've been thinking the same there is something breaking every update it seems. The playlists are getting worse and worse. Match making is all over the place, quick scoping seems to every where, shipment never appears in core, you can lobby surf all night and seem to just get tank factory, or the oil rig, both in my opinion the worse maps of all. It seems they are trying to drive users off MW to cold war as cold war has done so poorly."
"Ok?

Also, wrong subreddit, you should be posting to /r/CODwarzone"
"Shut up, bitch"
"Got the same issue, it was recently added to the list of known issues (took a month at least)  
[https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/known-issues-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare](https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/known-issues-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare)  
Hopefully they will fix it for a coming update.

Personally, the only ""temporary"" fix I found was to do LT while being in the lobby after each game on player 2 and to go to Battle Pass section, as the issue is related to exp points and Battle Pass exp points not being added to this player. This allows Player 2 to unlock his exp points and to be able to play few games in a row.  
It's not working 100% of the time, but at least it allows to play few games, before needing to restart the Xbox.

Can't wait for this to be fixed, if you want to report the bug and help showing them it's not only a few people having this issue, report it here : [https://www.cvent.com/d/yyqfvy](https://www.cvent.com/d/yyqfvy)"
Thanks!
They took the new guns out of warzone I think
Not removed it just harder to find now
"Nah they�re just harder to find

I found the serac cx9 in plunder yesterday"
"People need to stop acting like IW has control over when they can release stuff, it�s very clear IW have finished the content and want to release it but Activision are holding it back so that they can force people to buy and play Cold War."
"So we keep coming back I guess, they know MW is still active but if they give it all of it away the player base might get bored and I know for a fact that people ain�t playing Cold War"
cold war fanboys will taste this too in november when cod 2021 releases
Does cold war actually have fanboys? Or is it just treyarch fanboys lying to themselves that they like a terrible game?
First time?
I dont get why the devs keep quiet about it... just say when they will expect it to drop or say its not coming. But keeping quiet is just poor communication.
"There�s only two possible explanations here. 

1.	Raven really is that incompetent. 
2.	They really are moving Warzone to a standalone application using the Cold War engine and are spending all this time porting the existing assets. 

I know people on this sub will respond to #2 with �Nuhh uhh man, Cold War engine sucks. It�s gonna kill the game. Mw good, CW bad.�

But they also say the same thing about SBMM and a whole host of other things that Activision couldn�t give a shit about. They�re gonna do their own thing regardless of what a subreddit or twitter thinks. They always have."
I can�t wait until they move warzone to the Cold War engine. That will completely blow up in their faces lmao
They are not doing 2 for sure... It would be a massive amount of work for something that they know that would blow up in their faces.
"They would never do 2 in a million years. Have you played Cold War?? Have you played Fireteam Dirty Bomb and seen how awful the engine is for modes like that? 

That would never ever ever happen and would kill the game overnight"
"It is not the devs fault but Activision who, I think, will try people to get Cold War rather than MW and so killed the game since the fusion with season one of Cold War. This also makes sense from the perspective of Activision who are just a bunch of money blind people who of course want that Cold war to get all the attention until the next COD. The new COD will then be the final nail in the coffin making the franchise irrelevant while the coffin is carried by Battlefield 6."
"Soap will come with the end of Verdansk whenever that is, he�s mentioned in the cinematic ending that links to the nuke."
Here have soap to play in verdan... and it�s gone
"Don�t connect it through blizzard, log in with the same Activision account"
Do I have to install it again
"�How dare people inconvenience me, the protagonist of reality�"
this has nothing to do with reality or anything like that. this post can not be argued against it's a fact if no one moves in a game that is designed from the floor up to be a run and gun shooter then there's no game play idk how you and other people do not see that fact. campers rely on people to play the game for what it's supposed to be played like.face it if everyone camps in every game then there's no game play... call of duty ghosts proved that fact to us
"heartbeat sensor, spotter grenades, that perk you can hack tripmines with, stuns/flashes

just a few tools you can use to take down campers if you hate them that much"
it's not about taking them down dude that's easy I do it all the time... the problem with camping is it's fundamentally broken at such a level it will actually ruin the franchise if everyone did it that's what I'm getting at. if more people camp less people want to play then the games just going to be full of campers and it will be dead. call of duty can't afford any more cod ghosts incidents I have been playing this game for 10 years and it's actually kinda sad to see the game in the state that it is with sbmm and camping etc new cod heads don't understand how call of duty should be and used to be back in the day if you camped you got bullied both In game and verbally now everyone camps and if you play the game without dead silence your fucked that's not how it should be ... players make the meta not the developers
So what is ur grand solution to �camping�?
"I currently play call of duty wwII I like the map Sainte marie du mont lots of buildings for campers to hide in lots of Windows for me to jump out of... so if there's a camper there I'll constantly be running in and around the same building going up the stairs killing the camper jumping out of the window ""onto mid streets"" where everyone is try grab a kill run back in and by that time the camper is back trying to set up camp then I rinse and repeat that way no one can camp they will go negative and rage quit the match people only camp because there bad at the game and want an easy way to ""git good"" but there not getting good because there not moving"
you get a timer attached and if you sit in the same shameless corner for half a minute you just explode and get kicked from the server :~)
"go and play rainbow six siege. there is no alternative to camping. apart from basically what I call patrolling which is still camping. basically you just try and lock down 1 area ""by still moving around"" go to a place a camper would be and run and gun around that area specifically your still moving people will still see you to kill you but you can still have the safety of a house... you absolutely have to move in call of duty for the game to be playable so ""patrolling"" is the better thing over camping. you can't camp in call of duty ""even though you can"" you definitely shouldn't because it's actually game breaking if you want to experience what mean by 6v6 and everyone camping just go into a solo match offline with no one else in it sit in a house and that's it. that's the call of duty experience if everyone camps"
"Thats what all my lobbies were like last night.

I'm literally the only one moving. I'm hearing no footsteps but my own and going long periods hearing no gunfire.

I ended up just quitting, I can't play when its like that, its so boring."
exactly it's not how call of duty can be played you can't play the game like that it's actually breaking the game and I don't mean like stim glitch I mean like the game is actually dead if people don't move your just running round on a map you know there's people there but the map is empty
"You really thought you were onto something with this one, huh?"
I actually am though and it's the truth... why do you think there's time limit game plays in 6v6 tdm at 75 and 100 kill limits? it's because there's not enough kills happening because people camp. ergo less people play the game because people camp and no one wants to play Vs campers so they go and play different games warzone battlefield old cod games overwatch apex etc. less people in the game means less interest in call of duty as a franchise I really don't know how people don't see that camping is fundamentally broken and call of duty as a franchise relys on people to move in the game are you just stupid or something? like seriously have you tried not moving for 10 minutes in call of duty at a time it's very boring you might aswell not be playing the game. if everyone in match was to camp in there spot how in the actual fuck is anyone going to win the match or get any kills? seriously answer me this question if nobody moves in a first person shooter that relies on people to move for kills how is the game even playable? NO ONE MOVES NO ONE GETS KILLS PEOPLE SIT IN THE CORNER FOR 10 MINUTES NOT EVEN DOING ANYTHING OR PALYING THE GAME BECAUSE THERE NOT GETTING KILLS the whole god damn point of call of duty is to run and gun do me a favour go into a solo match just you no bots and imagine there's 11 other people camping in there spot and your a camper go find your spot and wait for a kill you won't get any because no one is moving dumb ass
"yes, it has been happening a few times, sometimes one of us gets booted, sometimes it doesnt even go through the ""loading level"" part"
Okay atleast im not* alone* in this. It just kicked my friend but left me..... Then let him join round 5 of the finals...... Fml.....
"Yes. First game i disconnected, second game my teammate. gave up on it"
Yup tournament is kinda unplayable...
"Thats how every tournament goes for me, and matchmaking gives u one per fucking hour,"
I just played a few with no problems.
Your so lucky its been super frustrating having to wait another 5 min after winning to get to finals/semi finals....
Riot shield and Val. Yikes.
Was getting Damascus for it
Its because you have no incentive to do good. You've completed the main task you've put upon yourself. That's how I felt getting Diamond camo in BO2. I still played but the drive wasn't there anymore
"When I got my Damascus I felt the same, but everytime they put a new gun I used to get that feeling back"
100% weapon master calling card
"When I got Damascus I stopped playing for about 7 months. Couldn�t get back into it.

Recently I bought BOCW and thought it played bad and got back into MW2019. Having so much fun again!"
"They do hardware bans from what I've read but cheaters can bypass them.

They do need some sort of anti-cheat software such as Battleye but Activision is just too cheap to pay for it."
"So they can shove battlepasses and overpriced skin packs down our throats, but they don't wanna buy an anti cheat that a buggy dinosaur survival game uses?

This is some Mr. Krabs level cheapness here."
Yea apparently people can spoof ids for hardware (people go through insane things to cheat). WTF
You hate to see it
"I mean seriously, who still uses a shield"
"725 users. Trust me, they still exist"
Grinders.
"If in doubt, set it on fire."
WHAT
Same issue...33% of my games. Huge issue obviously.
"It's the game, your Xbox is fine"
"This problem is EXTREMELY frustrating. It legit just happened to my buddy and I both who are on the series X one after another in circle 5 with 16 people left . . . What.The.Fuck.   


What's even more frustrating is the fact that there's been no official statement on it by anyone for MONTHS since the consoles release. Microsoft/Xbox or Activision. Like fix your fucking shit man."
"33% of my games as well. MW skin, ffar, kar"
I play with a few people (myself included) who have the Xbox series x. We always get booted more often than the others. At least 5 to 1. So I think it�s a Warzone problem that affects the new Xbox more for some reason
This game is such trash
Been kicked 4 times just today on my series x.
Must be a Modern Warfare issue as I have an Xbox Series X also and have no problems.
Just because yours doesn't do it doesn't mean nobody else can't have the problem. Five times in three days for me.
Thank you
"I usually play with a pc guy, a xbox one guy, and then me and another guy have series x...both if us with the series x get the error more than any if our friends."
"I read somewhere that the community thinks it�s related to Cold War weapons and skins. I get booted all the time, even after I deleted and reinstalled both WZ and CW. 3rd game after I reinstalled, I got booted. Now.. I maybe crazy but I swear most of the time it�s when I�m using a ffar, LC10, and Mac 10. I stopped using them yesterday and didn�t have a crash for a few hours. I won�t even pick those guns up anymore. Not 100% sure that�s the problem but it seemed to have helped. I�ll play tonight and see if it kicks me with that same strategy."
"Wish that were true. It's happened to me while spectating, using only MW weapons and operator. I've tried everything and nothing fixes the error. Happens at least twice a night."
"This is 100% untrue and people need to stop spreading wrong information. I understand people are trying to be helpful, but this it�s Cold War stuff isn�t true. Today alone, played 4 games of warzone, got the error twice and I have zero Cold War stuff on my loadouts. Not using any skins, no operators emblems weapons, nothing. Both times I dropped I was using my 100% MW loadouts. It�s infuriating and honestly I think I�m done with the game until they fix it, it�s always midway to the end of the match so all the time is lost progress, and there is no help from anyone at raven or IW."
I'm also having the same issue. Was running fine until they added the graphics update.
"I wonder if it�s related to the graphics pack downloads for the next gen consoles. 

I stopped using my coldwar operator and went with Velken. Still got booted. I am using old school Kruger and so far so good (about two days without kicks). Hope it gets resolved soon."
"Its not, i only use modern warfare stuff and still get kicked mid game."
For the ass clowns on Microsoft's D mine has done it 5 times in 3 days across two games. There is some minor Hardware or software glitch somewhere.
"I was getting kicked every 3rd game on my series x, switched to my old machine,  no issues. Someone please update this when it is fixed!"
Seriously. Keep getting kicked consistently every night. Super frustrating Xbox series x
This problem started a month ago with me. Seems to be getting worse by the day. They better fix this soon or I might be done with the game.
yeah and then they give me 3v3 gunfight again no thanks
Totally agree. Gunfight is as bad as S&D for sweats. I only play those modes when challenges require them but boy are those some toxic lobbies/games.
It resets the tac sprint ability. Pretty much lets you run faster
But does it work if you slide cancel? Is it worth it to waste a stim in case I do that?
"Usually run restock and amped. Off spawn sprint with a knife/kali sticks and once you slow down stim to tac sprint again (do it one more time with second stim if needed). This is the quickest way to get to a spot and prehold an angle before the enemy gets there. Mainly used in search. If you start doing this, like someone said above, knowing when to switch back to your primary is key so you dont get melted since youre locked in the animation and cant switch."
It's hilarious watching kids do that to cover more ground and get melted almost instantly after banging the stim lmao
I like seeing the animation.
i used to stim a lot in snd but i found myself genuinely needing the second stim to keep momentum on the rush so i just slide cancel and i see no difference in the speed that i get to the bomb
Habit kid
No.
"If you buy a US code, it can only be used on a US account."

"No iw should just focus on mw2. The only thing this game *needs* is for season 7 to drop. Mw fans on social media need to realize that there's more to this game than shoot the ship, we have more than enough content."
"Except maybe carving out black ops assets, re-upscaling the graphics and audio to what it was and an anti-cheat."
"why not just add a new campaign and 6 more seasons instead of a 'new' game that has to be integrated to warzone anyway? add FOV sliders, new maps, etc."
"There're different teams working on games. 1 team can work on support, while other teams can work on MW2"
"I love MW but I think a sequel would be better. It�s a chance for a fresh set of maps, new and returning, and hopefully they�ll be better. There�s also the possibility of weapons actually being balanced and encouraging variety instead of such a rigid meta. Also, having reset SBMM is nice."
Yes bro that would be sick. That�s kind of what they�re doing with Warzone so maybe warzone will end up being like that
"or just release more seasons, with the unreleased maps or older maps all in one package. why split the userbase *again* when we could just have a bigger and deeper game?"
"If they wont balance guns for this game, what makes you think they will do it for the next one? The next IW game will be more or less the same. Another 60�, another cod."
Now if they can just unbreak the split screen.

yeah they seem to focus more on banning people who�ve done literally nothing than banning people who actually ruin the game for others
"Very annoying and since this sub leeches anything season 7 related it blows up like a atom bomb here 

They do it to get views hell gaming Revolution said shit was gonna drop on the 11th and this sub was like 


�Why no stuff :(� 


It�s annoying and dumb they only do it for views"
I was one of the people that fell for the March 11th date. I�m saddened by the lack of CX-9.
"""Why the hell are **clickbaiters** still milking season 7 every two weeks like it�s still happening?""

Asked and answered"
"I mean, aside from the fact you're still on the topic of season 7 means you're doing the same thing, but let's put that aside.

The reason people do it is cause they want more updates for this game, and I guess they're hoping a developer sees the demand for it? I don't know, but this has been the first cod that has had some sort of cross progression, so it gives the impression that MW isn't being abandoned, even though it is, and people don't want it to be.

Personally I never believed any of the stuff about season 7, cause I know how CoD games roll. It's really fucking sad though that CoD is still doing yearly games. It could really benefit from releasing games every 2 or 3 years, having more time to work on them, and giving the current game more content. It just makes for a better quality product."
"Yearly cod games won�t go away until Activision realises that they could just, get all their cod devs to make 1 COD Game and support it with updates for a solid 5 years.

It�s what I hope to see 1 day a Call Of Duty game that is supported for a solid 5-8 years with constant new content updates. I�m sure Activision will eventually realise that they can make far more money on micro transactions if people know the game won�t be dumped after a year or 2."
Cod YouTubers in a nutshell:
"Random comment guys, has any one else found the wall Glitch in C.O.D Zombies? My mate n I have been spinning out for the last half hour, when inside the Castle on Outbreak Golover you can jump into the walls at the Archways. When inside you can see the whole floor layout and every Player and Zombie at the Castle.... pretty cool Glitch"
There's spots like that in a few different buildings in outbreak
"Uh, because they�re getting clicks."
"Because people fall for it, obviously"
"I find this whole sub annoying. Want to leave but at the same time, don�t wanna miss the 1 post per week that is actually useful."
"It�s actually annoying. Modern Warfare is over unfortunately. They released the weapons,bundles and maps and that�s most likely it for the game"
I mean if you go into a survival local game you can technically try out the new guns for awhile even if season 7 doesnt drop for another year i personally have been using the new raal mg lmg gun non stop.when im bored and wanna show a juggernaut what bullets feel like.
"I�ve tried to unlock them in survival on PS4 about an hour ago, the challenges don�t track for the hidden guns :("
Just cause there�s new guns doesn�t mean a season 7 is coming. We will never get a season 7. We will get the guns though.
Because children and idiots keep clicking on them.
"yeah, me."
Gotta hate but can't blame  those who be on defense yet still running away in those situations. ggs
the way you looked at those stacked claymores lmao
Your gpu is shitting out
"They should test a couple other games, but that is what this looks like"
Same with me
Effectively the Battlepass for MW 2019 is over in order to concentrate on CW. But they don't advise you of this when you purchase the Battlepass.
So i can�t buy the battle pass? Or do i have to buy CW to do it?
"You can play MW  but the only Battlepass currently available is on Cold War meaning anything you earn on there is available, on MW you are wasting your money."
Ffs..
I never spend money on that shit. I bought like the season 3 battle pass and ever since then I just save up the cod points I earn from the battle pass so I can buy the next one
"It�s the universe telling you that you don�t need more trash in your life. Battle pass will give you items you can use in WZ and BOCW. Pretty sure do tokens don�t work in MWMP, not does the BP 10% permanent buff."

And this is why 1. You run High Alert and 2. Consoles need a wider FoV
Does high alert only alert you if someone is scoped down on you or no?
Or even just a surround sound headset. Heck even without it you should have heard the double footsteps.
The dude that you were following his game sense is terrible
In his defense.. op had activated dead silence
"It�s probably bc of the trash FOV in MW for consoles, I wish I could have 120 like in CW"
It was probably me
Ngl. I would�ve died if he had killed you
Lots of death in such a small sentence ):
"If I posted a clip like this, then yes, he would've killed me."
Ewww is that motion blur?
This looks so smooth compared to my pc. Is this Xbox?
This is PS4. He just has motion blur on
What is your video card?
Glory isn�t given isn�t too rare it was just a cdl watch time reward. Rarest calling card is the mastery calling card. Probably not even 100 people have it legit. Somewhere close to that number.
I�ve just never seen someone use it? Have you?
Garbage

you need spec ops 1 which only is available to you when you buy the full game just like campaign
"Found this kid while playing, and he definitely wasn't playing like someone who should be that level since the reset that happened not long ago. Pulled up his stats on the left and mine on the right....some huge bug or some sort of hacking? I have damascus for reference, but my playtime is larger than it should since I'll leave it on in the background sometimes when I'm eating etc. since I have the background music turned off."
"If only there wasn't that long-ish delay before you got out of the garage and found the fifth kill. And the way you kept it going rather than just losing it after the first spree too... 

You filthy hackerman *tgdGoodGod*"

I dont think dudes Cheating and I've called out few cheaters his flicks are solid an if he is then its a very smooth toggle aimbot with the tiniest aimbot lock spot . If you think this guys flicks are anything go watch any Nate Gibson video on youtube his shit sus AF.
"no offense.
i know the whole thing looks sus, but it�s just that one flick at 00:13. that�s the one that just looks like he�s cheating."
Hard to watch... I knew about ten seconds in that this guy was cheating.
But he's not. He's just insane
Hit me with your rhythm flicks
Flick me fast and flick me quick
"youre so blatant buddy, stop cheating on here, youre the reason this game is so terrible to play against with people like you..."
"It's hilarious how absolutely sure you are that he's cheating, when there is literally 0 evidence other than him aiming at people"
"Some of you people don�t know what mice are, but with them, you can do things like this, if you get good enough. You learn something new everyday. If you�d like to begin your journey to become good at the game, use code TGD13 at checkout when buying eAdvantage to get a USB with his aimbot on it. Allah bless you on your path to skill"
"yeah right, really terrible to waste such a good game with cheaters as blatant as him"
imagine cheating and it being so goddamn blatant omfg
I found the 49 year old dad that plays tactically on controller and has over half a second of reaction time.
"If he�s cheating then why has his account not been banned after 10 years of gameplay like this lmao, stay mad you fucking bot"
was about to express a lot of doubt and then noticed it was you james
Pog
"It really does come to something when not only are these streamers cheating, but they aren�t even trying to hide it. Activision ban him please."
Activision knows he's not cheating
Unreal flicks
Aim is insane
JESUS you're fucking insane
"the one thing that really is just insanely sus (apart from the whole thing no offense) is the backwards flick on 00:13.
you didn�t see him, and ain�t no way you heard him that far away. you still kept shooting when you flicked an then stopped as if you hadn�t expected that flick."
"It doesn't seem that sus, you can see him take time to reposition his aim after he turned right? I mean he just cleared everybody infront of him, makes sense to me that he turns around to see if he needs to cover his ass (which he did). He quickly notices the guy at the garage and then mows him down. He didnt even flick straight to him."
At 0:07 you can see the high alert indicator to his left and also hear shots coming from the direction he eventually flicks to at 00:13.
lol this guy thinks hes goodd using a cronus that allows him to aim lock onto people. Nice try m8 but this aint legit
"Judging by your past comments you're actually serious. Cronus? LMAO you silly goose

https://youtu.be/3NPhC8JuJ90
https://youtu.be/ob5YffPwTzQ
https://youtu.be/t47vhT076zc

Pay special attention to the four year old video and his desk setup."
Aight I saw you miss once I think your not cheating
I just unlocked platinum SMGs and I didn�t even have to do the striker 45 bc of a glitch
"Striker is a dlc weapon, you dont have to do those for plat"
"I accidentally did the crossbow because I didn�t realize you didn�t have to do every weapon in the class, just the base ones that the game originally starts with"
You don't have to do striker bc it came later
Well done!!!!!!
"I hope so, having the grounded characters they have in MW is great, the voice acting for all of them (excluding domino and morte) was fantastic and all the minor personallity quirks (like bale telling the enemy to try harder when they miss a cruise missile) has made them all such good characters compared to treyarchs bland casts and the blank slates we've had in the past

MW has real personality, and I really hope it holds onto that in MW21/22 whenever we get it."
"Yo, whats wrong whit domino?"
"Agreed on the MW part, but LOL I thought Black Ops 3�s specialists were cool. Their banter at the beginning was always entertaining"
The unique executions as well
I think a mixture of both I personally like the milsim skin like the USAF PJ skin for coalition
"Yeah I�m open to new ones but I hope we keep standouts like mace,velikan,roze,Mara,dday,etc.."
"MW and Cold War are my first CODs, so I don�t have much insight into the series, but I would love it if all of our Operators and our Armory is transferred to the next MW."
"I really hope we'll be able to use the operators and skins we got in MW. I mean, if they managed to let us use skins from 2 different games in CW and WZ, they could manage to know what bundles we got in modern warfare"
If shirtless yegor isnt there im leaving mw2
I hope they expand one what we have now. Keep my boi Mace around!
I kinda wish MW2019 2 would be a campaign expansion but share the multiplayer with MW2019
I�d be surprised if they kept any of the ones we already have. They�ll likely add new ones.
"If they kept the operators and weapons of MW4 and added to them in MW5, that would be awesome, but I doubt they'd do that"
Wish I had people to play with lol all my friends are playing CW and I�m not about that
I dont play all the time but drop ur gamertag bro. I can friend u when im on next. If cw means warzone then I feel u. I dont like it lmao
You mean me and the boy laughing like hell
Why are you playing hardcore with weapons that are a one hit in core
"I�m a crossbow enthusiast. I believe it has a lot more potential then people allow. 
I use concealment from my Ghillie suit so I�m able to lie down and get off a shot with very little sound or no sound due to me also using decoys with restock. The decoys are so loud u can�t hear the arrow go off. 

Also if the enemy uses a riot shield I can hit the shield and blow them up. Eod doesn�t stop it either *"
I upload a lottt of crossbow kills

Um wtf I�m not sure that even possible
Make the camo challenges less shit and make suns less powerful
Make bushes less powerful
Yep. Proud I got Damascus but I�ll be damned if I have to do more mounted kills and longshot kills in the next cod. I prefer them to point blanks though.
"Yes, glare yiiiii!"
Agreed
And rocks
"Make doors destroyable. Throw an explosive device on a door, the door is no more."
"Or just be like [Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_(video_game)) where you can shotgun a door down completely. Alongside the explosive option, of course."
"Oh yes that'd actually improve upon the mechanics and also increase the realism, make doors destructible!"
"Also, don't delude the product the way CW is doing. 6v6 is your bread and butter, there needs to be a decent amount of those maps to make the game worth while.    
      
Just because the content is ""free"" doesn't mean we should get less than past CODs. CW releasing 3 maps since launch, and will be 5 months into a 11-12 month cycle is sad. Especially launching with so few to begin with."
"I loved mounting. I also seriously don�t get the problem with doors.

I loved the map design of this game. Rather than feeling like unnatural shooting galleries, every map looked like a real location. Something you could even see in a campaign."
"While mounting itself wasn�t bad at all. Forcing us to mount for 100 kills to get a camo, was **dreadful**. Also, make side mounting actually useful. When you side mount it cuts so much of your vision of and even tho you look like your covered literally more than half of your body is hanging out. You�re a sitting duck. And then side mounting doesn�t even reduce recoil like that."
And I liked all the alternate routes. Lots of interesting and dynamic movement options. I'm continually learning new ways to traverse the maps.
"The doors are something I love in Warzone, but I can�t say I love them in MP. There�s less of a point to them in MP, and they really just end up being a nuisance to shoot around."
Rammaza and Piccadilly are actually areas of the campaign
">Rather than feeling like unnatural shooting galleries,

That's a really good point.  Nonsense like theme parks make CoD a bizarre experience."
I�d prefer if mounting required a gun attachment.
Do you like camping as well?
"Doors encourage camping and soundwhoring.

Even ADS opening the door will get you killed if there�s a camper listening"
that's something else too. normalize creating maps from campaign locations
"Agree, thats why it added the elements that i love, i would dread if i go into a map, and the door is stucked in limbo, invisible wall and never moved an inch"
Mounting can suck my small pp
You're right about the small part
Is their a way we can get a dev or someone to see this ?
"I'm connected to one of them on linkedin, I'm sure they actually check the reddit quite often, we just need to get more feedback and more votes, then perhaps I can send to them"
"I wouldn't mind doors so much if they weren't such a dead giveaway when you sprint through them. The tactical room clearing just doesn't work in multiplayer, you die too quickly. Doors are interesting, but they belong in campaign only IMO"
"They encourage camping. You don't really gain anything from pushing through a door since the person on the side has all the cards. Especially in tactical modes. In games like BF they are fine because if someone actually is camping behind a door you can just blow a new one, but in MW without bullet pen just makes it to easy to wait behind a door."
"i hope they make sure that the balancing is better than mw's.that's the only major weakness of the game except sbmm.the meta type should change in my opinion.instead of a strict meta which only has 3 or 4 guns standing above the rest,everything should be viable imo.i also do respect your opinion,we can have different opinions mate :))))"
Yes agree mate!
"Ehhhh, I disagree about the doors. They encourage hard camping, since they allow for more spots where you can just sit and wait without someone knowing you're there. If the doors weren't a thing, some camping spots wouldn't work - and that's a good thing. I'll agree they add more realism, but from a gameplay standpoint, they kinda suck.

The main thing I want gone, is those damn mounting camo challenges. Like, fuck, have mounting in the game, sure, it's a nice option at longer ranges or when holding a sightline. But my god don't make me do 100 mounted kills per assault rifle. Longshot kills are also incredibly annoying. Camo challenges should be somewhat intuitive to how you play the game - nobody wants to sit and mount up for that long, it's boring. I don't have a problem with headshot kills, or kills without dying, or hipfires etc. But the big 3 are mounted, longshot, and crouch kills. 

We don't even know if 2022 is gonna be another Modern Warfare, though I really hope it is. Out of all the time periods they set CoD in, the modern era is one of the best. Old timey games are definitely my least favourite setting."
"If they kept everything the same but added the old minimap and fixed bullet penetration being super wonky (can go through entire buildings but some simple materials no?), it would be perfect. Contrary to others, I like how dead silence is right now."
"Dead silence how it is now, although not terrible, the footstep audio definitely needs to be reduced. With this game, footstep audio has actually become a crutch. In MP (don�t even get me started on WZ) a lot of people don�t move because they�re just waiting for those footsteps that are so loud they can tell I�m wearing Nike trainers size 9.5 from 37 feet away."
MAke Shoot The Ship permanent is something I would request.
"This! Doors were handled well I think, but for the next game, I wish you could blow open holes in them so you could better shoot through them, and make them destructible when you call in an airstrike on them, it gets kinda annoying to see them flail about. Keep all of the current guns we have in MW (2019), but with new attachments, animations, and models, plus some new ones. I want MW (2022) to feel like a direct upgrade, not a sidegrade! Mounting shouldn�t be a camo challenge, but otherwise keep it, as it helps ARs and LMGs take out snipers."
I agree!
Maybe next time they can work on weapon balancing and a changing meta
"Unpopular opinions: Maybe fix bulletpen, make coldblooded or ghost apply to tracker (or just remove tracker), buff lmgs (they aren't completive as is) fix the fucking riotshield on back player hitbox, it's like a player has a riotshield on their back but somehow has 345� bullet protection, and finally, make tactical mask actually work or nerf the stuns (they have a 100m hit radius and still apply for an insane amount of time with tac mask on).


Edit: TWO REALLY IMPORTANT ONES to me-- ONE either reduce footstep noise heard by other players or increase footstep noise heard to my player-- by that I mean when I'm walking I don't hear my steps or movement as being very loud, then I watch a killcam and it's like there was a heard of elephants in place of my player. So please at least make me able to hear how much noise I'm making or reduce the overall noise all players hear from movement AND TWO Amped either needs to apply to pistols or pistols need a weapon swap buff. Then amped needs to have a reduced effect on overkill weapons. As is I can switch lmg to lmg with amped faster than lmg to pistol. Or more irritatingly I can go ASVAL to 725 before a pistol even appears on my screen from either of those two. Please improve that."
I've actually talked to Khoa Le
Oh god please no more mounting. I don�t get how people like the mounting mechanic.
"As long as tac sprint is in the game, I�m good

Edit: tac sprint is literally my favorite mechanic in all of the cods since cod4. It makes gunplay and rush routes so much more interesting, you can play more aggressive and promotes moving around. Also the ability to tac sprint and slide cancel is such a game changer"
not having Ground War in CW is really fucking up my leveling.
Nerf shotgun range: MW 2019 is the best FPS
"Mounting = headglitching + rewarding camping + punishing agressive players + slowing down gameplay = bad. Same goes for doors. Seriously what happened to this sub? 

Just some time ago everyone was agreeing that if the game got rid of mounting, doors and safe areas it would be the best cod ever, and now all of a sudden there are all these posts asking the devs to keep that shit in the next game? Smh."
"As long as hit detection is solid, nuke is at 25 killstreak instead of 30 (!! It has always been 25 in IW  games except here, which makes zero sense since SBMM is something), minimap is the traditional way, Ghost perk works only when moving and Dead silence is a perk, I don't mind much about anything else.

Also, ""ping is king"" heuristic should be followed, I don't want to have 2x the ping I have on older COD games just to protect noobs.

Last thing: if classical maps are going to be remade, they should be remastered without a single change in the layout/objects/proportions and so on, like BOCW is doing with classical BO2 maps."
Change the radar back to what it used to be. Shooting unsilenced should reveal you on the minimap like it always has in CoD. This was honestly a make or break thing for me. I actually like CW multiplayer more basically for that reason only.
Does it not do this anymore? I thought shooting without a silencer reveals you even if you�re running ghost
"All I want gone from MW 2022 is the doors gone and the requirement to level a gun just to have the privilege of doing a camo challenge that isn't even challenging in the first place.

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna grind for camos if I have to use the dogshit guns until they're max rank just to have the privilege of doing a few camo ""challenges"", I'd rather grind for the camo from day 1 and get the shit guns out of the way fast so I can have fun with the other guns for the rest of the camos.

&#x200B;

This is especially annoying with launchers that require PLAYER KILLS to level up, good luck levelling the fucking JOKR to get camo challenges available lmao

&#x200B;

Dead Silence as a perk, Ghost only working if you move and no perks to make camping obnoxious (i.e if you wanna survive rockets and grenades get a god damn trophy system not rely on a perk) and MW 2022 might be a decent CoD game gameplay wise"
"Just don't grind any camo then, or buy a gun skin if you to lazy"
"Honestly fuck mounting, it's one of the main issues i have with the game because I feel like it's the one thing that promotes camping so much more than anything else in MW2019. It's an annoying mechanic to go against. 

I probably wouldn't hate it as much if nearly every weapon had mounted challenges for camos though honstestly."
"Mounting isn't what causes camping, it's the fact that there are perks designed to make it far superior and the devs level designers going from day 1 for ""safe spaces"" for noobs.

&#x200B;

Mounting itself is perfectly fine and well done when running around, but the issue is you have perks that lower explosive damage, Ghost works even when sitting still and combined with a trophy system you are near impossible to deal with unless you have multiple people focusing you, and no one is going to drop the objective to focus fire on ONE camper"
"To be honest, personally while trying to complete camo challenges, mounting caused me to be killed easier than moving side to side while ADS"
Dead Silence as a perk.
Yes
"Fix the sound, fix ladders and rocks. Don't copy anything from Cold War as that game is utter trash, feels like your a 700lb ape stuck in treacle. 

Optimise the game better for each platform, how can you have a top end PC or new gen console and barely get playable fps, even putting all the settings on low.

Also don't make the game 1TB, there is no need, compress things properly. 

SBBM is great if people want to challenge themselves and be sweaty but not everyone wants to do this all the time, it makes the game less fun. On this note, don't add pay to win skins or guns, prime example fuckin Rose skin or the galantry MAC10 on release."
"All I ask is that you guys keep the same amazing operators in the next game, especially D-Day"
Just want them to make maps that actually play well and aren�t shit
*** *** ** ****** **** *** ** ****** **** **
"Only thing I hope is they make maps that encourage movement. Less clutter, less hiding places, not super huge like Aniyah Palace. Or at least balance it out with more maps like Shoot house.6x6 and 10x10 can be rough at times."
"I would love if they used MW 2019 as a base ground and then added more to it, not to entirely change it, but to add more on top of what people already love.

I wish we got another year of support for MW 2019, it's the only CoD that I actually have fun playing anymore."
"Remove doors, add ninja (slight perk rebalance) traditional mini map, tone down gunsmith i.e. Pointless attachments. Superb game with throwback nostalgia elements to the original mw2. 

If they truly take on the criticism of mw2019 this could be a brilliant game."
"Along with the attachments, I get it�s for balancing purposes but not every attachment needs to have a downside. But yea there are so many attachments that there�s just no point in using"
are you trying to say in 2022 the next call of duty is going to be modern warfare without even knowing. or are you trying to say that mw2019 is still going to get support? mw2019 won't get support since call of duty is a yearly cycle the game normally only gets 1 year of support if they fix it or not that's the cycle I really doubt they will still update and support it there's more money in New cod games. and in 2022 you haven't been told what the call of duty game will be it could be mw it could be something else.
2022 being a Modern Warfare sequel is what the leaks say.
"I absolutely agree with you. It�s the small yet innovative ideas that IW put in MW that made it soo good. From doors to mounting and vaulting, it needs to come back!"
"> Must Keep: Please keep the top notch sound designs 

What game have you been playing? Have you not heard the flying vacuum cleaner in the air? footsteps are all over the place. bullets flying past your head when noone is shooting at you. this game has the worst audio of any cod to date."
"Honestly I hope they don�t do a copy paste of Treyarch with shitty dead silence as a perk. It�s so lazy like ha ha I can run anywhere and no one will hear me.

I like actually hearing footsteps like now and the weapon animations, design and sounds are beautifully designed. I really hope the audio maybe gets a bit more detailed and that�s it, as for maps I think we definitely need a mix of complex and standard ones to suit both types of players.

I also think ground war should return but bigger and more epic then before. Better designed objective play and better maps would be fantastic."
I agree with the maps. They can tone down some of the maps like Grazna and Arklov. But it�s actually annoying at how well the community received Shoot-house...but we never really got another map similar to it.
"Hahaha you for sure play like a pussy in mw, if they bring ninja into the next mw then bravo to iw I will buy the game but if it's just mw 2019 with different maps and guns then I ain't buying that pile of shit"
Disagree with mounting and doors that shit ruins the game imo
Doors are annoying but I can see why they added them and mounting is not that bad either but if had to choose what not to include I would have to say doors because it encourages camping
"Hey no prob man, we can have different opinions :)"
"Coldwar aint trash. Yes graphic not amazing, but at least it is not campers�s paradise with the freaking doors."
"Love this game, but my absolute biggest issue is the TTK. MW2019 with CW ttk and some better maps would easily the best CoD and FPS ever."

"All my games are campy as fuck all of a sudden. Wasn't like this yesturday.

Literally, all I'm hearing is my own footsteps. No gunfire at all."
I would have to I agree had the same experience today as well either super campy or super sweaty
i got 1 sided shitstomps recently on either side in ctf  usually me farming the enemy team in their spawn or i get put into a lobby with stacked clans
"I thought the exact same thing the last two days - So it wasn't just me.  


Weird."
Wait... if this was like some of my teams today you're insulting Lobsters!
"Sorry mate, I really don�t want to offend lobsters! I really like them!
Especially after boiled and with some pepper"
This happened to me with three consecutive matches today in HQ/Hardpoint mode that I literally turned off my Xbox. It sucks being the only one going positive and even the only one playing the objective while your teammates play in a whole different universe.
Yeah it's definitely been off. Played a whole night of doing REALLY well (one match 18/0 next 29/5) and it never really bumped me up just kept putting me with people I shouldn't be massacring like that.
I had the same issue I changed the server and it looked better
"Yeah I have the same issue, it's like my teamamtes are brain dead potatoes wile the enemy team is jump/dropshotting as if it was to win money. I haven't even bothered to play the past 3 days because I'm not gonna torture myself trying to deal with it because it's like the sbmm is stuck because even if you do bad you won't get an easier lobby, I ""unintentionally"" Reverse boosted but it was more of me just constantly killing myself out of frustration and it didn't do nothing."
"Off-peak matches can get pretty wild. I had someone on my team with two LMGs as a loadout, all they did was run to the same spot on Rammaza at the covered courtyard overlooking that alley and hipfire, then switch weapons, then hipfire. Or that's probably the plan, because they always died before the first LMG ran out. They went 2-15. Immediate next match I get teamed up with completely mad lads, our best player somehow managed 47 kills in regular 6v6 TDM."
Probably reverse boosting. Whats the point in hipfiring an LMG at range? Not gonna hit anything at all.
some guns don't show attachments at all until you're a certain level
"Attachments are hidden until you get close to unlocking them. There is a ""no stock"" attachment for the 680 which is just a pistol grip. I don't know what level it is but if you keep using it you will eventually unlock it. I have no idea why they did this, it's like that for all guns."
Dude that was epic AF
The locals of Verdansk are probably going nuts
The zombies are all doing the wave in celebration of my momentous accomplishment
LOVE THIS!!!!!   I love playing Face Off  Verdansk Stadium and shooting the goals in!  I'm sure I piss off some of my teammates being focused on futball instead of killing.  And I love to do that move just mow down someone while shooting the ball too!  fun fun fun
I have never seen a RAM-7 user who isn�t a movement god. Good stuff
"god the burst renetti is basically a primary, i love that gun so much (and the ram is amazing as well.) good stuff"
I absolutely hate that building... and that one way bullet proof glass
Hmm... a lot of players playing Ground War recently... Why?
How do you know that lol
"Spitfire barrel
No stock
30rd
Stippled Grip
Merc foregrip"
"I�ll give it a try. I really like the holger but if I�m being honest it�s not that good, a slight buff to rate of fire and more barrel attachments would help a lot if they added it"
"Mono, cqb barrel, 30rd, ads skeleton stock (can't remember the name) sleigh of hand"
"Compensator, ranger foregrip, 30 round mags, axis stock, stippled grip tape. Is probably the best set up for it."
doubt it
"Compensator, No Stock, 30R Mag, Stippled Grip and maybe even Fully Loaded, since the starting ammo will be gone very quick if you don't find someone who dropped a 5.56 gun"
How about fix your aim. Holy fuck
This is your mind on aim assist
[deleted]
I�m really confused. This clip just looks like your trash and can�t aim. Where�s the hacking or issues with MW?
you aimed everywhere but at him
[deleted]
"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because unitedgoatK was already dead"
Cold War gets boring very quick in my opinion but yes agree add more content please IW
"CW is a testament to why the people wanting every cod to be like the old cods should be ignored, it�s damn boring playing the same mindless run and gun simulator year in year out"
Yeah I uninstalled it and probably won�t ever touch it again. I much prefer MW anyways

"I tried the Beta and the free week that they gave us and was bored out of my mind, immediately went back to MW 2019, elite game."

They won�t bet activision is making them work harder for mw2 to release in 2021 with bf6 being set in modern combat
"IW is likely working on MW2022 at this point to meet the yearly release schedule set by Activision. It happens every year so I won't expect much from anyone.

If Warzone wasn't tired of MW I doubt there would have been any updates (outside of patching exploits) when CW was released.

If IW / Activision cared about the community they would have given some control of MW through map voting, community servers etc before the release of CW. They won't even keep popular playlists like 24/7 shipment, 24/7 shoothouse etc all the time and based on the number of posts on reddit alone it's something the community wants but IW ignores."
"Are they back on a 3 year rotation? What will the 2021 game be? (Obviously we don�t know yet, I mean any rumors?)"
"Exactly. I swear nobody on this subreddit has played any other call of duty, they are always left out to die when the new game comes out. There is 0 chance of anything specifically coming to MW, if they release ANYTHING at all significant/relevant to the multiplayer only, I will eat a dick."
Community servers would be very awesome
"Because all the haters jumped the ship to CW, only ppl left are ppl who enjoyed MW all along

My self not included, i still hate MW with passion"
"Why are you guys so shy to release new Modern Warfare content. 
It is even more popular than BOCW.

We all know the existances of those 3 new weapons, all those unreleased Stores bundles and Soap MacTavish / Sparks."
"There�s probably the same amount of people playing MW as Cold War even now. Cold War was just so disappointing they completely rushed it, I understand there�s a pandemic going on and stuff but if they spent another year on it then it would have been way better. I would have been more than happy to wait another year, I could play modern warfare forever without getting bored tbh"
"> It is even more popular than BOCW

No. People keep having this strange idea that Reddit is everyone.

COD is THE casual players game. The same players to whom the latest cod is always the only cod.

And to be fair, in the grand scheme, both player bases are peanuts compared to the amount of people only playing Warzone.

So releasing new content for what's (in their eyes) a done game... Not going to happen."
">It is even more popular than BOCW.

How do you know that?"
They did release the unmasked roze bundle so hopefully they release more in the future but idk activision has to make sure cold war is the main focus
"They�re not shy, Activision don�t want people playing MW so they holding back the unreleased temporarily or potentially permanently so we will buy Cold War and play Cold War"
"Because it doesn't really matter business wise. Warzone keeps the cash flowing from modern warfare and black ops has already sold a ton of copies and gets free purchases from people who like the CW weapons in warzone. 

They don't have to do the work on any type of ""timeline"" because people will still throw money at them hand over fist at the end of the day. It's wild"
At this point I'd be happy with shoot the ship being a permanent playlist. I don't really expect anything else for the game since they have moved on to CW and IW is probably working on the next cod game right now. Activision really should move to a new schedule where a new cod releases every other year instead of every year.
"Shoot the ship and rust 24/7 should 100% be permanent at this point tbh they need to bring back map voting aswell, I�m getting really tired of leaving and joining lobbies cause I keep getting put in shitty maps like azhir cave"
"I agree but unfortunately releasing a new game every year guarantees $1bn + a year in revenue. I just don't think they can give that up. The only way things will change if people stop buying the yearly releases and I think MW has been the closest to convince people to do that. 

That might mean Activision will be afraid of making such a solid game again. It has hurt CW sales"
"Lol oh the irony after all the shit they gave the devs 
Hopefully y�all been good this year, maybe for Christmas you�ll get a dlc sticker bundle"
"2020: �FUCK THIS CAMPY GAME FUCK THE FOOTSTEP NOISES SBMM REEEEEE�  
2021: �pweeease can we have more MW content�  

Hilarious"
Lol
This game is done sorry guy. No cod in history lasts that long. Buy the new one or wait till 2021 cod.
Sad but true
Nah WWII and BO3 had new guns come out far after the new one came out.
Bo3 got new weapons even after the release of infinite warfare why can�t we get those new MW weapons
CoD 2 is still getting new content through community mods and servers
"The thing is, all this new stuff is already in the game. They added the pistol, SMG and LMG as well as many other skins. It�s all there. Just a press of a button could release this"
"To think that black ops 3 got new guns until 2019 and they decide ""yeah 3 new bundles is good after the new game releases"""
I'd settle for a map filter
God yes. Turn off all the shit MW ones and leave the 3 to 4 maps that are semi acceptable.
server browser
Put shoot the ship for ever too pls
First time ?
"Cold war guns still in my opinion ruin wz, practically many ARs in MW are obsolescent if you want to be somewhat competitive against the FFAR and the MAC10 monkeys"
Please keep MW and Cold War separate.
Also why won�t they implement map voting. What is the downside
I have legit been thinking this for a while. Why is that just WZ and CW keep getting content released and not MW. I find MW to be a far more better game than CW just something about CW doesn�t sit right with me
"Because every CoD game gets abandoned after its year of updates. It's nothing new. I hate it too, but it's always going to be a thing.

What I personally don't understand, is why we can't use stuff like watches and charms from the battle pass, that are usable in warzone, but are completely invisible in MW, even though they run on the same engine, and within the same game. It makes no sense. Stickers are the ONLY things we can use from the battle pass - and stickers suck.

I don't mind CW, but I prefer MW by far."
"You�re lucky that they haven�t abandoned the game completely like they did to Black Ops 4/Blackout, not to mention every other older CoD.  

Literally one CoD in history has gotten new content after the first year, and it took adding Black Ops 3 to PlayStation Plus for free for it to happen as motivation to preorder BO4."
Hackers need sorting first
"The most frustrating bit is that this content is ready to go and ready to be released yet they arent acknowledging it or giving us a release time

Its not like we�re asking for an entire new seasons worth of content to be made, we�re asking for the content thats finished in the files and currently usable in game by possibly unintentional means to be given to us 

Like fuck dude! Soap is a fully playable operator by modders and devs! All he�s missing is his operator intro video! So like where the fuck is he?!?"
I like Cold War more than MW tbh but it�s so stupid for Activision to completely abandon Modern Warfare
"It isn�t stupid it�s just basic business,why would they release new content for MW when they have Warzone and Cold War with much higher priority?"
Honestly this is just my opinion but if all they are gonna do is release more store bundles then just don�t. I�m all for the guns but I�m tired of all the store bundles in MW and CW
"I want multiplayer maps for �Crossfire,� �Showdown,� and �The Bog� from the original MW. That�s the whole reason I bought the game, as I�d expected a lot more content from the original game."
Yeah it's insane how they haven't made this game their main liveservice game. This game could very well survive for years if they double down on microtransactions and updates
"I'll stick to playing MW 2019 for a couple of years atleast. I did the same with Modern Warfare 2 back in the day. I played it years after release even when Ghosts and Black Ops 3 etc. was out there already. MW2, Black Ops 2 and MW2019 were the only cod games I truly enjoyed playing."
My Mw is big enough already. How much more can they add to this 282 gb of a beast
"Nooo
Stop with the fucking 20� bundles"
"I would not be so pissed for MW content if I didn't knew they have a season worth of content ready to go in the game files, what includes three guns, two operators., and even a fucking Ground War map, but it's being held hostage because Activision feels they need to push the dumpster fire Treyarch shitted out."
"I would love zombies in MW just port the WZ zombies to MW and rework survival to work, they could even sell some cosmetic DLC to cover the cost."
Thats a good idea in theory but i dont see them doing it in any meaningful way that wouldnt feel lazy.
Always been like that. Always about the money
Why would they though? They're probably working on a new game
"Hell if we can�t get **NEW** content, may we at least get our *old* content back?

First they seemingly accidentally removed the Warzone specific Missions (you can still do the Core ones and the Co-Op ones). 

But amongst the Core and Co-Op ones, they�ve seemingly stopped producing those �quest chains� too (in fairness 3ish a season was generous, so maybe even just 1 chain a season). 

They stopped giving us Operator Mission chains in our BPs (Kreuger and I think Charly are two first day Operators, and neither have been given a BP Operator Mission).

It�s sometimes the basic stuff that is most frustrating to me when devs start becoming complacent"
The problem is that I don�t think it is up to IW. It is ultimately activisions decision. They made their money off MW. They want to make more off of BOCW.
Agreed. Love how the Cold War beta was more fun than the actual release. Still was more fun than now. 100% will be playing MW from now on.
Well the CX9 is definitely a mw gun. and that one rook lmg in Warzone is also definitely a Mw weapon. So I think IW does have something planned.
"Has no one played any other call of duty ever? As soon as the new game comes out by the other dev, the other game dies. Plain and simple. There won't be any other content coming out."
Give us season 7 dear IW
Maybe if we ask in Chinese :(
I dont understand why they switch between resurgence trios and quads. Put them.both in the menu.
I'm waiting for the samurai skin for ronin...
I just want permanent Shipment!
Are we really at the point of begging companies to sell us MORE overpriced bundles in our games? Fucking insane.
"Everything in mw is better, looks, style, sounds and so on, i prefer it, but honestly i don't understand the people acting like cw is a completely different game, boring and so on.. come on now, they're not THAT different. Yes mw is better, but people are being overly dramatic about it."
How many times you guys gonna go through this circle jerk
"I think we all expected MW19 to be a game as a service but we got the regular cod life-cycle. Any content we see from the datamines are most likely gonna be saved for it's sequel. I think Covid impact mixed with poor scheduling also fucked the Warzone storyline.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't even be surprised if the Soap bundle will get turned into a pre-order bonus for MW2, like that weird version of Woods."
"They STILL have not adapted the MW2 map ""Invasion"", which is just outside and above Euphrates Bridge."
"They're sitting on the new content until the hype for BOCW is well and truly dead. If they'd have released the new content back in december, people would have just seen it is a sign that MW is still alive and would see no reason to buy the next one. Only once everyone has completely given in and bought BOCW will they release the new content"
"�Boss they just made a reddit post saying we should add the new guns� 

�That�s a good idea release them right this second� That�s not how a business works whatever date activision has planned is the date they�ll come out no matter how many reddit posts you make."
I�ve had 3k CP sitting in my account for a month waiting for the Rainbow Sparkles bundle... it was added to the game in December but still hasn�t been released :/
"Good thing that CP Carries over between games, save it for the next one."
I had a gun with rainbow sparkles in blueprint gun game the other day. Few games actually.
"As if they listen to reddit posts like these, lmfao."
"In what universe are you living in? Activi$ion has no plans to allow IW to release jack shit, to them MW should have died when Cold War was released but because it was an inferior game no one wants to jump ship, Bobby Kotick and his ilk want their Billions to show their quality gains and so MW MUST die in order for it to do so...."
I left Cold War and moved back to MW. It�s just a better game.
"I uninstalled bo cow yesterday. Fuck that game. I absolutely hate it. Did buy the battlepass but damn I can't play it anymore, the sbmm, the mixed playstyle of people and just the general atmosphere in lobbies isn't fun anymore. MW was already better to begin with. Do wish they'd make new content. Not store bundles tho...."
"There not gonna reply, they�ve gone silent and it�s so annoying"
"Activitision needs to stop making cod for a few years and focus on making MW and CW reach their full potential. Both games have a really solid foundation (MW more so than CW, but then again it's had more time to cook) it would be a shame for them to just move on in a few months. Both aesthetics are really great they just both need time and content. More maps and game modes would really solidify these two as the best cods ever."
I just want a new Captain Price bundle
And stop giving us cold war themed garbage for MW. This last battle pass was bullshit
Please for God's sake make MW independent again
They have no idea how much theyre missing out on :/
It�s over. Move on. Cold War is the now and same thing is going to happen when COD 2021 gets released.
Bro it�s Activision they�d literally shut down MW�s servers today if it meant profit. Stop talking like it�s a regular gaming company.
You think that isn�t a regular gaming company?
Release a bruen with tracer rounds already
They released one with shadow tracers...Velikan pack
"I wish they create operator bundles with the base skins for season pass characters (Mara, Ghost, Alex, Price, Lerch, Farah, and Nikolai) because I missed the first three passes and didn�t get to tier 100 in the sixth so now I can�t unlock Nikolai or the first three others. They should also allow players who already own a character but not their base skin the option to unlock the original operator bundles (Like Gaz, Talon, Roze, etc.)"
Yeah i don't get why old Battlepass skins aren't available to buy after some time from their season lol. They are losing money
There are 2 bundles that include both season 1 Mara skins. They just haven't released them publicly for some reason. Some people seen and were able to buy them in the store like 2 weeks ago but a lot of people never got the chance. Here's The [1500 COD Point Bundle](https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/bundles/400295-battle-pass-season-1-pack) and the [2400 COD Point Bundle](https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/bundles/400305-battle-pass-season-1-pack).
They won�t MW is dead
"All I have to say is this: add a small map playlist, add shipment, shoothouse, rust, Cheshire park, hardhat, and scrapyard. Make it fun, everyone wants smaller maps to grind out the massive amount of camos or simply just want to have fun. It would keep the game alive, add more stuff it needs it. I remember BO4 was said it was going to be the most supported COD of all time, that it was going to be support it for years on end but ultimately it was kinda abandoned. I don�t want the same for MW, the engine, movement, gunfights it�s just amazing. There�s so many things they could do, maybe host even more tournaments in different game modes and you can win even more blueprints. I know they will probably just fix it here and there but one can only hope."
"I just want the PS4 timed exclusive Combat Packs and Mission/Blueprints, especially the unreleased Fatal Freeze, released for Xbox/PC."
I dont think they check this sub anymore:(
"I wouldn�t blame them,this community doesn�t say anything worth listening to"
Haven't touched the game since they renamed it Warzone and gave it that shitty cold war makeover
Mate you�re acting like infinity ward gets to make these decisions. Activision is actively screwing modern warfare
And fix the Field Upgrades glitch so I can unlock the remaining Operator skins and Calling Cards!
"lol you think IW has been on this subreddit in the last year?

They clearly do not give a shit"
They said killhouse and a other map will come. But i hope for terminal or highrise man that would be insane
"It's like people haven't learned.  


Unfortunately they won't, since they are busy developing a new game. This is what we paid for with yearly releases-"
Just make shoot the ship a permanent playlist and I would be elated.
"Sadly they'll just keep on letting us grind to unlock guns for a game some of us don't even have. Lol. Seriously, I sometimes forget ALL the weapons in the Season upgrades are for Warzone/CW and get really upset when it says I have a new weapon and I can't find it anywhere. If it wasn't for the fact that I just enjoy online fps matches to kill time I wouldn't play. My incentive for unlocking new weapons and gun builds is gone cuz they're only for a game mode I don't play and a game I'm most likely never gonna buy."
Where is the The Singularity!?
"Won't ever happened, i never saw them release new content for a CoD game after a new one got released

Only way to convince them would be to convince em Cold War is the shit but Cold War sucks so we'll have to see next year"
"As much as I like to shit on MW, it is an overall good game and I'd LOVE to see more content from it. The red screen in MW really makes it unplayable and how ugly the lighting is but it's an overall fun game. Sniping was SO GOOD"
I'm bummed they got rid of the 100 season challenges to unlock the animated emblem
Yes please!
Lol
Is the game dead now since they put out Cold War? It�s a shame since MW was such a good game. There hasn�t been one like it in a bit
I think they�re saving everything for the new mw2 it seems they have completely cut new content for this game
"Honestly idgaf if they add remake maps or old weapons since i really hate CW MP,"
i might get downvoted to hell..but you guys must have forgot whats going on..while i hate cw myself...i havent forgotten that when  a new cod releases the precvious one stops getting content....how did everyone forget this
"IW stop getting rid of shoot the ship, that's how you fucking lose customers."
Not going to happen. They're trying to undermine it pretty bad. All about that ~~shareholders~~ Cold War.
Any chance Terminal multiplayer map gets some love?
So with the new guns. Did anyone else use the cx9 that was ground loot the first few days of the update? It shredded like nothing else close range. I would fucking love that gun
"Yeah great, that will really improve the game and bring me back. Last time I played I was like ""Wow, there just isn't enough people in literal clown suits shooting fucking laser guns that explode people into lightning when they die"".

Really looking forward to the new WW2: Disco Boogaloo as well."
They could still make more money from people buying the multiplayer even if it�s just new guns
They don't give a fuck and never will. Stop playing it and let it die. Maybe they'll see that overall it's the community that's supporting your game that matters. If not well R.I.P. COD franchise
Make everything in store earn able in game challenges. Fix audio and cheating along with new maps.
"Lol. I stopped playing mw once the first cw update happened. They completely fucked mw. The fact that it�s not updated for adaptive triggers tells you they have no plans to continue with mw. It�s all about money, activation seriously doesn�t give a shit about player complaints."
Never gonna happen.next cod is right around the corner
"Left MW a while ago, everytime I try to get back into it it just feels like a convoluted mess right now."
potential*
Totally agree with you
"I haven't played CoD in a decade, my last one was black ops 2 and I picked up CoD only because of MW2019 and still play it so much even today."
"Modern warfare is proof activision needs to get rid of the yearly cod system, it�s so outdated compared to other games it�s unbelievable, they should�ve given MW 2 years (at least) to make content- we�d be in season 8 if activision rid of this stupid system- but they never will, people will keep buying the next call of duty no matter what."
"We need a 2 year gap between games with all the new stuff, they do. Also to polish the games more."
Yea I don�t understand why they have to release a new game every year. If the current game is popular don�t try to kill it to get people on the new game. All you end up doing is diluting both player bases. Keep updating and supporting the popular one. Micro transactions are a big enough source of income to justify it anyway
"I love the old CoDs but MW has brought so muuch to the franchise that I can�t do without like editing your classes in-game etc
Definitely one of the best CoD game ever made"
Bring back the Yegor bundles while you�re at it.
No because they're releasing mw2 later this year
I just want shoot the ship for the camp grind tbh. Was never going to go for Damascus but seen as I didn�t really like BOCW anywhere near as much as MW then I had to find something to do for at least a year.
"[I made a similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/kj9abz/mw_could_have_been_continued_for_atleast_5_more/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) a while back and it did gain considerable traction on this sub. 

This is what MW fans have been saying ever since CW hit and the sales numbers show it. MW has potential, But Activision wants to shove CW down our throats to cut their losses. And get IW to focus on the upcoming cod. 

tl;dr we wont get what we are asking for, but atleast we sent a message that we wont accept a rushed, subpar game."
https://youtu.be/M1eIkypGwMU
Why was there no play list update for MW?
I feel like MW is dead and they just draggin it with CW
"The reason why people prefer Arcady boring 3-lane maps is because of the gun leveling and gun camo grind. People want maps that requires minimal amount of thinking, and being as trigger-happy as you can be to grind weapon XP and camos. This leveling system needs to be overhauled for the community to start playing the game differently, and as such appreciate diversity and fresh content. 

How many times you saw a post �now that the Damascus grind is over, I can start enjoying the game�? That�s why all my friends want shipment, shoot house, nuke town and all of those small maps. You know it is a major issue, when your teammates gets pissed off because you�re collecting tags on grind! They don�t want the match to be over to rack kills for their grind. 

If the developer changes the system, only then people will start enjoying the good aspects of any game"
"Would you pay for an update? The decision to drop MW is obviously to drive revenue by increasing CW sales. So to encourage Activision to release more for MW it could be paid for. 

I'm good with paid for dlc. I've had my money's worth out of MW (and then some), and still really enjoy playing, so if enough players felt like me, new paid for content could be a win-win for the player base and activision."
Are we really at the point of begging companies to sell us MORE overpriced bundles in our games? Fucking insane.
Are we really at the point of begging companies to sell us MORE overpriced bundles in our games? Fucking insane.
Hopefully they give us shipment 24/7 before they abandon us again.
"Unfortunately, they don�t control that, Activision does and they probably won�t release it because Cold War is the main game rn"
thought i heard rumors for a season 7 battle pass soon with soap and the new guns and stuffs
"You should be asking Activision not IW, they�re most likely the ones holding back the unreleased content so people will buy Cold War"
"Sorry son IW is gone, they are developing their new game to be released in a few months."
"I agree on that MW is by far my favorite I went into kingslayer on friday and got 15Kills 
........Please give me my DamnNation Rytec its the Only thing that makes me feel safe for quickscoping"
MW way better than CW
"It's getting old, especially for a COD. They're going to focus on their next game at some point"
"I DONT UNDERSTAND!!!
I bought the game at launch and played it until Cold War. Everytime I insert MW disc it�s like I don�t own the game anymore !!! What happened ?"
Mine was doing this a couple weeks ago really bad I ended up having to delete the whole game and redownload it. It�s been working fine since.
"I have been having this issue for long, will try reinstalling and will give an update"
Ok ill try it out thanks
Yup having that issue with split screen. I have tried to redownload and hadn�t worked. I just keep restarting my Xbox to play 1-3 games lol
Yea thats exactly what happens to me just 2 to 3 ganes no issues but than it takes about an hour to do it again
"Umm it's probably core\_count - 1 by design, to leave resources available to your OS and the rest of the system. Using all cores for the came is probably not a good idea.

For reference, mine is a 10-core and config shows 9."
I have 12 cores and mine is set to 12.
"Gunfight knives only
It was in the weekly playlist so it should come back in around a month i guess"
Knifey Spoony Duos
Knife only Gunfight ?
"Thing is, you�re on a subreddit that�s everything modern warfare. 

Most likely the people that continue to stay on this subreddit well past the prime of this game, are people who continually enjoy it. 

Saying that though, there are a lot of us, expect bias answers, but for good reason ;)"
"Not really. The gunplay, graphics, sound design, and everything else are amazing but the playerbase is getting smaller, and only the more dedicated players stick around, so it�s far more toxic. The new CoD game later this year will make this issue much worse in addition to people naturally quitting. Most of the maps are absolutely terrible too, and a lot of the fun game modes have been deleted or are pretty dead."
"Maps suck except for a few. The game feels great and the movement and weapons are awesome. Like others have said it's very campy and that's the way it was designed. I only play hardcore but if you're with friends, custom lobbies are a blast. I think I'm moving back to Battlefield on next release personally."
What are everyone�s K/Ds in this game there are a lot of run a gun players in this game. All CODs have campers. All CODs have the jump and drop shot shooters.
"I haven't played COD in probably 3-4 years.   I decided to come back and took a few days to decide between MW and CW, and I'm not regretting choosing MW"
"Multiplayer plays more like a tactical shooter then other titles, I recommend it"
This game is far from tactical the hell? Play it fast like any other CoD.
"People are misunderstanding you saying it plays more like a tactical shooter, you aren�t saying it plays like a tactical shooter, you�re just saying compared to the other cods it plays more like a tactical shooter, but not a tactical shooter."
Thanks man
"Tactical shooter?? It's the complete opposite of a tactical shooter, pretty much no caution, strategy, care or planning. It's just run shoot die repeat...."
"I remember buying the pack in the store when it came out, and then next season there was another dog execution I could've gotten for free if I didn't waste my COD Points."
And like 10 more after that....like thanks for making Talon absolutely a waste of money since the dog was the selling point and now everyone gets it
Where�s Indiana?
Oh crap I forgot but I don't have a black dog but I will try to paint one
"Low key hope that the actor for Talon sees this

I know hes on reddit sometimes"
Pay for more blueprints. That�s the point.
"No thats not the point, I buy one because I like the look of it, not the attachments. (Death Certificate) for example...if I don't want the extended mag on it and put the ""stock"" mag on it so I can add something else, I lose the lower jawbone and tongue....what I am saying is that even though I change the mag or whatever, the image should still be there."
"Lifetime console player here. I've played over a dozen FPS games extensively (with 500+ hours or more on each). Never played any real game on PC other than Minecraft. I tried COD on PC for the first time recently. Spent about 20 minutes playing against bots and then went to MP for about an hour. I was performing better on PC than i do on console. That was with basically zero shooter experience on PC. If I played it for a few days i could significantly outperform what I can do on console. A mouse allows for infinitely more control over your aim and recoil especially at long range. In my opinion it's not even close, mouse is way easier. That's why I never play with crossplay."
It is and I agree with you but somehow controller players kick ass. I'm probably just dogshit in cod and good in other games or something.
"Everyone seems to think the grass is greener on the other side. Yeah I think cod is meant to have a low skill floor for whatever input device you choose and there are advantages to both. Aim assist is necessary for controller but a mouse is more smooth and precise, it�s sort of a pick your poison situation and hard to compare controller to mouse"
I know but a lot of people plays with aim assist off including 2 of my friends and they somehow usually do better then people with aim assist. All the other fps games have aim assist too but cod players just seem to kick everyone's asses
How good you are is how good you are. Some people are used to controller some are used to M&K. It�s just how used to it you are and practice. That being said. PC players have about 3x the FPS. (Almost irrelevant right now with how bad the servers have been but it�s still true) Meaning everything in the game and on their screen loads fractions of a second faster. But that tiny amount of a second means everything in a game like this. It�s actually a huge advantage especially if they are a sweat. And not just that but the wider FOV on PC gives them more in the screen to see at a time. And the FOV also helps PC players with recoil control just because how it makes everything look. So a good PC with a good player will beat consoles a majority of the time.  Gameplay and positioning dependent. But you can play on PC with M&K or controller. And that�s where the skill debate between players really starts to take place but idgaf about that. I�m so used to controller if I played on pc I�d get smacked around using M&K. But if I played Pc with a controller. I bet my kills per game would go up even more.
"Controller players on PC are a force to be reckoned with, I wanna give it a shot in the next little while. I'm just too used to using a mouse at this point."
"i play both pc and controller. on pc i feel like i have more control of precision and aim in general while on controller i feel like the movement is easier and comfortable ( the dash crouch sprint these things)
honestly i prefer controller bcs it just feels right on this game and ive been playing shooters on pc for much longer"
"If you think Modern Warfare is bad in this regard, you should try Cold War.

Everything about these two games were designed with controllers/bad players in mind. The aim assist is stronger than ever, the maps are very porous with sometimes as many as 5 lines of sight and camping spots, the lag comp doesn't have a ping limit and favors the shooter no matter how terrible the network connection is. Cold War even adds visual recoil and visual flinch which, in practice, really only nerfs KBM users.

KBM still has an overall advantage (for skilled players), but there will be a *lot* of moments where you'll get lasered by the aim assist or feel like console players have walls due to how strongly the lag comp gives them a handicap. And if you run into XIM/CM players? Well, that's a legal cheat in the CoD universe, get used to it.

Ultimately, the blunting of the skill ceiling in CoD has been a gradual process, but MW and Cold War are definitely giant and blatant leaps in making bad players happy. It has been great for business and unfortunately it's here to stay for the franchise. We'll get downvoted for spelling out the truth because as you could probably guess, the majority of players are not great and thus, benefit from these new game design choices.

Bigger picture is worse - this is endgame for all competitive multiplayer games since most game studios goals are to maximize profits. My advice is to support indie studios who still care about competitive integrity (they're quite few in number) or just stick to older games as try to keep them alive as much as possible."
"Hell No I don't think its bad. I love it actually. It's a good practice. I do agree the fact that the map seems like it is really designed for controller players, filled with right narrow spaces. There is only a few places the opponents could be in and if you aim in the general direction the aim assist kicks in and I'm dead. 

I don't know if you played world at war when cod was initially designed for PC you could see the much better map designed with wide open spaces and not too many places for camping. Really love that game and still very occasionally play it with old friends. It feels like the map design of battlefield. I'd the new cod can take design clues of battlefield 3 and 4 TDM maps it would be awesome. Really love bf4, still play it every week.

Speaking of Indie developers, I actually play quite a lot of them including dusk, squad, insurgency sandstorm. But do you know about the game world war 3? The game was incredible. It's supposed to be a game like battlefield with cod like killstreaks. Sadly due to almost know advertisement the game died. Still waiting for news on that game. But you should check it out."
Damn i know those felt satisfying
100%. this game's headshot sound effect is top tier
Bro you�re a beast with that 357.
thanks man
What that setup for the revolver?
Lockwood scope+LW TRIGGER+ADS LASER+STIPPLED GT+Sleight of Hand
Noice. What do mastery camos look like on it?

"Really? If find that kind of hard to believe considering my experiences. Unless I'm literally the worst player in the world, which I doubt.

Does it become more accurate as you play more games consecutively or something?"
nah honestly ur probably in that bracket where it�s the sweaty sniper kids that go neutral a lot so they don�t go higher up in da SBMM pool
Try different playlists. It takes a good while for it to kick in because of how much more gradual it is compared to cold war.
What game modes are you playing and who with?
I usually play team deathmatch and ground war just by myself.
Eu encontro jogo normalmente
 this image so cursed idek why... I hate it
So cursed

This one is Old Comrades Price I think.
"Having the same problems, keep getting the packet loss symbols on the left of my screen, FPS drops to near nothing. After the last small update I started seeing this. Not sure what to do."
"This has been a thing for me after every major update.  Always kind of simple to figure out what to change to make it play like normal.  This last outbreak update was a pita though.  Really broke my game, graphically. Cold war is a little better, but still looks worse than before.  
I really thought dropping the resolution down would make it better, but it didn't.  And I'll be damned if I play at a lower resolution on low settings.  I know I don't have  a state of the art system...but def one than can handle what I'm throwing at it. If I find any solutions I'll post them here....cause the search will continue."
Same issue here
"I'm gonna jump on here in a minute for a couple games.  I lowered my resolution to 1080 from 1440, but switched my settings to high.  That didn't help much.  So when I go on I'm going to play at 1080 on a 1440 monitor with the settings at medium.  Hopefully it helps.  Won't be ideal, since I know my system can handle more...but maybe it's at least playable.  I'll post an update in an hour and a half or so."
Damn dude you on fire.
That�s a one a spicy a meatball.
Damn! Wish I was this good.

Isn't the Mac 10 a cold war gun. Hence you need to do in cold war mp.
Yeah I�m pretty sure you have to play CW to unlock
Doesn�t work on mw. Idk about Warzone but I�m pretty sure you have to do it in CW multiplayer
if you didn't unlock it last season from the battlepass you have to unlock it via cold war
"I�m experiencing the same problem. I get the double kill icon on my screen when using my AUG in Kingslayer, but no progression on the challenge :("
I literally just finished the challenges for the Mac 10 and it is still locked even though I have the 15/15 challenges completed-_-
Tournament reward? Does it look good with mastery camos?
"Yes its the Tournament reward

Sry i don't have them - _-"
"nothing special with completionist camos, looks like the ordinary shotgun"
Do people actually find these amusing? Cringey as fuck

Gonna need that on roze so she can look more ridiculous.
its a Cold War knife you only can use it in Cold War and warzone
"you cant get in contact with them about it as the will not discuss perm bans, i got banned on another account (my dumbass had cheat engine open from a different game) and just made a new one and rebought the game"
i didn�t even have any cheats open or anything it was just for fun i suppose
How did you know it was permanently banned? I just logged in after not having played for a month or two and turns out I'm shadow banned. Im thinking it might be a perma ban since i haven't played for a while and it seems like a shadow ban would be lifted after a week or so...
"no i go onto battle.net and it says account banned, when i start up the game i get the �account permanently banned� message"
Do we know if any of these accidental/false permabans from the most recent wave are being reversed?
"most likely not to be honest, they truly couldn�t care less at all. in their eyes this is most likely a way to move people on to cold war"
"Levelling up has changed. Now once you reach 55, Prestige levels begin."
That�s good to know. I ain�t as mad about that. I freaked thinking my game was hacked or glitched. But NOW the game KEEPs booting me out of games saying I have to BUY the game. When I have a psychical disc
So I have to build my level back up to 55 again? Because the game nerfed me as if I was a fresh new player. But all of my stats are the same.
"Happens to me on Xbox one, I�m thinking maybe cuz that brick is 8 years old :/ Not 100% sure why it happens but it works after a couple of more clicks"
"Does it to me when I don�t have the disc in, even though I own MW and CW, and WZ is free."
"If you are on xbox, it will tell you to buy modern warfare multiplayer if you have played warzone without the MW disc in recently. Happened to me a bunch until somebody helped me out and told me that if you go into your xbox settings you can alternate/clear your MAC address and it fixes the issue. Works every time for me but it's still a pain in the ass so I just always make sure I have the MW disc in when I launch warzone so I don't have to fool with it every time"
Happens to me when I open warzone with no disk. After a hard reset fixes it for me on Xbox
"If you start a match with CodCaster (I think it's in the private match/trials menu) then it puts a black background behind killfeed/obituary items. Looks [like this](https://preview.redd.it/tjukizk7uiy31.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d65928104d418f05101c8dc432912436e976a2)

So if you can't find an image of it on google you can always just start a codcaster match, run off a cliff, and take a screenshot."
I�m on console and taking a pic of a tv screen isn�t great lol but my buds on pc so maybe he can screen cap it. Thanks!
"Try something like �fall damage killfeed� or something. Yes, you get some stuff for it if you look that up, but if it doesn�t work tell me"
Has your lag been horrible too?
Yeah and people don�t believe me when I say it�s lag
"Lag has been terrible in MW for a long time. The odd thing I found is that when I play Cold War, my connection is a lot better."
happened to me once on ps4 however I no longer own a ps4 also im pretty sure its just a bug idk why it happens but ye. you should just try and download them again
"Ah man, this has never happened before but I'm not gonna be impressed if this becomes a frequent thing"
"Happens to next gen a lot more often, really annoying"
"I really hope this doesn't happen again, have a near 50gb Download for stuff that I shouldn't have to re download"
Have you got a hard drive connected? Sometimes when hard drive disconnects accidentally or if you�ve done it yourself somehow then the data becomes lost. It�s happened to me a few times (I�m on console.) I had to download a few packs again. If that�s not the case for you then it�s most likely a bug
Yeah external hardrive for my ps4 downloads. I don't think I've had a disconnect between my last play and today that I am aware of. But I did get a message to say that my harddrive was full so I don't know if that's caused a few packs to delete. Never happened before and I've filled up that hardrive plenty of times. So it makes me wonder. Thank you for the response
Worth it? Fuck. That. Take up more than 20% of a fucking terabyte? Gimme a break...
"Nah there�s tons of more stuff on the full game. There�s a few packs for each part of the game. Like campaign, spec ops and multiplayer all have a few packs that need to be downloaded so it�s quite a lot when all added together. I�m on console rn and it takes around 200gb (warzone included) so I�ve had to get an extended hard drive. But it�s 100% worth it mate, way better then Cold War. Cold War has to be one of the most rushed cods ever, I would only ever play that to level up guns for warzone. The engine, feel of the game and flow is just so much better in modern warfare"
External hard drive here I come. I really have no idea where my 1 and a half terabytes and f hard drive space have gone.
why???
You Cant share games owned on battlenet he would have to own it on his battlenet account.
You might want to look into how game sharing works through battlenet and PC. This could be one of those cases where only one account gets the license to play it and is allowed to sign in. The other account doesn't technically own it despite it being on the same system. Again thats just speculation. There could be a work around.
[deleted]
It doesn't give him option to even sign in to Modern warfare..
"I was testing stuff in a private match when this happened. It's a recruit level bot who has no starting mags. I'm not sure what caused this weird animation/lunge, but I have been able to replicate it once."

Not using sniper scope on K98?  Surprising
I use regular scopes so it doesn�t give my position away in the hills or on roofs
I usually don�t either. I�ll use a thermal hybrid on the Kar98 because it allows me to avoid being seen. Super effective but you lose a lot of range.

Shoot house experience
i feel so relieved i never have to headglitch there for longshots again since i recently got Damascus
"Lord i think i may have given some hardcore players ptsd. I was trying to get the AK gold, and had to get longshots. I had some friends helping me as well. They were on the entrances to junkyard and containers, and another one getting mounteds on the side of the wall looking at the stairs. I was just firing on whatever came onto my screen. I had 89 or so kills by the end of that shoot house game"
I know y'all probably getting camo challenges on shoothouse but damn it's funny just tossing a nade at around 45-50� from 50m away aimed at A/C flag and seeing a quad kill on my screen.
r/JustCODThings
"On the flip side of this, coming around the side when they're stacked like this is orgasmic."
Got a lot of 1911 headshots that way.
That�s when you equip a rocket and waste the entire group.
I usually run with an explosive crossbow because of better ads and fire speed. Also has the benefit of not having a huge signature on firing.
Me dying 3x here and still going back up to contest
Seeing your other 2 failed attempts lying dead on the ground? Been there too
"That's a perfect time to drop a JOKR on them.

Fun fact, you can fire a JOKR from the table on A flag but not from the table at C flag."
Learned that the hard way
"Fun fact: you can just aim the Jokr directly at C flag from A flag without standing on the table. Just jump up with it ADS while holding the fire button and it will lock on the C flag through the wall. Rapid swapping between normal and thermal vision to fire two shots faster, making sure those with EOD won�t get away in time. I�ve even hit headshots with sniper rifles without standing on the table, I just back off, ads, jump once to get the calculations, pull my crosshair down, jump again and kill them, pretty hard tho."
Is shoot house back?
No!
"The new 2vs2 Playlist also is realy funy and not that stressful, and you get a lot of kills in a shirt amount of time"
Unless he had a rytec with explosive ammo?
*Calling in a cruise missile*
That is why I pretty much never go on that lane unless an objective forces me to (think that open middle area is a hardpoint/headquarters objective?)
F
This is when RPGs are actually useful
"I had that on ground war, peaked out looked through my scope and saw 6 snipers looking at me"
My nightmare
\*MW2 Campers flashbacks\*
Shoot house do be like this
They look like Power Rangers
I'd be sweating
Yet people love shoot house for no apparent reason. 4 major choke points with the only flank route being running through the middle of what�s pictured here
hop down and start going ham with fmj
"Super true, especially why you swear you shot but you got killed right after"
I see four longshot headshot mounted kills
Wish I could actually play this game but it won�t recognize that I own it even though the disc is in the damn console
And this is why shoot house is poorly designed
"Yeah, he fucked up because he only had a rifle when he should of had a rocket launcher."
Get ready for trouble and make double

"CoD, the map is Shoot House"
Smoke then thermal MG
Dick move to your enemies and allies.
I hate when people do that
*laughs in cold blooded*
I can never hit my no scopes
i can�t hit
Try the SPR. I swear it has the best hip fire accuracy in the game.
You have no sc'ope in hell in hitting them
No scopes are a trick shot
In an MW2 search and destroy lobby you would get all sorts of abuse for saying this
Is there any difference between no scope and hip fire? Is no scope a term used for weapons you'd normally scope with like marksman rifles and sniper rifles? Honestly just curious.
Tell me you�re young without telling me you�re young
Youre the kid who wins the snipers only ffa on a no scope barrel stuff then acts good at the game
No this is kind poopy tbh.
"I dunno, I think a flying no-scope counts as a �trick shot�"
You think so? I wanted to do some weird shit like inspecting and reloading then a silent shot
"I did something like that on there, spun to see if anything would happen and I got a hitmarker. I wanted to die lol."
I feel your pain bro :(
"Trick shot or not, that was fucking clean"
Thanks :)))
Wow imagine that..a quickscope
"I hate anyone who uses an spr, mp7, or fennec unless theyre doing challenges."
Mouse and keyboard nothing more
Why I got a lot of these comments? If it's that powerful just plug any M&K and play with them
Sorry that you choose to play on an inferior control scheme
It's not like a mouse and keyboard is controlling the game with your mind or something lol. Takes the same amount of skill as a controller. It's just that M&K has a potential precision and speed advantage when going toe to toe with controllers.
"And a lot of people with controller uses modded ones, which is almost like a cheat since it can rapid fire and have almost aimbot like aim assist with those kind of controller, lets not mention not having to do the finger gymnastics that using a keyboard sometimes his."
"Indeed, 1 of 10 items are new for me, thats the fate of the older / longtime players."
All my daily challenge rewards are ones I already have from Season 2...
Yeah I had the same problem. Been getting the rewards for the last month now. I already have some of them but it�s nice to work towards something. Still want the little ghostie charm.
Still just 2 x Weapon XP tokens here for the last week.
You can get duplicate rewards but it seems like the chances to get something you don�t have are a lot higher.
mum get me camera
[deleted]
I didnt even expect it to hit lol the kid raged so hard my team and i were laughing our asses off
Congrats u hit the easiest spawn throwing knife in the game lol
Well arent you just a ray of sunshine
I did something similar by chance on tournament mode yesterday and I suspected myself of cheating.
lol
Thank you for showing me this new wall bang spot
You're welcome :)
Damn he flexed on ya
Juicy kill
Gotta love the Spr. Insanely accurate and busted damage. I hate that fuckin gun.
Considering the spr has broken aim assist that shot wasn�t impossible.
"Haven't gone back to that in the PS5 (but will surely, SSD space is as valuable as real estate these days, lol) but back in the PS4 Campaign was a must have if you want to play MP. If you can now uninstall that's great news."
"I might be mistaken then. Maybe the campaign was always installed, and even on PS5 it�s necessary to play MP..."
"And before any of yall cry 725 just know, they were talking trash and using shotguns all game and I only pulled it out for overtime."
Why do people talk so much shit about that gun? Seen so many clips of it on here and just started using it last week and love it! Which one were you using with the red tracers? That shit was dope
I�m not about to talk trash: that was epic and fun to watch!  Got some skillz.
Thank u
Unmuted ha
Gotta let em kno what time it is
whatre the proper 725 attachments?
"I�ll probably regret telling you this lol, but this setup has the sawd off barrel and stock, tempus slim grip, choke, and sleight of hand"
Same experience here. I went 4-16 W/L on ground war the other day. I finished top 3 on my team in every match except one where I was goofing off. Even a pro squad can't compensate for a useless team that all sits on the first flag and doesnt even try to move. It's definitely SBMM because it's statistically impossible to get put on the losing team that often if it were truly random. They can lie all they want but ground war definitely has SBMM.
GW has no SBMM pls don�t listen to them
"There is sbmm in ground war. How do you even trust them, they literally straight up lied about it being in Warzone, when it obviously was"
"No offense dude but the only maps that can be one side stomps are promenade and riverside. All the other maps have plenty of flanking opportunities. You just gotta try to play the objective more.  Literally ground war is the only mode I play. Boneyard and International airport are my favorite maps cause of all the flanking routes you have available. But yeah without apcs it's super difficult to counter any huge team pushes. I get the shitty teammate matchmaking, nothing you can do about that."
"You can't win alone. Sometimes I lose HARD even when I'm going 40-10 and 6 captures, because the rest of my team thinks they're hot snipers and want to play like it's All Ghillied Up but in actuality they're the targets for the enemy team.

23 loses in a row is very hard to get statistically, regardless of OP's skill or playstyle."
"Skill Based Matchmaking. That�s it, plain and simple. Either adapt and try hard or DieTryin"
"lol I can�t wait for activision to fucking fall hard once an amazing game without SBMM actually competes with them. Only reason these dogshit cod games have any players, is because there�s no games out to compete with them."
Skill based matchmaking would actually balance the players.  What�s happening is people aren�t playing the objective and are trying to get kills over everything else.
"1. There's no SBMM in GW.
2. ""Either adapt or die"" that's the job of SBMM in the first place. If he dies over and over again he obviously needs to be placed in a lower bracket.

This comment is stupid."
Shadowbans are only temporary.. so you probably just have to wait it out unfortunately.
Fingers crossed!
my friend has been waiting over a month to get his account back. wish I could help m8
"There�s a good chance you�ll be outright banned. 

Activision support seems to have zero interest in clearing the account of reports for the duration that it was hacked. I�ve seen far too many people who�ve received their accounts back only to be permabanned days later. 

Classic case of the right hand not talking to the left. The cheat review team clearly aren�t being made aware of an account being compromised by the account support team."
It will be lifted in a week. Don't worry.
You were right!
Any update?
Seems to be fixed now :)
Same is happening to me!
"Triple kill, double collat"
That was the meta gun in warzone for a while..
Was just about to mention this
Warzone is whack i prefer normal multiplayer
i rarely see the m249. kinda strange considering how good it is
And also has a 60 round mag too
LOL fuck this game and the devs
LOL they remove my post automatically. What a joke
I have this problem on PS4 but with the multiplayer survival. I can�t play it though.
Delete and reinstall overnight. Easiest way to avoid an issue and it�s a good solution most of the time with glitches like this
Thank you for the suggestion but the bug has survived a reinstall.
"Breaking 25 kills on your way to a nuke & then dying. That shit hurt, and not physically."

I don�t know how you didn�t react more to that. I�d have stopped and started laughing at that.

[deleted]
it�s still a map in the playlists
Forever I only played hardcore. But since playing warzone back for months and months I will play core now. Which is weird
"I only play core for HDR and AX-50 camos (currently grinding), aside of that only hardcore. Core with SMGs feels like I am gently patting the enemy with bullets."
Why isn�t my penis up there? That�s what I play with the most....
"Core as no Shipment, Shoot House or Livestock separate now."
Always hardcore. Core is lame.
It seems to be only some walls and even then it�s sporadic.
Lol
Yet no one complains about how easy it is to get a UAV and how it gives the team a major advantage
"Exactly, I don�t need ppl red dot chasing the map like flies to spoiled food. 

In bocw, ghost is what they call (balanced), and with personal radars and the constant uav spam, they might as well enable the radar permanently lol"
"People used to complain about UAVs all the time, especially in old games where UAVs were only 3 kills and killstreaks looped. In Ghosts my entire playstyle was built around rushing UAVs up. I could usually call in 15 a game 

The thing is, you can destroy UAVs very easily so what's the point of complaining? Plus having people on map does speed the game up a bit so I'm I'm sure most people aren't against it"
"It really isn't that good. The idea of ghost is better than it actually is in practice 

In objective modes the spawns are fairly predictable. In something like hardpoint the guys defending the hardpoint already know what direction you're coming from, so being on UAV doesn't actually matter. 

Plus they can be shot down very easily, you can destroy a UAV within 5 seconds if you're outdoors when it's called in 

I'd say it's only a must have in one life modes, where sneaking around is a big part of the game. Especially Cyber Attack, where the bomb carrier has a permanent UAV if they use it. 

High alert is a better perk imo. Pointman and hard-line are good if getting killstreaks fast is a part of your playstyle. Restock I've never been much of a fan of, 25 seconds can be quite a long time in fast paced modes. Overkill is disgusting on headquarters, use an AR to get to the HQ then a shotgun to defend. 

And tbh when I play TDM I never run ghost and I use an unsilenced gun. Keeps the game going a bit faster haha"
Ghost should only hide you when you're moving...I know I wish I could run restock more often especially in solos
"All the red perks are pretty damn good.
Ghost, overkill, and restock are the three best perks in the game.

I feel like the blue ones are badly balanced. EOD is pretty much the only good one."
"You talking MP or warzone? For warzone agreed 100%, but MP has good blue perks. Quick fix is one of the best, double time is pretty useful for rushing."
For real! The red perks are INSANE and then then the blue and yellows are like... wtf this is a perk? I feel this way especially for the yellow ones.
"Use specialist. If you use hardline, you can have more red perks for a few kills."
FMJ + bang bang = no worries
"ghost is so strong, it should be a specialist only perk"
You might have software either running or dormant on your drive that is triggering the anticheat. It causes consistent crashes when it detects something it seems suspicious. Crash enough and it will also hand you an auto ban.
I thought about that and before I even open up battle net I close everything Exept for Geforce. The only thing that I could have throught would have triggerd something was riot's anti cheat which I took off my computer a week ago. But I have checked multiple times and it never has anything open.
Well done Lad

Your FPS and input lag will definitely be worse

Whaaaaa?
"The displayed rank vs what you can see has been glitched for a while now. And progression. They haven't responded to comments on it nor have they mentioned if or when a patch is coming. They might fix it but I wouldn't hold my breath. If you view your rank in the scoreboard during a game sometimes you'll notice it. And sometimes the game treats you like the unlocks are new and that you're a low level, only to reset it later. Its weird for sure."
Yeah have that too.  during game lobbies my rank doesn't match what I see in Barracks.  TBH  after reading on the Activision site about how good Prestige and new ranking was going to be I see nothing useful about it.  I just play my games ignore the dumb Season Pass awards since we don't  get them and all that rank/prestige crap.  I'm working on Damascus tho I always said I wouldn't but with Covid I play a LOT more now.
"Modern Warfare 's support is over

There's no option to disable progression because u don't like it

If u hate Progressing, play offline, no one's stopping you

Anyways the main support is for warzone, not cold war"
"That's not what I'm posting about.    So  here's an update, this is a glitch. I logged in and all of a sudden I'm a PFC  and I'm ranking up CW levels.  Now I've logged out and back in and NOW my rank is back to Commander I Level 55.  

So something is glitching in their integration changing me to a CW player then back to a MW player with my regular rank and Prestige for whatever the hell good that does me a MW player."
"You might be getting bottlenecked by the CPU if your GPU isn't hitting 100%. I wouldn't think a 3600x would do that but I guess it's possible. I used to have that issue in some games when I had a Ryzen 2600 + Vega 56. Now with a 3070 + 5600x I never do.

GPU near 100% = good using full power 

Anything else you don't want to hit 100%"
"I know that�s weird, I also would think that it doesn�t bottleneck"
"GPU at 100% - freezes and\\or stuttering, learn before you speak, never should you aim for GPU load, aim for a decent quality with spare resources for difficult scenes. In current case it might be low RAM speed, wrong PCI-e bus setup, slow HDD(with such specs i would be surprised if you didn't get yourself a SSD), low video memory and\\or wrong game config, try to lower texture quality setting and see if it changes anything, would be also useful to post your GPU specs and RAM specs (real ones, not those which your vendor put on a box)"
You need to go to the documents/modernwarfare/players/adv_options and then change the rendererworkercount to half of your threads. That must fix the issue.
I�m gonna try that later!
"That's not how that works. On a side note though, Travy93 said, you do have a slight cpu bottleneck and 3600mhz ram wouldnt hurt either."
I always read these in the middle of gunfights.
I was in a few matches before this technicolor dream puked on to my screen.
"Why would you think this has anything to do with ""Someone in the lobby.""?"
It's just the game bugging out. Exit and restart fixes it.
"That�s definitely something wrong on your end. May not be drivers though if this is the only game. I recall there being an issue like this early on in 2020 that affected certain people on pc, wasn�t universal. Was resolved eventually iirc."
Many of them are given full load outs and skins at game release. When Cold War came out I watched Swagg�s first stream and his teammates were talking about how nice it must to to have everything leveled up.
they have minions that play �off stream�. nick mercs basically confirm it. anytime their stream is offline they have employees grinding camos and shit. no cap
They get there editors and mods to grind for them. Super lame IMO
"You can fully level a gun in a couple hours of plunder with a weapon XP tokens.  


If you have a couple people to play with you do as many of the supply run contracts as you can and ignore everything else.   


They are also going to be online the minute something drops and they buy the entire battlepass (the big guys get them for free even if they don't tell you they do, in fact part of the marketing is to show streamers ""buying"" the entire pass which will convince others that it's normal and OK to spend $130 every season."
"$130? I spent $10 on season 1 of mw, got every single season after that for free"
"just how long do you think it takes to level a gun lol.

Plunder, nuketown / shipment, zombies... takes several hours max. And MW weapons straight up require like half the XP of CW weapons.

A 20 min Plunder with 2X token and 10-12 contracts gets you around 3 levels even from 45-55 for CW weapons, and much MUCH more for MW weapons or lower level weapons."
"These guys aren't streaming for 8 hours, content creating, editing, then spending another few hours playing off stream though"
"One thing I did notice is that timthetatman has dark matter right, but he got a kill with a Mac and it came up with �Gold unlocked� yet his Mac is literally dark matter (no shade either I watched him unlock multiple gold camo on bocw)"
"they're streamers.. it's their job to do that.. 

they're not casuals.. they showed up in public with some sort of skills and dedication.. otherwise why would they open a channels in the first place.."
"Yes they have people level them up off stream. Can�t say who does it, but I know of at least one for sure because the people leveling them up for the streamer has sent screenshots"
"Jesus christ man, these streamers sure like to have their cake and eat it as well. Aren't streamers supposed to play their own game and unlocked stuff, isn't that part of their job? What's the point of streaming if everything is already unlocked and at max level. They might as well stop playing and pass on the controller to who ever is grinding. Can't even be bother to play a game to get pay"
Celebrity has it's perks.   Hey get me a Ice latte now!
With extra sugar please.
They stopped weapon levels and unlocks of it a few weeks ago
Yep
you can�t buy it and then download it at a later point in time?
"That's a good point, but I kinda have the urge to play it now lol"
"I�ve did something like this. When I wanted to play campaign, I simply didn�t installed multiplayer and anything else (except warzone, because Activision thinks that�s a Holy grail and you can�t even uncheck it in battle.net when you�re about to choose what product you want) that is available. When I�ve finished it I installed a multiplayer, everything in English language, because the game also weights less. Hope you�re able to do that, if your internet is pretty decent. ATM for me this game weights 148/149GB�s"
Hmmm that could also work. I'm in Australia so our Wi-Fi is really slow lol
"Using an external drive is totally ok. I actually run it well in a 3.5'' six years old WD hard drive (the game is optimized to run well on HDDs), so it should run well in an SSD, and it being external is not an issue"
I ended up removing 3 games I don't play and installing it on my internal HDD
"Rip, I have a clip on Sawmill where I was using the uzi and shot through the top barn wall, got 25ish hitmarkers, WITH FMJ ON!!! No idea how strong that wood is or if it�s supernatural but damn."
I always thought fmj did no extra damage to people just to killstreaks
I believe it. 4-5 times I�ve taken out snipers through wood with an SMG and it took 12-14 shots to kill them but their reaction was priceless lol.
Bullets do less damage at in angle when going through walls. Damage per shot can go as low as 4(as far as I�m aware).
How tf do you know this
"Look at the lower left of the screen just as you shoot through the wall, the three packet symbol comes up only while you're shooting implying connection issue server side or on your side. Either way it was the cause of the shots not killing him or not registering."
"It's a packet burst not packet loss, nonetheless it's not the issue at hand. I've posted other clips on this sub about how broken bulletpen is, this is just the latest clip of it. Weapons deal very inconsistent damage when penetrating virtually identical surfaces. Thin sheets of aluminum are impervious to bullets while I can spray magazines through a foot of concrete. FMJ doesn't work and frankly all it does is hell shelter headglitchers and campers imho. I only posted the clip to highlight another example of horrible inconsistency."
"Only two explanation I can think of is you were shooting through 2 walls (the one you're shooting at and the one that would be on the enemies left hand side) and that they were all limb shots.


You were shooting through 3 ""walls"" the two I mention before and the little box plant thing in the small court yard and that they were all limb shots.

Not entirely impossible. I used a Amax, FMJ, snapshot combo on the map once in a while and got 6, 7, 8+ hitmarkers with no kill and that's with FMJ. Probably because they were mostly limb shots.

Not hard to believe that a Asval with no FMJ would get that many hitmarkers. Also got take into account this is a ""concrete/stone"" wall not the paper thin playwood on A bombsite Hardhat or Shanty town Shoothouse."
"AS VAL is loaded with subsonic anyway so that wouldn't carry a whole lot of power through a wall, compared to supersonic ammo anyway"
"Wallbangs are the most random shit ever imo. The only wallbangs that are consistent, are from the 1shot headshot guns getting a wallbang headshot"
as val n 725? the enemies toxic or sumn?
"Fire shotguns and m4s, I'd had enough for the evening"
You explained it in the first word of the title
"CW sniping just has a really janky and weird sniper ads animation. Just feels weird. Getting kills with them is still satisfying, but not as much."

"i understand what you are saying but you have to remember, that warzone is free to play so off curse they will love to sell you a full game so you could unlock gold ,diamond, etc. and also they are challenges that are harder in warzone like the launchers they ask you to do 2 kills without dying in cw but 3 in wz and also you have plunder but I guess challengers or something like the paint cans in blackout or even direct buy are good alternatives."
[deleted]
I have Damascus and after that grind I was rlly hoping CWs was gonna be like old normal cod just get 100 headshots but I was wrong they stuck with MWs shit system. I got Dark Aether instead but I can�t even use it in WZ which sucks... anyways tho yes I would like different challenges for guns in WZ
"it's not you, I have great Internet speed but not in the game. FPS is often in the 40's but if I run speedtrest I'm cranking up to 45mbps (my AT&T is maxxed at 50mbps).  So it's not slow internet, I'm on my gaming rig that crushes any game."
I also have these issues. Consistent latency problems. I've tried switching to other multiplayer games and I have perfect connection when I switch so it has to be Activision's bunk ass servers.
People should start adding platform and gpu next to their questions.
You playing on PC or console? Wired or wireless?
"PC, wireless."
"Not just you, my internet speed is 150 mbps and I still lag in MW. It's nothing major, like usually my character will teleport a couple feet and sometimes my gun will continue shooting even after I let go of the trigger. I play other games and I don't lag at all, I only lag on mw."
The same thing happens to me! Sometimes I'll continue shooting when I let go of the trigger.
"It�s probably just you, my connections have been fine even when I�m using my phone hotspot, check if your wifi is slow"
Test your internet speed by the console or tower
"Skidrow was my favourite map in mw2, absolute most fun place to play when you ran a tac knife set up, only problem was the buildings covered most areas but that also helped if the enemy had any air support"
"Skid row is a good one! Although, not necessarily underrated, but Wasteland was my favourite mw2 map."
I remember sitting on the stairs with my m4 with FMJ trying to get extended mags. I loved that map.
Arkaden from MW3
Arkaden and Underground were great maps! Loved playing infected on underground and sea town.
Great map
"Modern Warfare - Karachi, Favela, Overgrown, Crossfire / BlackOps - Hanoi, Kowloon, Villa"
"Favela was a great map if you could get around campers, but definitely a good one."
"Oh Villa was a fantastic map. Can�t agree with you about Kowloon though, it always did my head in!"
"Grid was my first thought on black ops. Bit biased because it's the first map I played in BO1, but I always thought it was great 

Karachi is a great one from MW2 that I never see mentioned. It doesn't have an iconic look like the more memorable maps (terminal, estate, Wasteland, sub base, etc) but it's a great map nonetheless. 

For MW I'd say St Petrograd is underrated af. I genuinely think it's a fantastic map, both visually and design wise. Perfect for hardpoint, domination and TDM. It's 3 lane but isn't completely mindless"
Warhawk was my favorite map in Ghosts. Capping the B flag in domination always resulted in an intense firefight as it was in the middle of the street.
I didn�t play much Ghosts but Warhawk I remember was quite good. Although Octane is the stand out map from Ghosts for me.
Kowloon
Mission from MW3
District from MW1
"Upheaval from WaW, Lockdown and Mission from MW3, Sovereign from Ghosts, Detroit from AW, London Docks and Gibraltar from WWII."
"Yup same. Dev error. Every second round, ive been booted out of the tournament. Happened 4 different times now."
"Happened to me 3 times today. Even went and did some errands for a few hours, jumped back on and the same still. 

I doubt it�ll be fixed until earliest tomorrow morning if not until the weekend is over."
maaaaaaaaaaan that legendary blueprint i really wanted it fuck me 10 times
"Same there has been multiple posts and comments on this so not just a few people getting the problem, it seems it is broken this week. Very irritating"
Yeah this is a high-budget triple A game people.
"Same here, after the first game I can never get into the second one without the game crashing"
At least I�m not the only one.  3 times so far.
"Render resolution should always be 100, and screen resolution should match your monitor resolution"
\^This.
"In my experience, trying to lower the game to 1080p when on a 4k tv/monitor will harbor these results."
Solution from activision: �you could always buy Cold War�
"No, sorry. Unless for some reason support wants to not be assholes or even respond to you.

Out of curiosity, whats the new name?"
It�s literally I Y I. I gotta wait 6 months to change this bs that freakin sucks. At least I have my account
"Hey pal, my buddy told me yesterday that apparently on the 15th or something like that everyone will be allowed to change their names again. Resetting the whole thing I believe. So just make do until then. 

On another note if I were you I�d change all your passwords for anything and everything that connects to that account to fully secure it. Kids are weird these days."
Did you have 2fa
I did 2fa and downloaded the authenticator so I�m good now. Hopefully they give out name change tokens again soon
How do you change your name?i remember finding that option but don�t remember using it since is still the same name as my psn account
Monday I believe for a new token
Im confused

"The XBOX gamer tag, or the battle.net gamer tag are not the same as the Activision in game name. 

So it's normal that they're different."
Ok thanks
My Activision name is completely different from my xbox gamertag and I assure you I am terrible and also have no idea how to cheat lol
Thanks for the info
Pretty much everyone has a different activison name than their psn or xbl gamertag. You can change it in the account settings or on the website. What makes you think that means they're cheating?
"I�m just old and didn�t know that was a thing lol 
But, the person�s pistol always shoots like a machine gun ( and it�s not a renetti) and their FAL also always shoots like a machine gun ( not burst perk)  and they always use a pistol/ fal  combo so i assume it�s a modded controller or something"
No sound :/
Lol

Try pressing F10. By default it mutes game audio.
People who have never gotten a nuke gonna hate. Gj m8
I've tried but then I realized I'm not good at the game lol. I have crippling depression
Life has been stressful and I haven�t played in 6 months. This clip has me genuinely wanting to get back to it
How would it be less impressive on hard core
"""Because everyone has less health and dies in one shot so it's easier to get kills"" 

Fails to realize that op can also die in shot as well."
"I have one nuke... in HC... on Shipment... 

HC is a different animal and some people just don't get it."
"I've never got that, considering that you can die to an awkward stare in Hardcore, keeping a streak is so much harder. Once I got used to HC though I definitely didn't want to go back to core."
"If people don't have mini map dots and have a fraction of the HP as long as you jump others youll win most times. It's really more about who jumps who, in normal you can counter shoot someone if you're quick enough. Removing kill cams also helps massively if you camp."
Only seven year olds think this
"Advanced movement is less advantageous in HC. In Core you have to master movement and how to counter it. I'm HC you can camp a heady as even if you don't have great aim, you only need like a single bullet to kill a bunnyhopper."
No clue. Hardcore is harder and easier in its own ways. Core and hardcore both have campers. That�s like saying BLOPS 3 didn�t have campers or modern warfare 3 didn�t have them. I just think hardcore is mainly about reaction time and flanking. And ofc the occasional posting up in a spot to get those triples
"Can someone explain to me (who hasn�t played mw) why this is cool? People got nukes pretty frequently in MW2, is it extra hard and super rare or something in this game?"
"If you really don't think HC has a smaller skill gap than the already tiny one in this game, you're probably not a very good player."
"MW finished at Season 6. Only rumours about season 7 of MW.  


Season 2 is Cold War."
[deleted]
"Sorry man, but it was never official only rumors"
"It sucks but there had been some ""reliable""  leakers saying we'd have some content but nothing so far."
It's rust they forgot a string of code that would load the map resulting in the crash I heard
Same for Shipment.
damn alr
FYI the tournament is working now.
thanks
having the same problem twice now
same it crashes every second round with me and my friend this has happened twice
Same it's happened 3 times now.
Also happened to me twice. On both consoles (PS5 and PS4 Pro).
"Someone predicted March 11. Boy, were they wrong."
Nah
This is probably false but I heard someone on twitter say it was delayed because they switched giving the automatic slide to the x16 and needed to compensate the sykov by giving it something cool.
"I will never understand why the game didn't ship with the x16 having a auto slide lol like how are you going to have a glock, make it arguable the second worst pistol in the game, and not give it full auto. I main pistols (and shotguns) and that always just blew my mind. But for real, I hope we get the new guns soon because this is really starting to irritate me"
"Nooooo my stechkin :(

i hope it's false, or at least should've given the full auto slide to both guns probably"
"I hope you�re right, would be nice to have MW weapons back in the meta, instead of the CW AUG lasering you from half the map away or the MAC10 and FFAR dominating close range."
"Well thank you for the insight, I was under the assumption that this was just Activision fucking us over to boost sales for cold war. I'm honestly starting to lose hope that'll we'll ever actually get those guns and I've been waiting for a full auto pistol since mw launched. We finally get one and its just a big fuckin tease. I don't remember a delay for seasons 1 and 2 but I do remember the delay for season 4, I'm assuming they were behind schedule for some stuff so they delayed it, I just though it was dumb they said the reason was they don't want to release stuff because of blm. Just admit that it wasn't ready lol who knows though, I could be wrong about that too"
My guess is when they nerf the ffar and aug they will release these guns and they will be the new meta in warzone and everyone will buy the bundles with the guns.
I think you're 100% right.
"I think they�re just not going to be included because it would potentially draw attention away from Cold War. Unfortunately, activison doesn�t have any responsibility towards us as players they have one towards their investors."
Nah. They'll release it in summer to milk last drops of cash possible from the title prior releasing new title. It won't be Cinematic or spectacular.
I haven't seen the serac back yet but I hope your theory comes true
Apparently it's back in plunder
Does anyone know if the raal mg is still available through weapon drops in public MP?
"Honestly I expect the content to be released to hype up MW2022 at this point. I was hopeful for season 2 release but now I've kinda given up

Oh well, there's more than enough content in MW I guess"
Hold on... Soap is not going to be in the BP?
Content that�s finished and in the games files will come to the game? Wow what a shocker! I would have never guessed.
That�s not really guaranteed. Prop hunt game mode and audio files have been in the game for some time. I doubt they�re releasing that. Not everything thats datamined is meant for release.
"I have a 10700K and RX 480 8GB. This has been happening regularly in both Warzone and MP. I'll play for about 20 min and then halfway through a match the traffic cones and windows decide to go super saiyan. The problem persists until I restart the game and then it comes back after another few minutes. I've tried reinstalling the shaders and toggling SSR, no change. Naturally, I don't have RTX on. Please advise"
I've only had this happen maybe 3 times ever. It's annoying but exiting the game fixes it.
"servers are being weird, a lot of peopel in my last ground war match had issues"
"Yes! I kept on freezing like I was disconnected, but then everything would settle down."
Hope they get it sorted fast. I imagine servers are gonna start crashing soon.
So weird lol.... against bots and it�s still doing that
Yeah ive got no idea what's going on
"Cant even get into a lobby, like nobody is playing or something wtf."
This is why no one pays for Google Cloud
Help
Looks like an Origin Blueprint. I can see the horizontal side grip
Def a Origin Shotgun Blueprint.
"Nvm, it's The Duke: [https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/475-the-duke](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/475-the-duke)"
It�s an AR maybe grau or kilo
I want to know what the blueprint is. I can't quite tell what it looks like/is for.
"Same, can�t find anything on YouTube about it."
Thinking it's this [https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/159-stealth-action](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/159-stealth-action)

"Whoever makes these tourney schedules needs to be slapped. I literally have to check in on random days of the week to make sure there isn�t a new tourney out. The tournaments don�t even last seven days. I think this is the fourth blueprint since the return of gunfight, right (Famas, Mg34, mk2 carbine, origin 12)?"
"They start on Fridays and extend to Monday morning.  Yes, that list seems right."
Do these blueprints ever return?

"I used to get that all the time on my xbox one and i would have to quit the game, restart the xbox, switch from my 5ghz to 2.4ghz internet, and then manually switch to online from local in game. Not sure if it would help on a pc but might be worth a try. I never saw much about it besides my experience for anyone else"
How would I switch from local to online in game? Would that maybe require having the campaign downloaded?
Some of the modes are longer which has made getting nukes in 6v6 easier.  But yeah b/c the way people play them and the maps they're on there's a lot more incentive to hold corners and not move from their designated camp grounds.  I have been getting few rust maps which haven't gotten in a long time so at least that's been refreshing.
"Nah it's trash tried it once and left before the game ended I just play dom and hardpoint now it's booty. All imma say, Cold War has had Nuketown 24/7 for months now..."
"After trying to play the tournament three different times and getting the same error after winning and loading into the second map I Googled how to fix it and the very next tournaments I won after winning the first round because the other people participating in the tournament still had not encountered it or tried to fix it



It happened to me every time I assume the map selection was either shipment or rust and I feel more Justified thinking that that was the reason looking over the tournament bracket and seeing when peoples games crashed.


I fixed it by going in to my Graphics settings, going down to the Shadow and lighting subsection and disabling Cashe Spot Shadow and Cashe Sun Shadows. 



I started to slowly see this happen after we won our first game very quickly and was hoping that this might happen and it took about 5 minutes to get through the whole tournament! Hope if anyone else was encountering this bug it helps"
"Got his ass. You had the decency to give warning shots, that guy that ran up behind you had no respect. You sir are a noble man and godly sniper."
I love this comment
Just like in Training Day
My aim at 3am when I should've headed to bed 4 hours ago
It�s my normal aim with snipers lol I�m bad
And then I still yell out �fucking LAG�
***ONE SHOT ONE KILL***
I know that was soo cool! Good job op!
Somebody give this man a Purple Heart.
Same here dude played it 3 times after the first match get this error every time
Yes I have played 10 tourneys today and each one after the first one says I cant connect to the lobby and cancels it. And have gotten the same title on the map too
Had same issue here. Tried loading back in but showed tournament matchmaking starts in 0.00 seconds. So I can't rejoin and it sucks because I was feeling pretty good about how far we could go down the bracket.
I keep getting JOCKWORTH error code in the tournament idk what�s happening :/
Search new. Several topics on this.
"After trying to play the tournament three different times and getting the same error after winning and loading into the second map I Googled how to fix it and the very next tournaments I won after winning the first round because the other people participating in the tournament still had not encountered it or tried to fix it.

mines already disabled and its still crashing
on Xbox getting this also
Bold of you to assume the casuals in here care about this lol
IW please...
"Never played it before, but if you know any cool clips I�d be down to make an edit"
Dopeeee
Ewwww league play in the worst comp cod ever no thanks
"Livestock also, small maps is where the fun is at"
This is what the people really want
"I think the playlist has value for warming up prior to hitting warzone as well! It�s the small, fast paced map that I have memorized so all I need to focus on is hitting my shots and centering. It�s a little more engaging than bots and much less annoying than plunder for that type of thing. The added camo grinding, XP, etc is just icing on the cake. But I think shoothouse/shipment (Shoot the ship) has a ton of community benefits. Along with the fact that nuke town 24/7 is constantly on and small map playlists are ALWAYS honored this way with treyarch games. I�m not even a fan of playing multiplayer and I still vote for this playlist to come back permanently. Just reduce Xp earned per match!"
Perfectly said my man! Although I do t agree with the last statement you made about XP because it�s literally always been like this lol). But none the less great take!
And 10v10 shipment
Guys only want one thing and it�s disgusting
Still not nearly as efficient as Deadpool.
What a dumb thing to be able to do.
Why is that
 nothing special in this just a broken gun
Stop whining
"nice flicks man.
i wish i had good aim on kb/m
i honestly just suck."
Are you in pc?
cheater... so obvious hack... try hide it better next time
I really hope you're joking
"I was about to say, that dudes aim is on point sarcastically"
"I love seeing people post clips and get hackusations.

Did they not see you fire a few shots directly into the ground from where you thought you saw someone?"
Whats your sens
Automatic
idk 23cm/360 or smth like that
Nice hacks

"you must be high, all my mouse movements match the ingame cam perfectly, give it another look and if you still cant see it either stop doing drugs or get a good pair of glasses."
It is very sus but there is a chance of delay with the webcam. It looks pretty cheap and the fps is fairly low so it's *possible* that he's just good at flicking
"yes, we controller players know the limits of kbm aiming just by watching mainstream streamers such as symfuhny am i right?!?! controller gang!!!"
Can somenoe please tell me how this adds up
no clue
I think there are prestige challenges.
"3 prestige�s pre season 1, 4 for season 1 itself, then unsure why you only have 2 for this season. Max prestiges you can earn per season is 4; 1 for every 50 levels you gain up to 200 and that�s when you get prestige master"
They might put in some bug in MW causing this just to force more people to buy shitty cOLd wAr
I�m in same boat. Finished season 1 prestige 6. Level 199 on season 2 I�m prestige 9. Level 200 I�m still prestige 9. What is going on with this?
"Good to know I'm not alone at least, we really need to get to the bottom with this. I love playing MW and WZ but I will not under any circumstances succumb to buying crappy CW"
It�s like fortnite every time it starts a new season you leave rank gets reset but the Prestige level you are at let�s say 257 will go all the way back to the nearest 50 then from there you�ll go from one to prestige and there�s one prestige level so if you were doing 250 per season you�re only going to get 2 every season
Then why did I get 7 prestiges in season 1? With that logic people would only get two prestige each season which doesnt make any sense. Im so close to uninstalling this shit for good
I think that's the max but idk tbh there might be a prestige 10
Prestige 11 is the max this season
"I don�t consider MW dead, for the simple fact that most people I know who�ve played both MW and Cold War prefer MW in almost every aspect. I still agree"
I understand
"It's not dead but MW/WZ/CW all feel EXTREMELY stale. 

I have been mainly playing WZ and I'm already level 150 prestige 9 (10 according to CW) and BP is Tier 92 (no tier purchase). 

S&D is basically the same thing and the large maps in MW do not help at all. I just wished MW/WZ had more variety to it- don't know if I'm explaining myself?

The fact that it's three perks and *that is it* is absurd. They could've added more perks and counter-parts to others like Overkill - Underkill - Shrapnel but for Stuns or simply the wildcard system from CW."
"Modern Warfare Multiplayer is dead?
If that�s true, that saddens me."
"with cold war, I would think so

edit: I understand your point of view now"
the AUAV is a UCAV stealth drone. I believe the one in the game is the X47B
"MW ain�t dead just this Reddit full of wallys, is everyone too young in here to remember a time where games got no dlc EVER and you played a game because you liked it lol"
"The game is the dead in the eyes of the publisher since they haven�t released any new content for MW lately.

But the community is still very active IMO."
"YOOO, I feel this pain in my soul. They got all kinds of funky shit going on... cracking 3 armors off a guy who just spawned in, then aug bursting him an additional 4 times from 5ft away & he still not down lol"
"You had less armor, but yeah wtf. It should have taken him 3 hits. He broke your armor on the first, then downed you with one more. With no plates and full health it should take 2 whacks

Its 2 whacks in multiplayer, but maybe warzone is different

Edit: and nevermind he had 2 plates just like you, damn"
No we landed from gulag at the same time both had the same amount
Yeah that does need to be fixed you are pretty much forced to melee in close quarters because guns don't do enough damage compared to fists/knifes.
"Yes, I deleted it.

Now just play conan exiles and BF4."
"Is conan exiles good? I got it from ps plus a loong time ago, but never played it. Isn't it kina like rust or ark?"
"Yep, after season 4 things started getting weird with hit reg, visibility, major changes to dynamic aim assist, ping spikes only when engaging an enemy, etc. Currently looking for a different game."
"Same issues with Overwatch too, it's because they signed a ""multi-year agreement"" with Google Cloud

Means there won't be any good Activision or Blizzard games for however long ""multi-year"" is"
"Yep!

I�m playing Nioh 2+DLC�s. After that, I will taste more ""pleasure"" with DS3."
"Unfortunately yeah, I used to love the game and I was part of the few that could look past a couple Of the issues latley but man I'm just getting tired of it now. Every game I've played latley feels like it's harder, I use to be decent but now it's like every match is with try hards. 

I joined late and so I'm also still trying to level up some of the not so good guns and it's not even fun because I get outgunned so easily, 

I've also noticed camping is way worse all of a sudden now too, I never had this much of a problem with campers but now every match I play is usually a camp fest or I end up having a brain dead team that ignores the objectives."
"Glad to see I'm not the only one who's realized this game has been getting harder, I honestly feel like SBMM has been cranked up again."
"I agree entirely. I only started playing MW2019 during season 6 so I was extremely late to the party, but I'm glad I finally got the game. The campaign is still a ridiculous call of duty campaign, but it was more of an action movie kind of ridiculous than previous call of duty levels of ridiculous. I really enjoyed it, the visuals, gameplay, story, it was all surprisingly strong 

The multiplayer is just plain fun, the customization is awesome and every gun feels viable to an extent, warzone with the boys is giving me memories of playing PUBG back in 2017 during the height of its popularity. Warzone is definitely a better BR experience than PUBG is now, and I can see myself playing it for some time.

And as cold war came out while I was just diving in to MW2019, naturally I was curious since the last COD I played prior to this was MW3. Looking at gameplay, Cold War just looks blander, stiffer, and less polished. The reload animations are just plain bad for the most part, the way the camera falls to the ground when you die detached from your body just looks like an early access game's death camera, the font they use for getting kills and objectives looks like it came from fortnite, and the sound effects are just bad. 

Whatever infinity ward's next game is, hopefully they can manage to capture lighting in a bottle twice in a row. Making an adequate sequel to a very popular and innovative game is difficult, but hey they did it back in 2009"
Same time I started playing
"Season 6 was when I started playing multiplayer, and it was one of the best multiplayer experiences I coul ever have"
Totally agree.
"I find it funny when people complain about this game being abandoned as if the Call of Duty series hasn�t been doing yearly releases since 2005. If anything, meshing the two games together into Warzone is the most they�ve done to lend support to a previous game. Either way I think both games definitely have their differences, but I love them both"
"Thanks for letting me know it�s on sale. I switched to PC and haven�t bought it on there, wish it was cheaper than $45 but I might still grab it again."
"Show both CW and MW to someone ignorant of the Modern Warfare series and ask them which game came out after the other and which one is being neglected to boost the other ?  


I am sure most people would think that CW is several years older than MW as it feels dated and rushed."
You know CW was always planned to be integrated into WZ right? Between March 11th and mid April we should have a new WZ map. Be prepared for it to transfer from MW/WZ to CW/WZ. That might mean WZ will have CW mechanics. So that also might mean we will have wild cards in WZ. Imagine a MW gun with 8 attachments on it. Then when COD 2021 releases it will slowly transfers from CW/WZ to COD2021/WZ and in 2022 we should have a new WZ map from the new COD. Verdansk from the base game of MW ground war and Co-Op maps. WZ CH 2 map should be based off of fireteam and zombies maps. I�m not saying the mechanics will change but it makes sense if it does. Brace for shock if you do not like CW...
"Tbh, I think CW is still in beta. No major difference between the alpha and its current state"
"It�s cool if you like and enjoy the game for what it is worth and appreciate it, but these �MW Good, CW bad..� posts are honestly just old and annoying. Did I have to click on this post? No... but every other few posts I see are people essentially saying the same thing. We get it, you enjoy MW more than CW, that doesn�t mean to constantly bash on the game, as if you want to do that, I�m sure they have a dedicated channel for it. I go on here to view funny clips or posts related to MW, maybe Warzone, not �How/Why CW ruined MW..� type posts. 

I�ve grown and got out the COD cycle long ago. I don�t mind a game here and there on it, but COD, like life when years pass on, simply aren�t the same anymore. I and maybe about 70% of the people that bought COD MW�19 probably bought the game mainly for the title and the fan service that it delivered. Was it successful in that? Yes.. Can it be fun? Yes.. Will I say that it is a game for me and see myself playing on a consistent daily-ish basis? Prob not, but I can see why the game is appealing to people. The last COD game that was pretty much when it was still in its greatest days were BO2. No doubt that was a time in which you can easily have all your friends on and run party modes, custom games, etc... Nowadays, it�s a struggle to get people to play the same game as you as people have grown and standards changed, for the better or worse. Even w the success of MW�19, the higher ups wanting their pockets filled, say it with me, do not care, how you feel about the any of the games as they know you will be playing or buying them anyway, whether you invested any kind of time or money into the games, you are doing them the favor. 

Besides, half the people speaking poorly of CW don�t understand or take into consideration the circumstances each of the games went through during their phase in being made. One was before Lockdown effects to place while the other was during it. The style of each of the Devs of Infinity Ward & Treyarch are much different as well. I don�t wanna go to the whole spiel of things because not only is it long, but ppl will prob just call me a fanboy of the game when in all honesty, i�m looking at things from all perspectives & don�t care that much of COD as one would if this was 2009 or 2010 with MW2 or BO1. & also knowing people of Reddit within this channel, speaking of something not being as well as they think it is in MW is subject to downvoting and crucification because they think MW is the best thing to ever happen, which is fine. When half of the ppl are blindly following like sheep and are quick to defend the game without being able to hear a different opinion of it than �MW is good at...�, all hell breaks loose. 

MW is indeed a quality made game, but that doesn�t go without mentioning its faults. Perfect example is the Gunsmith customization.. Devs did a fair amount of research on current, older, and possible future weapon. But near half of the components of the weapons are missing something towards their real life counterparts or use ones inspired by different weapons that aren�t necessarily the weapons or parts people think they are.

tl;dr The posts of you speaking your mind and opinion is fine. You are entitled to it. To see posts on the Mw sub be filled with 60%+ of the titles being �MW Good, CW Bad� is getting old and I miss the days of ppl showing unique or funny clips of showing what goes on during their play of MW. These posts of shitting on CW just because ppl like Mw more for what it�s worth. are not only getting dragged out, but also are not original as they think. You and plenty of other people have said probably the exact same thing and regardless of how you care of the game or games, the jerk off higher ups got either your time played and/or money spent on the title(s). You can say �Well if we keep mentioning it, they�ll eventually have to change it, right?�... Let me counter that by asking you how fixing SBMM is going... people have been talking about it for the longest yet none of the Devs or Activision has yet to make a comment on it, especially on these most recent CODs"
" what they have done to fix the game.heck even make one was sort of amazing.but it should have been delayed in my opinion but they did not need to make the dmr Mac 10 hellscape(it's a joke just to clarify) we got or sbmm.in the covid situation,I think no one would be disappointed if the game was released in 2021.I played the game in those open access week and found the game to be a more fast paced and had fun but the recoil is abit weird"
"If people here agreed with you this wouldn�t be at the top.   

I feel you OP."
I had no idea they uninstalled them after an update. I had the Operator/Weapons pack installed. I like trying for 500+ meter snipes and distance rendering really helps. Ill have to hop back on now and check it out. Thanks!
"Yes mw is a great game i play multiplayer b everyday. But what i don't understand is why there are not more Countryflags callingcards. In stead of more countryflags for more competition they add callingcards that have absolutely no meaning. 

We are willing to pay for our Countryflag

Something doesn't add up here, chief."
exactly. now this subreddit is r/coldwarbadmwgood
"Ah yes!

Another CW bad MW good post...It's been a while since we had one of these. I was starting to get worried."
Yes awhile like a week
"I noticed in WZ shortly after the CW release that distant objects (buildings, trees, etc...)  rendered so poorly. Seemed like anything past 250 yards was really blocky and this is on the Series X. Also get those useless zombies out of WZ!!"
Do you have the data packs installed? The high resolution textures were removed by default at about this time and were made optional through data packs.
"No one fucking cares bro, we understand that you are trying to get upvotes but no one cares this is an MW sub not a fucking cold war hate sub people like you ruined this sub ""get that CW garbage out of verdansk"" let's talk about the only good things that happened to warzone in MW's lifetime. The stadium opened up and we got a subway that no one uses and a train... WHEN COLD WAR got integrated we got a whole new map and mode for warzone and even better poi's and more weapons. Everyone was saying how stale warzone was getting and most people love the integration no one gives a fuck if the game isn't about realism anymore it shouldn't have been in the first place. Fucking twat and if activision only worked with infinity ward they would have to release games every year and then you guys would cry about the game being rushed. My god, you are so fucking braindead and stupid"

"Imma be real I�ve had these issues on MW since after season one, but it wasn�t actually doing anything the packet bursts or whatever, in more recent times they definitely have been for me however."
"Yea sound similar, always an issue but would come and go. Recently been persistent though and the packet burst is really noticeable, insta dying"
I�m from uk and the only problem I had was rubberbanding once on shoot the ship like a month ago
UK servers are pretty good for the most part. I've had issues when connected to Europe but it's reasonably rare.
"Yeah huge lag spiked games with like 700 ping spikes, jumping across map etc. Happens like every other day but only for a few games. Restart of my console normally does the trick for some reason"
"Yea been a regular issue for me and usually goes away, just has been so consistent last week or so no matter what I do. Ah well"
lol had my whole lobby die a few times yesterday while playing gunfight i thought somebody got mad xD
"I've always had a terrible connection, these days it's even worst but that's because of my internet, the other evening it lost entirely 40'000 packets in one evening, in 2021."

nothing is going to happen. stop playing for a week or 2 and it should go away. i�ve had it happen plenty of times
"thanks for the help man, do u know by any chance if it�s fine to create another account and use that? not buying the full game a third time obviously"

where the heck is the recoil?
"The build that I'm using doesn't have that much recoil to begin with, but I'm also on 120FOV on Affected which reduces almost all visual recoil.

You ever seen guys like Symfuhny and Huskerrs use guns and ask that same question? Those two settings are how.

Also, I'm used to higher recoil in other FPS games so COD recoil is easier for me to manage."
this shit looks like aimbot lol
I can see how someone can make that assumption from the first clip. The second clip where I switched targets you can see me undershoot it and correct it.
Aim looks pretty sus to me
"Honestly I thought these ones were pretty tame, but you're entitled to your own opinion."
Hell of a snap on that last kill.

can i get your Sens and Dpi? and also do you use mouse acceleration?
"Word of warning, my sensitivity is considered meme tier and I'm in the process of slowly lowering it.

Currently at 1800DPI, with an in game sensitivity of 6. I think I have a 12.8cm/360.

No mouse acceleration, pretty much because it's fast enough without it. As I lower it, I might play around with it. I'm trying to progressively lower it to around a 20cm/360."

"The ""Seasons"" are now only for CW and WZ. MW has to stand to the side with hands in pockets, kicking dirt looking sad now.  

or like saying silly MW player Seasons are only for current games now!  We stay loyal and hope for some DLC to come until the next rev."
There isn't any incentive for them to implement it. If you want to use the content from the black ops season 2 battlepass you'd need to buy black ops. They can't use the MW guns in Cold War.
"Because the games life cycle is over. Every past COD game had content and support mostly dropped after a year and the next game was heavily promoted. They're not adding CW/WZ guns because they already have your 60 bucks for MW. What they want is CW sales and WZ microtransactions through battle pass. Sure new free content would be great for MW, but that would mean implementing it into multiplayer in the first place. Which in turn would be like them saying they're still supporting it and then people would beg for updates, patches, and other stuff for MW which Activision doesn't want to do. Its sad but its always been this way. No point in being surprised now. The same thing will happen to CW this year around October when the name game is announced/released."
"Yeah I guess. I just thought things MIGHT be different this time, since the implementation of cross progression and linking the games. Just seems kinda wack that a free game gets free content, when a 60 bucks game can't just get those free stuff slapped on, since they both literally share a game."
"the one thing that is dumb is how you cant use the watches form cold war in modern warfare multiplayer, like you can use them in warzone and are fine on the modern warfare operators, but not in actual multiplayer"
"Can I just mention the fact that the m16 is not i MW? The m16 is the most icon gun from MW series like wtf, also the G36 is a variant hof the holger why???"
"Because since the M4 IRL is just an M16 with a short barrel they didn't make it two guns. Plus, it wouldn't make sense to have a gunsmith with the option to have custom barrels only to make a gun that looks identical to another one"
you can make an m16 through the gunsmith U
"Could you EVER use ANYTHING from Black Ops in Modern Warfare or vice versa? They alternate every year. Of course they could do it, Woods is literally in MW. But MW already has 40 operators with backstories and coalitions, it really doesn't need 40 more from the 80s."
"Idc about the operators, but not including the guns is kind of dumb. They could include the guns with a slightly different coat of paint and fit them to support the MW attachments.

But we have three guns *made* for MW that we don�t have yet so it�s not even worth getting upset about."
"I mean, I don't care too much about operators either, it was just an example of something that is very very easily implemented.

But yeah, totally agree."
"tbh i would get CW and download Warzone(Free), also if rumors are true MW2 is slated for this Oct/Nov"
I don�t play war zone but I was considering that because of the free multiplayer events
"I would tell yourself this: What do you prefer: Zombies, or Multiplayer? If you like the campaign in both, the only deciding factors here are Multiplayer and Zombies.

Personally, I feel like multiplayer has more replay value than zombies. However, zombies is more chill and less frustrating. If I were to pick, personally I would choose multiplayer, as outbreak is really the only zombies mode I like.

Modern warfare is past its update cycle now, so won't be getting any new content, whereas CW is still being updated - however, MW as it stands still has more content right now, cause it's been through its fill of updates. So, that's also something to consider I guess.

I'm not gonna tell you which one to get. That's up to you, but personally I prefer MW to CW. That's just my opinion, I know people who prefer Cold War."
"I�ve also put in a lot of progress into mw when I played on console, I had a lot of money used for operator packs and got Damascus, so I don�t want all that progress to go to waste"
This is the best comment I�ve read tonight.
"If you are playing MP MW is far better gameplay wise but it has kinda been abandoned by the devs because of warzone.

If zombies obviously cold war

If campaign I personally enjoyed MW campaign way more.

Mw coop is kinda dog"
cold war is horrible get mw if u plan on playing more multiplayer but buy cold war if u wanna play mostly zombies
Stop acting like mw isnt bad itself this game taught you how to play like a pussy
"If you want some thing more casual I'd say cold war. Thus sub is pretty much a circlejerk as of late so I doubt you will here anything other than buy mw. Everyone experiences with this game are different but it is much more sweaty imo.

I'd you really enjoy the warzone movement and stuff than grab mw but CW muilti is pretty similar, has better maps(to me at least), plus zombies(outbreak is also fun) and the devs seem to be a little more responsive about *some* issues"
Surely posting this in a modern warfare sub may mean your decision is swayed? I love them both but I find BOCW more satisfying to play and because obviously it�s the game that is the cod league is playing means watching it then playing it is more fun for me. That and activision threw mw into the fire the moment black ops came out
I posted this in this subreddit because the cw subreddit is filled with people that will get pissed if you don�t have the same opinion as them
If you�re on ps2 Barbie horse adventures is actually a decent game if you can get over the Barbie part
"Cold War is ass and you�ll only like it for about a week or two. Or until you torture yourself enough to get dark matter. 

So much hype because everyone thought it would be a black ops reboot but it turned out to be an arcadey mess full of bugs and trash development."

Thats parks voice from cold war. Cold war operator voice lines are in the files. People have posted adlers voice on here too
I don't think it's Park. I think this one has a different accent
"it's the random wz operator selector bug, whenever it carries over to mp as random your skin becomes wyatt even though the game randomly picked a cw operator."
Not a new operator. Just voice lines that glitch into MW from CW because they share files. Check the sub and you'll see its a common glitch. If you had captions turned on you could have seen which CW operator's voice it was.
I was playing on that map a couple of weeks back I have subs on and one of the lines was coming from a character named Vargas. CW messed up
It's someone using a CW op. I've been fooled by it. Another reason to hate CW.
Nah its just raven being garbage devs
I have subtitles on and I always hear stitch or alder for some reasons ?
"Hey, sorry this happened to you as well. Mine was hacked last month February 23. I submitted the account recovery request the same day. I also chatted with support a few times so I highly suggest doing that. Wait times are pretty ridiculous though (2-4 hours) and they�re only open 1-11pm PST. Give them your case number, explain your situation and just get them to look into it and tell you it�s being dealt with. Screenshot the conversations just for the record. 

If you have all necessary details like original Activision ID, email etc, give that info too. And if you have screenshots of in game purchases etc, ask the support agent for an in chat link so you can upload it and have it attached to your case. 

After about a week of waiting, I got an email saying �request could not be processed�... I was confused and upset so decided to chat with support again. Luckily this time the support agent was actually really nice and helpful. He walked me through the process of submitting the request again correctly. Mind you this was on March 5th. After this chat session, I got my account back on March 9th. 

All hope isn�t lost. Just try to follow those steps. If all else fails, file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I�ve seen some people get their accounts back that way too. And just as the other comment said, if the hacker takes liberties on your account and does dumb shit, there�s a chance your account will get permanently banned shortly after you get it back. But do mention this to a support agent in chat as I did, I told them if this were to happen, will the security enforcement department look into it and reserve the ban, I was told yes and I took a screenshot of that conversation. 

Good luck!"
"They have yes. Some people get it in a manner of days. Others wait weeks if it months. 

What has been taking place as well is people will get their accounts back and within a day or two will be banned for the actions that the hacker took while in control were they inclined to cheat. 

So even if you do get it back, there�s a chance you�ll be banned shortly thereafter. And Activision has a strict no debate policy on bans. So you can�t even contact them and tell them they banned a hacked account for something that was placed in the report queue while you weren�t in control."
"Based on some posts here, it can take weeks to get it back or it can take months. One guy took 6 months to get it back and, when he did, the account had been banned anyway because the person who originally stole it used cheats. Its a fucked up practice but sometimes if hackers know that the account will be taken back from them, they'll cheat blatantly to get it banned as a last fuck you. That's why you need to make sure you have 2FA enabled and change your password if you suspect anything weird."

I�m on wired and what seems to work for me is unplugging my Ethernet and connecting to the WiFi and joining on that. Then I replug my Ethernet in and everything�s fine. Not sure why it works or if it would for you guys though
So weird. We've got nothing to lose so I'll definitely give it a shot!
Fun fact: you can hip fire while doing *most* left hand animations!
i think i had heard this before so my natural reaction when i was calling in the UAV and he came around the corner was to just spray and pray. it worked out great if you ask me!
The animations in MW are perhaps one of the best I have seen in a FPS game. Shame this game has been 'killed off' in support of Cold War.
"Impeccable engine and animations, questionable map design. MW19 was so close to perfection"
I didn�t realise you can shoot while calling that in. Nice.
"Can also shoot while using stim, which can be very helpful. As mentioned above any left handed animations you can hip fire."
"i�ve been a very casual player until recently. my friend got me addicted to the grind of unlocking gold camos. so far i have the .50 GS, Renetti, and the .357 in gold. so now i�m working on the X16 which is what i�m using in this clip."
"I recommend getting the launchers done with before starting anything else, and melee, too. Riot shield for me wasn't so bad, I actually think knife was worse, but riot shield is fine if you go in like HC shipment or something"
*entire allegiance team: �noice!�
So uhh... camping is the new thing now? Oh wait it's an old thing!!!
Never expect anything from your teammates.
"Some people just have no honor.

Edit: thanks for 500 friends, may your kills not be stolen.

A massive double thank you for 800+"
Th only honourable thing to do if you kill a finishing movies blowing yourself up
Thats 90% of the people who play cod
Some people just wanna watch the world burn.
some people help make the world burn.
"The victim of a finisher should be invincible, change my mind"
I knew I wasn't the only one who wants this
If they are invincible they wouldn't die.
"Kind of an edge case, but you can cancel a teammate's finisher by killing the victim if you're getting pushed. Finishers seem like a great idea until you're locked in for 3-4 seconds surrounded by footsteps."
"I wonder why this still hasn�t been implemented? Either they want people to be annoyed, they�re lazy, or there�s a genuine reason why they can�t do it."
They should have a QuickTime event to reverse it like battlefield does
"The victim of a finisher should also be muted during the finisher. 

I hate how in Warzone someone can scream �HELP IM BEING ASSASSINATED�..... and there goes your.... assassination."
Lol I know how that feels
How dare he steal the kill and then get both of you killed in the process
"Lmfao u left that game so quick, I'd done the same thing too"
"It's a game!

I don't want to play a game with people who make the game less fun.  I leave shit all of the time."
I. FEEL. YOUR. PAIN. OH. MY. GOD
Some lieutenant Dan vibes on this one.
"Hell if I see a team mate who was just camping somewhere getting executed, sometimes I�ll watch them get executed out of respect for the enemy who was able to get it done"
"I�m usually that guy who is using the finishing move on the camper, so thank you.  

Most the time I don�t try finishing moves, but when using the shield if I hold the melee a fraction of a second too long it initiates.  But when I�m dealing with a true camper, it�s intentional because they�ve annoyed me enough that I�m hunting them."
"i try to save them. i don't like being the bitch who sprays and prays to kill him. i like going to them, defenseless, and execute them.

then shit like this happens"
Traitor
I respect that
"I saved someone with a finishing move in hardcore and my teammate came around the corner and killed me. 

Say what you will, but I went back and hunted him down and smacked the shit outta him."
I�ve had numerous times where teammates in HC kill me and the enemy just to steal the finisher away from me. Guess who gets a hefty roasting over the mic and killed by me and my party members Max amount of times afterwards?
It's so frustrating because it wasn't a panic thing he actively laid down to get under your riot shield and everything what a bum
that's what made me quit.
HeHe weed leaf ghillie go brrr
Hate hate when they do that.
right in the knee cap
man I love gunfight
Same! Definitely one of my favorite game modes  ever
"""I used to be a soldier like you, until I took a throwing knife to the knee"""
Bro I love that load out you got
"So much fun, I actually copied it for one of my custom load outs"
perfect
"High FPS with lag has to be a connection issue. Im not experiencing any lag myself. But it could be your region, connection type (wireless, etc), ISP, internet traffic at your home. Hard to say really."
"Curious about this too. Today has been really bad. I have all of the counters on and not seeing any issues with latency and packet loss. FPS is well over 100 but my game is super jittery.

Internet speed is fine but have rebooted router several times thinking was ISP. They have done some tests and seems fine to them so left me thinking it was MW."
I have 160-250FPS and the Player are jittery asf. What ever i set in option low to high ... Ping changes from Server to Server 17 - 33.
So is the lag
"\*Season six starts\*  
Me: Yo the VAL is so fkin OP

Reddit: No its a bug with the SPP rounds, when they fix it it will be fine

Me: Im talking about the normal VAL without SPP

Reddit: Lol youre dumb. The 30 round magazine and recoil make it balanced

Me: \*downvoted to hell\*

The VAL, 6 months later: still op af

Makes core feel like hardcore"
Lol yea the 30 rounds is crazy good they should have only done the 20.
"Me and my buddies play on PC, and we have come to the conclusion that the VAL is so incredibly good on PC that it makes every other gun obsolete, at least in multiplayer and not so much warzone 

It can kill just as fast or faster than the SMGs at close range, and faster than the M4 or AK at mid ranges, all while being suppressed 

The recoil is strong but it's nearly straight vertical, even more so with a commando grip. It makes controlling recoil incredibly easy, so you end up with a gun with an incredibly fast TTK at all ranges. I know recoil control is a thing on consoles as well, but its definitely easier on PC"
"It's wild on console as well. The 30 round mags make it the best rush class outside of maybe the vector (but not as good range). And the 10 round mags outpace all dmrs (I like the ebr 14 more and main that, but the val is my mobile dmr).

Needs a nerf but i doubt we get one."
"It really is, in hardcore it�s not even fair it shreds people"
Bro the core games be hard core with this gun.
"Even at ""range"" in Hardcore it's fucking awesome.  I'm only about 40ish games away from Obsidian and it's very rare I'm not getting the 15 kills per game.  

The mobility and ads of a SMG with the power of an AR.  Yes please!"
"HC needs to ban certain weapons or nerf the splash damage. It's not even fun when everybody starts RPG'ing and running a VAL. I'm trying to guild my crosbow here, damnit."
So annoying
I want this playlist back
It was surprisingly fun lol. Great for getting the no camo stuff. And not as rage inducing as shipment
I get melted by the Malphas *all the time* <sad face>
It's definitely meta
"In other news, water is wet."
What�s your setup for it?
In the vid it's literally no attachments lol. I was going for those camos. Normally I do a long range set up with 10 rounds. I'm an EBR 14 main and the 10 round val beats it in every way outside range.
"I use OSA Barrel, Tac laser, commando foregrip, 30 round mag, and sleight of hand. Although you could probably swap the slight of hand for the recoil controlling grip. 

EDIT: Strelok stock instead of the grip tape."
any weapon is as OP as the player that uses it skillfully
"Hahahahaha what?? This literally makes no sense? Are you trying to say that there is no objective difference between the power and usability of weapons?

You do know that when this game was being played professionally, the pros basically only used the MP5 and the M4? If �the gun is only as OP as the user� then couldn�t they have all just used their personal preference? No, because the mp5 and M4 were the best guns in the game at the time and they fucking shredded people. Guess what they found out? That if two people who are equally skilled are in a gunfight, the person with the better gun has a better chance of coming out on top. CRAZY, right? The degree to which the gun is better decides how OP it is based on how much it bends the otherwise equal gunfight in their favour.

The AS VAL has the fastest time to kill in the game by an incredibly large margin, that�s a fucking FACT. Anybody who thinks it�s not OP, especially in SnD where you hardly have to reload, is fucking faded."
Yea but the val is 2 much lol
Mine is doing the same on Xbox one except it crashes once a game is about to start
I need to learn how to throw knives like that I always miss my throws
"You really should. Start at a low sensitivity and keep your vertical lower than horizontal of that makes you comfortable. I used to do like 8 or 10 horizontal, and 6 vertical. But nowadays I do 17h/13v.

It also helps raising your dead zone if you play controller. Gives you more room to adjust aim. When you�re throwing and trying to hit someone far, compensate for the distance and velocity by aiming where you anticipate them to be, and aim a torso�s worth or more above their head depending on their distance.

I have 5.4K throwing knife kills, and don�t know what a grenade is unless one is getting thrown at me haha.

Edit: my bad, I have 5.7K throwing knife kills and my goal is to get over 9000 kills."
i think it should be put back out there because there are some people that have no friends and this game has made me friends i used to be so antsocail but now the people that i meet in this game has helped me realize something i should be more social.
I felt the same way but honestly after a few days you�ll get used to low fov again
"I play on PC, and I always have my FOV at 103. 

I defo prefer MW to CW, but CW is decent too. Defo played more MW since CW launched though"
I agree and I wish they would prioritize weapon balance. That way they could keep the game fresh just by buffing the guns no one uses. This would give the game more options without devs needing to create whole new guns.
"Exactly, there are guns ppl never use because the mag size. No one uses fenec neither when it's actually exactly like the mac10 but it has no speed reload also no 50 mag. They tried to kept the balance with it but now that there is no limits with cold war weapons they could buff some iw weapons at least in magazin or sth"
"I agree with the ammo stuff

The holger needs more barrels, neither increase damage range or help with recoil

The best scar barrel gets 38% range increase and only 10% recoil reduction, compare to Kilo which gets 45% range and -32% recoil"
the default holger barrel is basically a long barrel. the range is really long for default barrel so you dont need to use an attachment for a long barrel. i recommend using the monolithic supp for some more range and velocity and a commando foregrip for recoil reduction
"45 round scar would be insane, I wish they'd rework the .300 blackout rounds on the M13 I love the way that gun feels but it just takes too many shots to kill"
"I wish the SCAR in the game could carry .300 blackout. Would be a nice addition. 

I love the idea of different ammo types in gunsmith the most."
"Hooray! Another holger fan! I try using it as much as I can and would love some buffs (honestly mainly annoyed they didn't use the real dual optic scope since it looks dope) it's always a bit annoying that whenever I switch to a different gun I start getting more kills. Though never really have a problem running out of ammo, the bullets never seem to make it fast enough I think they underestimate 5.56 too much."
"Holger was my first Gold, before they put it in the trash."
SCAR with a long range build with the bipod grip is so much fun to use.
"Agree, once won a solo with bipod/range setup and it was fun, but 30 is still not enough. For solo it was fine in 1v1 but even in duo it's not enough sadly :/. I mean how would it be any competetive when ffar can kill you with 10 shot in the head if you have only 2 armor but with sonic speed. I really think they should buff the forgotten MW guns, I mean what could go wrong? Cold War already ruining everything that called meta, even if they put in dmg or just magazine or less recoil, that wouldn't change much"
Wait till it�s meta and people will complain about them
"I just have a feeling that these 2 weapon would become very much meta if they would get these changes. But probably will never happen. Anyway I will work for obsidian holger :'( at least that comforts me xd. My top2 wep on my list m4 and holger, m4 already obsidian with 8k+ kill :D time for holger after too much warzone  lately"
"I don�t think we�re getting any balancing to MW, at this point. Could be wrong."
"No one thought we could get new guns after cold war but we will (they are too late too), so why not"
I don't think you're wrong as activision won't let IW release three fully fleshed guns. Most we'll get is mw weapon rebalancing in warzone
"The issue is there is no large capacity mages for those guns that aren't already in the game. The G36C doesn't use STANAG mags and the SCAR only has up 30 in a straight double stack mag before you jump to drum mags which are much heavier than double/quad stackers and will affect your ADS times in the same way the 75rd drum does on the AK-47. 

Personally I think drum mags should have a reduction to recoil because of the added weight, almost like a built in operator foregrip but it's a bit late now asking for changes."
Are the 30 round holger mags realistic? They really don't look like it. The mag release almost looks like a stanag conversion too. At that point I don't think it would be that much a stretch to just make up a 60 rounder
I really like the holger but it's just so bad. The attachments needed to make it usable end up giving it so much instability that it has basically no long range capability even in semi auto.
"Before the integration I used holger much times in my fully auto slot, it's actually did pretty decent, but since cold war weapons it have even less chance in gunfights"
"I wouldn�t mind a 30 mag on the SCAR or Oden. The SCAR is fairly similar to the AK I find. And I see it used most often in HC Cyber and Search. I think the AK is the most popular in these game modes, followed by the Val. 

I don�t use the Holger so can�t really comment."
"Makes me miss the days of Wolfenstein Enemy Territory, when a company wasn't obsessed with the almighty dollar."
"Activision is notorious for keeping their game prices high for way too long. If I remember correctly, Black Ops 2 is still 59.99 on Steam when not on sale. I've only ever seen MW go on sale twice in the last six months, and never lower than $40."
"Look at old Activision titles. BO3-BO4, WW2, etc. Their prices are still high imo. They like to keep older titles expensive because they dont want people going back and focusing on old titles. If you want the nostalgia, you pay a premium. And if you want MW over CW for example, they want you to pay full price because they know you'll cave eventually and buy it if you like the game that much. That, and they're hoping to push you to buy CW or whatever the next game is at the time. They want you to ask yourself ""why should I spend 60 on a game that is getting no more content updates, when I could spend 60 on the new game thats got over half a year left and new content coming""."
*Inserts excuse*
"I always buy from eneba. Have a look there.

https://www.eneba.com/"
Because the game is good. Cold war is lame so they give discounts all the time also trying to hold up new mw contents on warzone so they won't go back to mw.
Make Holger meta? Eh piece of cake. Just make it aim at 300ms and you have a perfect hybird gun.
you commented on the wrong post bud
"It�s because the game still has a lot of perceived value. Full price isn�t as crazy as it seems when you consider how popular the game still is.

Instead of waiting it out for a sale I�d honestly just go for it. The game is worth $60 in my honest opinion."
You have to buy it again. You can�t just buy a bundle and then share it lmao
Maybe suck less
"Kudos for the good bait, downvote because argumentless opinion discarded"
"It's one reason I don't like 6v6 and always preferred 10v10 or more. With a larger number of people on the medium size maps, campers won't last for long. 

I miss the CoD4 days of being able to have 32+ players on any map in the game. It made for some [fun knifing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCiMKChDFBM)."
[deleted]
No mercy lol
"I might try Battlefield soon enough. Nevertheless, I'm not going to bother you with the git gud diet because camping is camping. No two ways about it. But honestly, while campers still frustrate me to no end, you can indeed find ways to work around them, specially if there's someone else in your party while playing the game. I don't think there's actually a single unassailable position in any of these maps. But I share your frustration. I even turned on every ounce of toxic masculinity yesterday bacause of one of those fuckers."
Let the hate flow through you
"Fr bro, the people that defend all of this camping shit piss me the fuck off. ""uSe tHIs pErK tO hAcK cLaYmOrEs nOOB!!!!!!!!"" Then I won't be able to all of the other perks in perk 3. Never buying an infinity ward game again unless it's an mw3 multiplayer remaster."
"Amen to that. Even in Warzone it is a problem, no matter how much people call it ""tactical gameplay"" IT IS NOT, is just CAMPING. You want the proof? The fact that out of three prek slots, in two of them YOU HAVE TO USE ALWAYS THE SAME TWO PERKS, Ghost and Cold Bloodeed, says it all. Not because you would need them, but since eveyone else camps and has them on, you are forced to have them on as well or you'll be at disadvantage from the start."
"I understand you, bro, I like this game but campers just pisses me off.  They should leave cranked playlist as permanent. Literally anti-camper mod, 100x times better then StS."
my Nvidia 1070... so far so good.
">	10 years ago, if you camped, both your team and enemy team would have called you a fa***t and you would have been vote-kicked out of the game. But nowadays you are the one kicked because of �offensive language�.

First they took away the racial slurs, now they are coming for the homophobic slurs! What�s next? How will assholes like yourself express themselves?

Are you actually processing the shit you write? My guess is you�re under 50 but somehow you sound like a racist grandpa who is upset he can�t use his favorite n-word anymore. All you have to do is exchange the slur."
"Wow , I was actually wondering when the first leftist snowflake would take this personally. For the last time, once and for all, that term has never been used in the entire franchise's history with a homophobic intent. I bet you already reported me for hate speech, didn't you? You're so pathetic."
"Sounds like you have software that�s triggering the anticheat. It�s either something dormant in your hard drive (modding tools, cheat engine) or you have something running in the background. Graphic card overlays. Temp monitoring overlays. Gaming mice/keyboard software. Etc."
How you know so much?
"No, buy Cold war and fuck you

- activision, probably"
Literally lol. Choke out a great game for the benefit of the one no one likes.
"imagine releasing good guns on mw and even the zombies who bought Cold War because it had several countdown go back on MW just to farm out those weapons XD. Pretty sure that's the reason, I mean they are literally completed gun 3 month ago..."
"Wait, it's back in WZ?"
Ye bro
It's like give chachaut but in CoD
Oh god. It really is.
Yea I got 14 kills with it one time so.... yes plz
Melts whatever this setup is melts faster than the FFAR up close and it beams.
"everyone wants it so please give it, that's the way it should work"
Wait how are there zombies in prison I thought they only spawned at the shipwreck?
"For some reason they changed the location of the zombie spawns to prison only a day ago, something to do with the story idk"
Asking the real questions here
Why the fuck did I think this was coop
I misread the title and thought the gun was finally out... pls Activision
Wtf I thought they removed the new guns from the loot pool in wz
Wasnt this and the pistol supposed to be released near the end of season 6?
I just dont understand why they dont release the new guns in mw
"�Nah fam, cop our game straight outta 2013; Cold War� - Activision, definitely"
but the CX9 was released in 2006...
they just gonna nerf it anyways cause people cry like babies about guns being too overpowered
It makes the game boring when people sit in corners with heartbeat sensors and Mac 10s
It's just a little worse mac10 man..
MW noobs be downvoting like crazy lmaoooo
Well done!
I know that jigsaw feels bad...
How did that last guy not kill you?
Who knows!

"I did gold launchers in free for all, there was just personal radars everywhere... worked a treat"
"Yup I did the killstreaks in free for all first. I�m just struggling to get the Defender and Attacker kills now since on some maps, the objective is in an enclosed building so there would be no way the JOKR rocket can get through."
"I kept my work after sts, and I'm glad to say i got the platinum already. Also with the platinum came a nice PTSD that makes me look into the sky each time the commentator says something even when I'm now using pistols as secondaries"
"So you kept grinding even when STS got taken out then? Alright then I think I�m gonna keep grinding the kill streaks so when STS comes out again, I wouldn�t have that much left to grind. 

Yeah me too bro. I would always look up whenever a PR pop up even when I had the kill streaks done already. 

Thanks a lot bro!"
"Anything hardcore is good. More people use personal radars and cuavs, which count as ground and support streaks"
"Alright bro thanks a lot! 

I used to do the pistols on hardcore. Didn�t know it would be useful for launchers as well."
I have Obsidian on all launchers except the RPG.
That�s a high level of dedication you got there bro. Congrats though!
I finished the strela in livestock
"Too bad livestock isn�t here anymore ain�t it bro :�) I was just about to try it out for the strela, since it works almost similarly to the RPG."
"I unlocked Damsuss 1 year ago, and i did all my launchers inside GW, STS and other fav maps by accident"
"I tried playing GW for the Attacker and Defender kills and I never seem to get the Promenade map for the JOKR. The point and shoot launchers isn�t really a problem for me since they can be fired directly at the enemy, unlike the JOKR."
"I found the only launcher where STS helped significant was the JOKR, the others I was able to complete without it."
"Hardpoint is the way, pre fire at the next point if they are aggressively holding it, 

For defense fire at the most likely route your opponents coming from,

Also if you know the thermal trick you can do it slightly faster"
Yeah bro I�m stuck with the JOKR and the STS playlist is the best and probably the easiest way to get it gold due to its lobbed projectile.
Dont forget Ground War
Alright bro thanks!
shipment is good for personnel kills but tough for killstreaks as it is so crowded it�s hard to aim the launcher without getting killed.
Yeah bro especially the JOKR :�)
Laughs in my  8man+ feed with the JOKR on shipment
"The gamemode where care packages drop in a zone helped me for obsidian + would work well for the killstreak challenges

Dropzone is it?"
Yeah it�s the dropzone mode. Too bad that that mode had been taken out a long time ago.
"I did most of my grind outside shoot the ship.  The launchers mostly came from natural playing.  If someone ran a personal or counter I shot them down.  I didn�t really think much of the grind initially so I had the RPG and Pilla fairly well in befit started.  The Joker was the worst, but it�s doable on open maps.  

Free for all has been said to have the most and you can grind launchers there.  As for everything else, it just takes a little patience and attention to your map.  Talsik Backlot has long shot locations and you can mount at the same time.  Vacant is great for melee weapons, same with Cheshire Park.

People will say shipment and shoot house because they�re the easiest, but it�s absolutely doable outside of those two maps."
"Yeah bro I�ve been doing the kill streaks challenge in FFA and it had absolutely been a lifesaver since everyone uses the PR and CUAVs on there.

Yeah STS isn�t the only way you can get camos done, it just makes it a whole lot easier. 

Anyway, thanks a lot bro!"
"If they added DLSS it would make a world of a difference. 

It�s nice that Treyarch included it in coldwar."
Yea this would be big but they dont care about mw anymore....they just promote cold war like its the WORLD FIRST COD and iam sick of it
What is your CPU? Keep in mind that Nvidia's driver has more CPU overhead in DX12/Vulkan: https://youtu.be/JLEIJhunaW8
ryzen 9 3900x
The only other gun I see besides the kar or spr these days is the lever action.
When I play the game I run into so many spr user's it's not funny
The SPR-208 is overpowered.  You have the mobility and aim speed of a pistol with a one shot kill of a sniper.
"I don't know why but it comes to the SPR-208 when you equip a lot of speed perks on top of the sniper scope cyber the SubZero scope or the Vintage scope 

The cons on those scopes is to have reduce ADS speed 

But when you slap so much speed attachments on that weapon and equip the scopes it's like the cons don't exist 

I tested this out on both the Kar98k and the SPR I slapped speed attachments and the scopes and compared them

On the Kar98k you actually do see the con in effect

on the SPR you don't"
"Honestly, a weak GPU and a high ultra wide resolution sounds like the culprit. Your just hitting a GPU bottleneck.

You�ve got a great CPU and very fast ram. But a 980ti just doesn�t cut it, the game is pretty decently demanding where even my 3060ti gets around 140fps at 1080p with graphics set high/max at a standard 16:9 ratio.

Their might not be a way to save MW unless you turn down the Res to 1080p - and even then that might not save it.

Cold War though, you can keep your native resolution of 3440x1440 & use DLSS to achieve a targeted frame rate of 60+ FPS 

If your getting 35-40fps, DLSS quality mode should get you nearly their. Performance mode should for sure."
"Thank you for the reply!  
Oddly enough, it still does great in other games. Only these 2 are causing problems! I did try turning it down to 1080p, even in windowed mode. Though that still didn't work, which you'd think would? I actually got a bit worse fps in some cases. I'll give that a shot though, with DLSS thanks!"
"Unless I'm just blind and missing it, but where is the DLSS setting?"
That card is not good enough to run it at 1440p you need to drop that down to 1080p max. Honesty that might not even help much as your GPU is not really going to help you with this game. But definitely lower your res.
"Thanks.
Yeah oddly even lowering the res to 1080p for example didn't really help (seemed worse or about the same). I tried paying zombies last night and was getting 25-35fps, almost unplayable especially when things were more intense."
"If you are good at M&K I would advise against it. 

If you are normally really good then the Matchmaking Algorithm will pair you with decent M&K players, even if you switch to controller, and you may find it harder to keep up.

You should give it a try if you have a controller. You may find it suits you better."
"Most youtubers use controllers on PC cause they're former console players who record their footage on PC cause it's typically higher quality. They don't want to switch to KB+M because it requires them to learn all over again.

Do not switch from KB+M to controller, unless you're already comfortable with controllers."
"Using a controller is easier I guess, but the best M&KB players will always be better than the best controller users. Idk if it�s rlly worth it tbh"
Saying using a controller is easier is subjective. Some people are naturally more comfortable with 1 or the other.
"i only play multiplayer so i disable crossplay, you still get some controller players on PC from time to time but its a lot less common. (wish they would let us select input-type rather than platform). Id rather get shit on by skill an entire game than killed once by software."
"I always found controllers limiting and have had better aim in fortnite and COD with a M+KB than I ever did with a controller. I played with controllers since I was a kid and only switched to PC about 4 years ago in my late 20's and felt I was better at aiming within a few weeks of the switch. 

I think that aim assist OP thing may be true for the top 1% of controller players or something. The way I play COD and other shooting games I feel the ability to quickly look around using my whole arm is much more intuitive than wiggling my thumb back and fourth"
Noooope. Nope nope nope nope. It's just like jumping from ps5 to ps3 just cause ps3 game library is bigger
"Nah, i made the switch from controller to kbm last year and dont regret it at all. Kbm is far superior when you get decent with it.

Ive gone back to controller every now and then when i just wanna sit back and relax, and i absolutely suck with it now. Aim assist doesnt aim for you, but i think good controller players can be slighlty more consistant with tracking than average mouse players. They both have their own advantages and disadvantages, but i think the advantages of mouse greatly outweigh controller if you're any bit good on mouse. If you just wanna switch things up and see how controller feels, then go for it. 

As far as aim assist looking op, Good players are just good players. Really good mouse players look like they have aim bot most of the time"
"Keyboard and mouse simply has more potential for recoil control, especially while being able to get on target faster

Also aim assist can screw you if you have more than one target, and doesn't work once you have to lead your targets because of bv. Sometimes aim assist just turns itself off."
m&kb higher skillceiling. Controller more chill and casual
Daaaaaaaa maaaaaaannnnnnn
"I've been inspired. Jumped on COD, using that loadout, purely because of this video."

Welcome to call of duty
OP sound so honest in this post. It's cute! Remind me of my starting couple of years of cod gaming.
"Aiming just takes time but something that will help you more in fights is movement and map knowledge. The odin is a solid gun but it is super slow for the ARs.  All the ""Blueprints"" and operator outfits are cosmetic, most being earned through battle pass or being bought. Same deal with executions. Warzone is a battle royale and the objective is to be the last one standing outta everybody. There are ""contracts"" that give you extra cash for supplies but are completely optional. I hope this helps a little bit.  Tip: pre-aim high traffic areas or flank routes before rushing. Also when pre-aiming dont aim for the corner but where they will be when they whip around the corner. Hope this helps. Have fun!"
"About Warzone, this is all you need: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_3-UGY7sQJNQvD-4kz4t6FahekvvSWv6

About all your MW questions, there's a couple of things. Forst of all, you have to know you've come late into the party. Although MW is far better than cold war, Activision is no longer realeasing much content for MW. There were 6 seasons for it with a Battle Pass and a load of mission content that allowed you to unclock operators and gun blueprints. Nevertheless, for the most part, blueprints do not actually have an edge on custom weapons. Then there are the gun, tracer and operator bundles that people bought during that time, which is why you see stuff you don't own. Operators make no difference unless they blend in with the surroundings.

About people aiming faster, guns are not all the same. Some are lighter, some are heavier. Some kill faster but are harder to aim and so on. I encourage you to do a private game with a couple of bots and test weapons with different attachments (for faster aim down sights you'll want to try lasers, grips and stocks that make it faster. Check the stats in the gunsmith). Here you can use all the guns, even if you didn't unlock them. You'll not only find the perfect gun for you, you'll get better aim and spatial awareness so you can play more aggressive while killing more than you get killed. Knowing the maps is important too.

About 6...I got it once or twice. Wouldn't say it's normal but it is crappy and I'm sorry even though I never did it, not even when I was their age."
"Adding on to this, when you see a kill cam the vendor isn't a perfect copy (recording) of what actually took place, its a slight sped up recreation based on the data.  So when you look at the kill cam, it will look faster than normal because it has been altered that way to increase the pace of the game and to return you to the fight sooner.  

For more accurate stats on your weapon builds go to truegamedata.com.  its not perfect, but its pretty damn good."
"Try using a lighter gun, like fennec or mp5/7. It depends on your style of playing. I am using fennec/oden (short/ medium range) on multiplayer (using two main weapons).
Try using a wired network connection, and configure your console on dmz on the router."
"The learning curve is very steep in this game ... the oden is a good gun but maybe try using a weapon with a faster ads and sprint out time. This is import because most players are running around but they are using weapons in which they can aim down sight with very quickly this puts you at a disadvantage especially if your not a good at aiming yet. 

Just keep playing and trying new load outs and game modes that suit your play style. I mostly play capture the flag and demolition also because the spawns in these game modes and the game play is usually slower which suits my play style.

Learn the maps 

Use your mini map to identify where the action is.

Try to find cover when you anticipate a gun fight is going to happen.

Keep your centering dot in areas where you think enemies will appear.

practice in custom game modes with bots. I used to do this with a FAL or SKS( semi auto) to get my aiming down. I noticed this really helped my aiming because using these weapons force you to be very accurate.

Maybe some of these will help you"
"Lots of questions! I'll address a few as best as I can. First, think about playing more objective based games like Domination or Hard point. When you get in a game where your team is playing together you can get used to ""running and gunning"" a bit more. Even though you can camp semi-successfully on some maps, as you saw ppl will come clean you out of your spot. Plus, camping gets boring, well unless your hitting ridiculous snipes, lol

1) Lots of factors in speed of shooting an enemy, but I'll tell you a couple you can easily improve. Many players use the same weapons. In MW and Warzone and Cold War there are ""meta"" weapons. Basically, you can search online and folks out there test new or updated guns and get their stats. They then breakdown the best in each class, with the best attachments. So, it's optimal to stay current on this info and level a couple of the fastest ttk(time to kill)guns up and use them in your load out. You might think about using SMGs, bc you can aim down the sights faster on these weapons.  

I was gonna answer all the questions, but after writing all this I looked back at the sub and several posts say what I was gonna say, lol. I will expand on something one of the replies mentioned which I think will help you, though. Go on youtube and look up MW or Warzone movement techniques. You learn things like slide-canceling or jumping around corners to throw off your enemy's aim. You're gonna be up against players who have played shooters for years and 12 year olds with like twice your reaction time(no offense) so in a 1v1 gunfight with them, say you're both standing in the street, using the same gun and see each other at the same time and just stand there and fire---they're gonna win. You gotta learn movement techniques to give you an advantage. To do this on controller, it helps to change your button layout to suit you and make some of those movements easier. I recommend using the ""Tactical"" setting, which puts melee on B and your slide on R analog. This way, you can slide around a corner with your right thumb still on the stick so you can keep aiming on the enemy! There are tons of different controller types and I suggest finding one that allows you to slide and jump while still aiming. It helps a lot. Especially if you're gonna play Warzone. And as far as Warzone, just play that tutorial they've got a few times. Then when you play for real, choose duos or trios and see if you can find a gamer or two that has comms that'll help you understand the pace and tactics. Bc battle royale games like Warzone are entirely different animals than small maps. Good luck!"
Try to change your controller settings and find the one that suits your play style most.
"1) This might be down to your internet latency or your TV's latency, try turning game mode on on your TV if you can.

2) You cannot buy anything useful, even if you buy a blueprint you can't customize it if you haven't unlocked it, blueprints are just for looks, you should just be doing the challenges for unlocking the guns, you can find those challenges by going over the guns in the selection menu. Since you like the Oden, I definitely recommend unlocking the CR 56 AMAX, also try using the Uzi with the 41.AE rounds that require a challenge to unlock too.

1. This is just something you have to get better at.

2. Operators have no effect on gameplay, they have their unique looks, their own lines and quips and their own finishers but nothing more than that.

3. That's a paid Ghost bundle, you can find them in the store. That one is very expensive, 2400 COD points.

4. Yes, finishers you have to buy

5. You're supposed to win by being the only survivor, everyone else in the match has to die.

6.  That's relatively tame, all things considered, had a kid once who found my YouTube channel and somehow found my home town through that and he messaged me that he was gonna come kill me at -my town-.

If you wanna play, I could help you out a bit more, let me know if you're interested."
"You dont have to buy any of the guns. They're all free. If by ""fancy guns that you have to buy"" you mean the store blueprints then yeah they look cool, but they're cosmetic only. You just need to find a class/gun that suits your play style best. If you like the oden, maybe try marksman rifles? I personally love the FAL and SKS."
"Quick update:

I got some great tips here. I've tried some, and may take others up on some offers for lessons.

I learned how to slide cancel, and adjusted my settings. I ended up switching to specialist mode. I start with cold amped, scavenger and extra piece of lethal. Then I unlock lethal regeneration, ghost, and battle hardened.

Played Rust and camped on the high tower. I was dropping a proximity mine every 25 seconds, and otherwise sniping with my Oden. Got about 16 kills and 3 deaths.

Then played Shoothouse. Camped in the second story hallway behind B.  I had enough proximity mines to leave two at both entrances, and otherwise sniped out the window and sometimes popped out the door to fire my bazooka. I got **thirteen** kills without a single death. I realize that's not a big deal compared to what you guys are used to, but I've never done that in my career. At some point after I think the tenth kill, I unlocked Scavenger which basically gives you every perk. One guy I killed at least five times because he kept coming back. He'd either die on my proximity mines or I'd shoot him trying to peek through the door. 

So thanks guys! I'm on a much better path to be competitive now with these 12 year olds who used to be able to steamroll me."

Just try my class set up. I usually mix it up depending on the playstyle of the players in each match. **When you try this set up make sure to use the Tune Up perk and Stopping Power**. DO NOT USE DEAD SILENCE. The AK47 is super loud and it usually gives away your position - even with a suppressor. You have to be pretty accurate with the AK47 (I game on PC) to see the full potential of this setup. With the AK47, when Stopping Power rounds are equipped, headshots are deadly stupid (*usually 1 shot to the dome)*. This setup is not for intended for camping - its intended for rushing, holding objectives and playing behind enemy lines. The Claymore is to be used in odd locations, or if you are engaged with enemy's and cant watch a flank. I find that I get more kills with the claymore than the frag grenade or any other lethal equipment. Once you have specialist - play aggressive *but smart*. Specialist grants you Shrapnel meaning you can have x2 lethal items (x2 claymore) which is perfect for players who use EOD. Have fun!"
"Been playing cod since Medal of Honor days, if that makes sense to the younger gamers. I�m on XBox so if you want we can do a private match and I can help you out.  PM me I�ll give you my gamer tag.

I find the hardest launcher to be the RPG because of all of the killstreaks destroyed required.
Yup I feel ya. Have another 30 to go for platinum then onto the shield and combat knife.

I would love it even more if they occasionally had limited time modes with killstreaks turned off.

"Such an underrated game mode. I feel like the weapons in MW are geared for this type of gameplay. The differences between weapon classes don't matter at all on traditional tiny maps, whereas in GW you're screwed if you try to take an SMG/shotgun outside of buildings"

"i bet after the match they were like ""why the fuck were we in defcon"" sheesh i wonder why xD"
If you have enough people maybe you can set up a private game of cops and robbers? people do it in many variations on this game so i guess you can search them up.
"a fun gamemode originally from unreal tournament (at least i think so) is called mutant. its a mode where one player is the mutant and others need to kill him. as the mutant you get enhanced speed, agility, partial invisibility and more health, but you need to kill to regain health and after some time without killing, you die. when a person kills the mutant, he becomes the mutant and scoring is based on how many kills as the mutant you got"
here's a thread from two months ago that has a few good ideas: https://reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/kmj8wo/ideas_for_custom_private_match_game_modes/
"SnD, Overkill with 2 riot shields on shipment."
"Don't worry, just hold on your COD Points and wait for the bundle to show up. The store rotates the bundle options every week, and everyday for the 'for you' section (I think)."
Alright thank you!
They rotate. Look for it again later.
Thank you for letting me know!
I think you can also find it pressing R staying in the armory looking at a scar or a m19
"I tried that, and they didn�t pop up, but other ppl here have said the shop rotates, thanks anyways!"
"I bought it recently by simply going to the armory, then the scar, then just selecting the red tracer pack. They're all listed. It shouldn't be different for you. And if the scar doesn't show it, hover over the M19 in the armory and check those blueprints too."
"I checked it multiple times to make sure I didn�t miss it. I checked both the scar and the m19 parts and it didn�t show up in the armory or the shop itself. But other people have been saying just watch and wait essentially, thank you for your help!"
you can't use real money bought skins in other platforms :(
Well thats some bulllshit

Your account was hacked because of Activision's terrible security. Always enable 2FA if you can. Keep bothering support about it because some people have gotten their accounts back. They dont just randomly delete accounts after all.
I had 2FA enabled

What are your warzone graphics settings?  Can you post screenshot of the whole thing please
"EBR in aground War is honestly top tier. One hit headshot from any distance and it�s semi auto.

Who voted for the Kar?
For me honestly all of these guns are pretty viable
"what misguided souls voted Kar? Do they just have sausage fingers and actually meant to click on ""Show Results""?"
Well in warzone i rather use ebr than carbine
Yep same here. Maybe swap it for MP
"I mean, there's only one answer to this, if we're real right now."
"For multiplayer ebr, considering that both carbine and kar have the 1 shot 1 kill possibility without aiming for the head. Not a bad weapon tho, surprisingly good at medium ranges but worse than other marksman due to being a 2 tap killer"
m14. The other 2 are beyond broken.
"Why, because they can OHK? A bolt/lever action rifle that couldn't OHK would be unusably underpowered."
The salute just makes it.
"lmao i laughed so hard, where did they end up??"
I think the drone started flying away as well as upward so they zoomed across the map
You can do this to get on top of the airport roof. From there you can rain down bullets.

I also want that!
"I don�t know them, so probably not. Sorry!"
That quad kill was absolute bullshit you weren't even aiming at him or firing in the direction he was travelling. He literally drove away from your bullet and it still killed him. Guy must've been raging
If you go frame by frame it looks a lot more legit. He does a really fast snap to the right that doesn't show up well when playing the video at normal speed.
I think that might have been a little bit of desync but I *was* swinging my gun to the right so I�m not sure if it was just the scope visually dragging behind cause I was turning or something
You act like you've never played call of duty before. This shit happens all the time.
I slowed it down and he 100% dragscoped right over him and got him. I thought it was total bullshit at first too.
Drag scope? Is this a new thing to you?
That aim assist on console.  I've 1v1ed a lot of console kids and they can miss me by inches and it counts

Think it was like a level reset with the cold war merge so now ranking up unlocks items from cold war primarily - or to my understanding. Fair few of the mw guns are still viable/relevant tho so it's not all bad
"It�s just because of the level reset. Those are the things you would be unlocking if you had never played before. Don�t worry about it, I started playing again recently too and had the same question."
Just sad. Mw so much better than ops
"Nice job, dude!!

Any toxic comments from the enemy team?

Whenever I've pulled this off they scream racial slurs because they think I'm streaming, jokes on them though, my internet can't handle streaming."
"nah they were pretty quiet, I was the one raging about not getting a teammate through 11 rounds lmfao."

"Go to your audio settings and go to �Open Mic Recording Threshold�.

It�s the game. More specifically the servers. My ping goes up to 900 at times and will fuck my life up for about 2 minutes at a time.
Yeah..I've seen my ping as low as 46. I'm averaging between 60 to 80 if that says anything.  Good to know my wife was right though.
"Yep, it lags for me and then the game crashes"
"They are downgrading the servers over time, its only gonna get worse"
"That sucks I didnt notice that they did that yet, but might be bc people would use it to jump to weird parts of the maps that you wouldn't normally be able to."
Every time a glitch popped up they removed the spot instead and there hasn't been one in the last 3-5 updates before they removed it.
Dp (deployable cover not double penetration)
Yea I used it to get on top of that one ledge in Ramaaza but they patched that :(
"If the dc is facing directly towards a wall you can still get on it, so vacant spot still works and hackney yard still works.
Edit: dc not dp"
"i didnt notice anything out of the ordinary.

the devs clearly implemented some latency delay when firing on the move,  especially sprinting to give the player on the receiving end some time to react.

if you are mentioning about lag and netcode issues. theres nothing much devs could do without punnishing either side"
"They need to dip into the their pockets and invest in more data centres and better servers, COD�s elephant in the room has always been lag, everyone is banging on about next gen but I�d you still connect to bad servers it doesn�t matter how many frames or pixels you have, good post btw"
"Thanks :) unfortunately what lead me to this post is, often I would run into these issues and look at my ping and packet loss first and foremost. Come to find out half the time my ping is 20-40 which is great and they would appear to have the same if not a tad bit more ping. 30-50ish which realistically, not that noticeable at all and any type of lag spike will skew this result (You could get a lag spike of 80 ping for half a second that doesn't even register on your latency). Which also leads me to the prediction system. if it was a hit reg issue, then we would have to have similar ping, if it's the prediction system they have implemented- then I would either be the one with high ping or they would be the one with high ping. Which is hard for the average person to tell the differences. Which turns into a mess. the casual/chill players will be the most confused and wrongfully report other players when they feel they've been cheated."
Mw is great but it plays a bit different than most cods. Personally my fav cod I ever played since mw2 but it�s very very sweaty and toxic.
"As someone who owns both MW and BOCW, I can tell you'll be literally sweating playing BOCW. If it's not as toxic as MW is with the voice chat (tbh I think people in MW do it for the nostalgia), it's ten times more toxic in people's playstyle. Everyone is seeking out revenge like it's their dick you just cut off, anyone who knows any slightly more advanced movements than going forward will be abusing it every time they're in a gunfight"
Yes
It�s a great game
"The truth is probably in the middle between best game ever and completely sucks. My experience is that you got to adapt and get a little good at it to have fun. I'm an extremely average (if not moderately mediocre) player and I'm having fun with it. Lots of people is still playing so finding games is not an issue at all. Price is a little steep, but in my opinion is worth it. (get modern warfare not cold war)

edit: this is from the perspective of someone not heavily invested in it. I don't stream and and I don't want to max out every gun, I'm a 34 year old dude who pops in for an hour or so every day to have a few deatmatches and quits as soon as he's not having fun anymore."
MW is not a chill game to play while watching youtube . If you aren't playing with headphones and trying to soundwhore people's footsteps you're going to have a bad time. It is very sweaty and competitive. I suggest you play something else if you're looking for a casual experience. Even cold war is super sweaty.
search & destroy for when you're feeling sweaty and pretty much everything else for when you want to chill. The weekly playlists usually have something for every play style
"of course! Granted you'll encounter sweaties, but you'll also get your typical chill games. Just be mindful about the game pass: the game allows you to purchase it, but the rewards are mainly for cold war. In other words if you drop $10 on that pass, and you have no cold war game, you got fucked"
"It's a great game ...
I play game everyday and enjoy.
I have no problem with MW"
"Been thinking about getting this game for like 3weeks now I think I've been playing CW since december and had fun with it I guess but there's just not enough of guns I can fuck with, so MW is kinda perfect for me even if this game doesnt get a lot of updates in future. Though no way I'm playing 79CAD for a dying game so still waiting for the deal on ps store. But really getting tired of waiting haha"
"I got the game around 1 month back as well. Been enjoying it alot more then Cold war.

The only thing which gets super annoying is the match making. For some odd reason after every 2-3 games , i get team mates who are either AFK or get just 1-2 kills in the whole game. I am no means good at the game myself. But i can get atleast 12-15 per game. 

The gunplay is so so much better then cold war though !"
Its probably my favorite after mw2 so i think its worth
"Buy it online.

I got the disc but encountered the infamous copy add-on  bug a few months ago and I tried everything to solve it, I couldn't make it work. Searched online and tried this and that, can't make it work. (PS4)

Rebooting it
Reset to factory settings
This and that, nadda."
"It�s fun, I still play it. A lot of the times though you�ll have sweaty lobbies with most people abusing metas etc. movement is more important than other cods, it�s fun but not what I play when I want something casual, I mostly just play when I have a group of friends that want to."
Who�s turn is it to ask this question tomorrow?
"Man, I always get tryhards and hackers; why can�t I get helpful people like you do?"
"Put a camouflage on that shield, it tells people like me you�re grinding and I�m happy to help."
"Hahaha. It's so rare, but the few who have been this cool i wish them happiness the rest of their lives."
Those jumpy/dropshotting bastards.
I managed to complete all of the challenges and got the last one (3 kills in 1 life) to 19/25 without help yesterday. A wholesome gamer moment happened and some dudes helped me save time and got me the last challenge completed.
"I remember doing this last year. Before the lobby began I would just be like hey guys, can you help me with my riot shield??!? I play hardcore so you�d have both enemies and friendlies killing the guys trying to help me lol. Congrats on the riot shield!"
Thank you brother!
Had this happen today didnt know people did that. Still got a bunch of 3 kills without dying to go though
Update just got the best game of riot an entire team let me get gold and also end with nuke. Much love to my riot friends
I went through that hell and got one nice guy that got me through half of the 3 streaks camos in a single match. From then on I have tried to help out as many people as I notice while playing.
"You�re welcome, I remember the struggle and the toxic players.  Slap a camouflage on that shield as it tells people like me you�re grinding and I�m happy to help."
I�ve been grinding riot shield for a week now and have yet to see this. I do get a ton of thermites when I�m on two out of three kills though.
I recommend you play Hardcore 10v10. I completed the riot shield in about 8 hours of playtime.
I was able to finish last night after my post. So relieved to be done. Best of luck with the grind and hope you run across a few enemies willing to help a bit.
If someone asks in the text chat I usually send them a party invite and we meet up
damn dude I don't remember people being able to read text chat since S3
"I�ll help whoever with it, message me if you want"
I�ve done this a few times. Always make sure to get my Damascus riot shield out just to let them know it�s doable as they smash my back in hahaha
Scum
Thx
"The mp7 loves to flick, it�s so fun to use"
Dont all weapons flick the same?
Scum
Thx
"Crazy that these people actually think this is hacking....

Apparently people haven't ever heard of flicking..

I've had moments like this not just on CoD, but in Overwatch too, where I even surprise myself, look back at the clip and I'm like ""Damn, looks like I have aimbot there"".

This is so clearly NOT hacks. I've seen too many to know that this isn't one."

I love it bro and also I am a main Nikto
Nikto was my main all seasons until I switched to Mara kawaii cat lol.
i see more cringe Krueger than i do roze
yeah maybe in like Season 1
"i donno, I see more ghosts thatn I do roze."
Because she�s invisible until she jumps from a corner and blows your brains out. Just common sense. Lol
lotta hate for a skin in a game where anime kitty can blastoise you across a map
Found the Roze
It gets hate because it's pay to win. Roze is basically invisible in any poorly lit area.
"I prefer plunder because it's more consistent action. People don't feel the need to camp when the stakes for dying are low enough, and the reward for killing is good enough.

Warzone has the same problem as any other BR, which is downtime and risk management (which sounds fun but really isn't most of the time). Oh, and permadeath. Gulag is a nice solution to the buzzkill that is permadeath, but it's still just a bandaid. Same reason why I could never get into SnD. Just can't handle the pressure of being gone for good. I play better when I know dying isn't a biggie.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Warzone got popular because there was a giant hole left in PvP battle royale modes when DayZ went bust. People really love playing against other real players. People love the risk factor. Can't argue with that.

Check out SovietWomble's 3-part video essay on DayZ. It will explain the rise of Warzone and others in the genre quite well."
"its bout the intensity, the adrenaline rush when ya actually win"
But why would i play a game that i know im most likely going to lose every time?
It makes getting a win way more enjoyable.
You have never won a warzone game
Winning isn�t the only thing that makes something fun
"Overcoming the insane odds against you is insanely fun when it happens, and as you get better, you can have a WAY better win rate than 1-5%.

Beyond that, it's free to play. That's huge for a lot of people."
"I don't really get it either. Most games are balanced in a way that you're guaranteed to lose. You really only win when the game allows you to. I only play warzone from time to time because it's the only game one of my friends will play right now. The amount of times I've been blatantly robbed of a win on warzone is ridiculous. When it gets down to the last 1-2 circles you can tell that the circle locations are favoring a specific squad. 

I've called cluster strikes on top of entire squads hiding behind a single rock and not even get a hitmarker. Once I tossed a flashbang at the last remaining team who was also behind a rock. It exploded within 5 feet of them with a clear line of sight and didn't touch any of them. I promptly got lasered because I was already moving towards them, assuming my flash bang would actually hit them and it didn't. My squad once got lit up by 4 different squads when we were on top of a police station, and 3 of those squads were on the ground in the middle of the open and they could clearly see each other, much better than they could see us.

Warzone has a good formula but the execution is piss poor. I'm just waiting for someone to copy it and make a game that isn't rigged to hell and back in order to retain all the trash players."

"Try out Rebirth Resurgence, [It's the most I've ever had in a battle royale](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/m2g9rg/i_had_luck_on_my_side_on_this_match) and I've won 64 matches on record (the real number should be over a hundred but they didn't start counting until later).
It's basically what Call Of Duty battle royale should be like, fast paced and exciting, not slow and tedious like most matches in Verdansk are."
"bro that's the whole point they want to get you addicted, you're supposed to chase the high you rarely get"
that's like the whole point of brs xD
"Why do you think Battle Royale exists then?   


It's because it's kind of logical that not many will survive being thrown into a bucket with everyone being armed. That's the fun, being the one out of the hundred. Trying to get there.   


Why do you live if you have to go to school and maybe uni to even get a job, let alone get paid? Why work if the salary comes once a month?"

Forgot to mention that it would not include a maximum of 4 players I just used 4 players as an example!
"I care about both. It gives me more challenging ways to play the game so i enjoy it more. I would love to have every single blueprint and damascus, however it would take plenty of time"
"You're not the only one that likes them, Plague Sore is one of my favorite blueprints in the game. It makes the Dragunov look so clean."
"Plague Sore is awesome, I use the dragunov solely because of the look of the Plague Sore lol. And the great scope it has. 

Is that the mission where you need a 15 kill streak and a quad feed? I remember I just had to leave it active for weeks until I got it lol (I did it before shipment was added)"
"I�m someone who goes for both, although I got Damascus.  For me it was a challenge that made the game fun and Damascus is a big trophy.  The blueprints have some good options, and others where I can�t stand the challenge.  Like I can�t stand ground war, so I occasionally try with a mission and then walk away from that mode because I don�t find it fun."
"Well that's the thing. It always loops back to camo, but I really don't get what's so appealing/attractive to consider it a big trophy. To me completing all the blueprints missions is a big achievement because it gives me unique rewards (and to me worth more also) and is more technical in some respects."
You can't even do the warzone weapon challenges anymore. they took it off. I was stuck on the thicket challenge and for a season or two you couldn't even change which mission.
"Yeah that's too bad. I don't get, Acti wants to kill MW, why did they remove WZ missions ?  
And no way to get them somehow?"
"I've been slowly working my way through those missions. I love them. Hardest so far was the Steel Curtain AK47,.because getting 5 SnD wins is pretty hard without friends lol

Love the Judgement 725. Unlocked it a few days ago and it looks awesome"
"I got all the missions except 2 done in multiplayer, I want to work on COOP next."
"I've been doing them but they seem a little Underwhelming to get, so far ive done the missoms for the piercer (mp7) howler(one of the  Pistols) and I think beg red (model 680 ) and they don't really seem all that interesting besides the big red"
"Nope. I got the Big Red blueprint yesterday for my shotgun, and the P90 one before that.

I've already got damascus, but some of the weapons can look better with damascus on blueprints, so that's what I'm trying to get. The P90 blueprint from MW multiplayer looks amazing with mastery camos.

I try to have at least 1 blueprint per weapon, so I have more variety, and I'd say it works pretty well. I'm satisfied with most of my weapons(just want to get some DLC ones gold)."
Those missions are way easier then damascus
"Honestly some are very difficult and unnatural.  
One of the most dreaded camo challenge is the mounted one, and maybe the longshots. But these are flowing more natural than some of the trickiest and complex blueprint missions.  
Launchers and riots are other beasts."
"I just don�t have the time to invest to get Damascus. I got gold and platinum on every thing except launchers, shields and melee. I enjoy playing, but people who have no job or kids got Damascus early on and now just run SMG. And I really don�t like loosing so I can�t justify taking the punishment just only to get a couple shield kills and lose the round for a camo."
That happened to me when the enemy team was trash talking in the chat so I wrote some very offensive replies
I didn�t write anything though
"I�m not even able to log into the game. Just kicked me out when I went from MW to Cold War. Giving me all kinds of errors, and now saying there�s a temporary service outage."
That�s strange. So far that�s never happened to me. The only thing close to that is now the chat box won�t tell me friends sign on anymore. It�s been like for months now :/
3rd time 2 days.
Contact them then....it gives out a specific code so they will certainly know what it means
What sensitivity do you play on
Last time I checked I think High Defualt no customizations to it
If you croch a prox mine won't kill you
"Specifically is Black ops, Black ops 2, and World at War active?"
"S&D isn�t ranked or held to any other importance than the W/L ratio.

I might get downvoted for this, but I get on to have fun. I try not to leave games, but if I come across a full team of riot shield and 725 users for example, I�m not staying.

People stay on games and leave games as they please. It�s kind of the dynamic of S&D especially on MW"
I was about to write this.. no way am I staying in a 725 riot shield match lol
I agree but when you�re the good player in the �balanced team� which means your team mates get shit on even if you carry them and are winning they tend to leave a lot. It�s very rare I finish a game with a full team. Especially because no one can join after 4 rounds it�s very annoying.
sorry what is 725?
S&D is the most competitive mode right next to Hardpoint. If you're a noob in S&D and constantly getting bodied just to leave then shouldn't queue for that in the first place lol
What if I need to poop? What if my wife start seducing me? What if my boss need me asap? Just don�t.

Whats funny is everyone whom I come up against or play with who complained about �sweats�... play exactly like the people they�re complaining about
">Also, make it to where if a party member leaves, the party the forgiveness doesnt apply to the other party members so they dont exploit it

What?"
"Party members cant just do this:


�Yo joe, we�re losing, get the smurf to leave so we dont get penalized�"
"Every gamemode uses ""skill""-based matchmaking, so every game is ranked and should result in a penalty for leaving."
when im losing i dont leave but the moment i get jumpshotted and slide cancelled dropshotted im leaving. i play to have fun
MW is a dead game. Why would they change anything now? Lol

I can't believe my eyes. A vertical horizontal video.
"Not to be THAT person, but why don't you clip it through ur console and then upload it?"
I LOVED LIVESTOCK 4V4!!!!! I want that all the time now
Livestock is cool. The problem is there aren't spots that you could call in killstreaks cause then you have to worry about getting shot every time. In grind on livestock I called in a vtol a couple times and got shot immediately. In my opinion no offense but I'm kind of glad they removed it.
[removed]
"Besides killstreak confirmed, shipment 24/7 and shoothouse 24/7 l like dropzone as well!!! I'm currently trying to get my jokr gold. I'm going on a grind to get damascus and only have six weapons gold currently."
Idk what�s up with people and these sour ass responses. You are 100% correct. Almost the entire community wants this. They continue to ignore us purposely
They do ignore us purposely. Seems that way. Sometimes I'll play on the bigger maps too but I'm also trying to get the damascus camo for all of my weapons. I still have a long way to go but so far have six weapons with the gold cameo. Shipment and shoothouse makes it easier to go on the damascus grind. Killstreak confirmed I like cause in that mode streak progress doesn't reset upon death and picking up enemy tags counts towards your streak progress in killstreak confirmed.
Does the entire community even like the game when they refuse to play on any other map that's not named shoot house or shipment?
"Because u/suitable-wasbabi-3458 requested it, it must happen. Like what, you think the world revolves around you?"
It's not just your aim assist it's also aim-antiassist on mouse/keyboard on PC.
"So everyone's experiencing it too?

So weird man."
">aim-antiassist on mouse/keyboard on PC

Could you elaborate?"
"Aside from my group, (TDM, KC, Domination) I scarcely run into PC players. Besides I think he means HIS aim assist not being spot on.

Just last night I played for like 4 hours, and ran into maybe 6 other PC players. Turning off cross-play, I'll be waiting for a match for far too long where it places me in the 200ping servers.

Aside from that, I think the OP was regarding his own aim assist not feeling right. Which to me my only suggestion is to try and get better at aiming without the need of aim assist, you're only ruining your own muscle memory of real time aiming to where once a game comes out without aim assist, you're going to fail miserably and not like/play that game.

The people saying aim assist is only to balance out vs MKB is ignorant imo, there are far more console players playing CoD than PC, so aim assist is only balancing out vs other console players when it comes down to it which is an oxymoronic way to think about it."
I agree. We need an explanation here. My aim assist of on ps4 is all over the place. Sometimes it feels like it changes game to game. The best way for me to describe it is �sticky.� When aim assist is working it feels sticky. While when it�s not I can�t just shit and I swear the feeling of aim assists stickyness changes game to game
"6 sensitivity is very slow. 

That being said they may have adjusted the curves again. It�s happened like 6 times since the game released, and they never announce it. 

Every time I start noticing I�m not getting kills or struggling to aim as usual, figure it�s just me but then I come across reddit where a bunch of other people are saying the same. 

It�s annoying because it takes a while to get used to the changes."
"I've noticed it as well but for me I noticed. It when they first integrated CW into mw and now I just don't pay attention to it anymore because I know it's probably never gonna be fixed. For my experience I notice it's sometes super heavy to where it's almost like soft locking and following enemy's to a certain degree, and. Other times It's non existent, 

ironicly I'm worse when it's  actually working more On the heavy side because I'll aim at someone only for aim assist to mess me up by ""locking on"" To someone that runs In front of the person I'm trying to aim at"
"I like how when people complain about how strong aim assist is, and want it removed/disabled during some matches/modes, all the people using aim assist (after countless hours of arguing back and forth) will eventually say ""Well aim assist isn't that strong"" or ""It's not as strong as you think it is"" trying to dumb down valid points about aim assist... but when it starts messing up you SURE notice it huh? XD this thread is great.

Here is the thing, When people say ""My aim assist is all over the place"" that is in fact just your aim... aim assist doesn't go ""All over the place"" lol which leads me to what I said before, You're gimping yourself and your muscle memory of true aim, so much to the point where once aim assist starts acting up and/or just not working how you're used to, This happens :| Frustration. instead of being butt hurt about when people hate on aim assist, can you not see this point? I mean it's in the OP lol"
"The strength of aim assist is definitely overblown by PC players. That said, people who play consistently on console and build their muscle memory around it will immediately notice if it changes or disappears. Imagine someone goes into your mouse settings and very briefly increases your sensitivity by 10-15%. You're going to notice it immediately. I have extensively played over a dozen console FPS games over the years and I easily have close to or over 1 million kills, all with aim assist. I can tell immediately if the strength of aim assist has changed on the fly. I actually have several clips where you can tell just by watching that there is zero aim assist. The most recent one I have i deliberately swept back and forth across an enemy I had just downed, and there is none whatsoever but after the 4th or 5th sweep, you see aim assist kick in clear as day. Any long time console player will know if aim assist has changed. It's got nothing to do with being bad at the game."
"But I'm not butt hurt or upset.

All I'm saying is that it's super inconsistent and it's just annoying."
be like that sometimes
those irons are hard to aim with
I love the striker iron sights
I have no idea why but my aim has been absolute trash recently. However my controller sticks are really damaged which might contribute to that.
I highly recommend you check out Kovaaks 2.0 Aim Trainer.
"My aim isn't always this shit but thanks, I'll check it out!"
That's what shotguns are for
no clue why but I just can't hip with shotguns anymore
They are great. Just use a medium sized one not the tall one. Just gives your what feels like more range of motion. Takes a week to get used to
"Yes they are worth it. Improved my aim alot, been using them for years.

Couldn't play without them now."
"They didn�t work well for me. They�re definitely more precise, but they also felt both too �touchy� and too unresponsive. Just my own experience, but I didn�t love them. Ended up removing them and not looking back."
"I used to play with Freeks and other thumbstick pads and I've actually gone back to playing with the regular pads. The medium freeks weren't anything to write home about, and it's definitely the advertising that'll make you want them."
"No. Not imo. Seemed like a waste. Maybe more precise, but you have to move the joystick around so far to get to the edges and it was just uncomfortable."
"Dome on the right analog, works for me and it has worked for 5 plus years I recommend the add ons"
"My friends I play with swear by them and say they are worth the purchase. I have not personally used them but they used to play on about 7-10 sensitivity and now play on the max sensitivity because they say it gives them a lot of control on the sticks. Depending on your play style, it may seem worth it or not if you�re not used to playing on high sensitivity"
"I was skeptical about them but my friend uses them and talked me into trying them and I definitely notice a difference. It took me about a week to get used to them aswell as getting used to changing my sensitivity to slightly lower than what I was used to but once I was adjusted I felt a lot more accurate with everything.

I�ve been using them since December and I almost can�t play without them now."
Couldn't get used to them. I felt extremely uncomfortable because of the elevated height and the plastic feel
"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cr6WknJYTGQ

Try this?"
I don't know how but it fixed itself... uhhh thanks computer wizards?
They removed the ability to gift bundles since December because it was bugged. You�d pay and it wouldn�t show up. They claim they�re working on a fix but that was months ago. The only thing they�ve been updating in the app is the CDL shit.
Well you�re just a dumbass i gifted a bundle yesterday get your shitty info out of here.
"Companion app doesn't seem to be getting updates anymore, AFAIK you can't even gift battle passes anymore since BOCW release."
They�ve been updating it for the CDL stuff that no one aside from kids gives a shit about. There�s plenty of bugs though that haven�t been fixed since December. Mostly related to the store and bundles.
"Exactly  it is a new shit bug . And activision still tries to ban who has the soap bundle but it dosen't  care about banning cheaters and wallhackers and ..... . I have problem with this bug for about a month but activision wont fix it. 
Such a nice support........"

With the colossal supressor to flex
The sa87 is pretty good if you stack it with attachments. Same with the mg 34
I�ve never used those guns until I wanted to get them gold and the SA87 really isn�t bad. Same with the M91. Especially in hardcore
"FR 5.56, MP7, M2, Deagle"
"Uzi, AK47, AN-94, JAK12"
I'm seeing a theme here.

MK2 if you land your shots
"I've been using a low-no recoil Grau and it's been fun, it will absolutely melt at long distance and feels snappy when you go from target to target"
"aug or bizon are fun weapons for me. aug has downsides but i just like it, as for the bizon, 64 rounds in the mag is really nice"
Crossbow once you unlock it
"The Famas is my go to, everyone hates it but I love it"
"Pretty much every gun, just unlock some attachments and it�ll do fine.






(Except the  UMP45, gosh that gun is shit, what a shame)"
"For me lately I've been using the striker and sa87, there pretty fun to use"
Holger-26 because MW '07 is still alive in my heart :(
"My favorites of each class:

ARs: 

Grau is really good if you get maybe 2-3 recoil reducing attatchments,  amazing irons, high ammo count, and good fire rate/damage.

M13 is also one of my favorites, because it has low recoil,  a high fire rate, and large mag size.

FAL is a really fun semi-auto gun, and it's amazing in MP and WZ(if you play it). You can spam the trigger and basically 1-2 shot people cross map, with a 30 round mag(once leveled up).

SMGs: I'll divide this into 2 lists, One for being sweaty, and one for fun.

Sweaty: MP5/MP7. Both have good hipfire, fire rate, and mobility. They're really fun to use, but fall under the sweaty category since they're ""Meta"" because of how good they are.

Fun: I find the P90 and Bizon fun. If you build them right, they have good iron sights, almost no recoil, high fire rate, and large mag size. They're really good for a sniper support weapon since they're good at range.

Shotguns: Dividing into trolly, and fun to see other's pain.

Trolly: Basically slug 725/Jak-12 with explosive rounds. One shots cross map if you hit your shots. People will be complaining about how broken they are.

Fun to see pain: Double sawed off 725 with SoH(sleight of hand), 32 round Jak-12.

725: The ""broken"" shotgun. High damage, long range if you build it right, double barrel so if the first shot doesn't kill, you can put out a second shot and it usually kills them.

32 round Jak-12: Literally a full auto shotgun with 32 rounds. Need I say more?

Marksmans: Divided into meta, and fun.

Meta: Kar-98 and SPR. Fastest ADS, 1 shot upper body/head. The SPR with lapua rounds extends the 1 shot zone further down, so it's better if you're not as accurate.

Fun: Crossbow, Mk2. If you can hit your shots, they can be as deadly, if not more than the previous ones.

Snipers: I personally don't like them too much, but the HDR is fun to play ground war with. They just suffer from too slow ADS when built for range, and not as good as the SPR when build for quickscoping.

Pistols: I like the .50 Gs, and the revolvers.

.50: If you hit headshots: it one shots. If you don't, it's usually a 2 shot to the body. It's also got really good range. I've hit a 200m longshot with it before.

Revolver: snakeshot. Akimbo. That's all I need to say. 1-2 shots close range, and if you use both at once, you can dominate like it's a secondary shotgun, so you can get a different second perk.

Melee: Kali sticks are easily the best weapon in this category. They 2 shot with extreme lunge on them, and you can attack like 15 times a second with them.

Launchers: RPG is fun, rest are for anti-killstreak. The Strela is a contender, but it's not as viable as the RPG. If you can hit a direct hit with it, it 1 shots, and travels around 100 m/s.

This is my personal list of favorite weapons. Some of these are better stat wise than others, so be aware of this."
"Thank you, this was very informative."
"I wanna chime in here I agree with almost everything you said, but the frag rounds on the jak are completely useless. Unless you get a legit direct hit they don't do shit for damage, their velocity is a joke, and you get maybe 16 rounds in reserve. If you're trying to use the jak for anything outside of maybe like 13 meters you're better off using slugs, and slugs suck because the gun bounces around too much lol not trying to be a dick or anything, just some advice from someone who has it obsidian. The gun is a low tier shotgun on any map thats not shoot house or shipment. I can go on and on about this gun, but thought I'd just throw in my two cents"
The P90 rocks
"I will have a look at it, thanks."
I personally love the fennec
That's the Vector looking un right? Ill have to unlock it first but I always did enjoy that gun in older cods.
Does RPG count as a gun? Cuz it�s fun.
Well from what I've seen so far it's better than most pistols.
As Val is super meta but also super fun especially if you play mouse and keyboard
"When I�m playing for real: MP7 or Ram-7

For fun: Jak-12, Crossbow, AN-94, MK2, Finn"
Kilo. Just straight up Kilo.
"My favorite smg is by far the fennec, it may not be top tier, but its a blast to use.
Also the jak12, its a low tier shotgun on pretty much every map besides ship/shoothouse, but it is a blast to use if you don't mind hit markers lol max it out for range, stick the 20 round drum and a 5mw laser on there any go to town"
"m4a1 is fun when playing casually, but the AX50 is a nice gun too"
"M4A1 is the first gun I started using, seem like a fairly flexible gun."
"I remember sticking with MW2 because I thought black ops was shit back in 2010

Now here we are in 2021 and I'm sticking with MW2019 because cold war is shit"
Except Black Ops wasn�t shit lol it�s one of their best titles
"If there really is content on standby, from a marketing/company perspective it's nothing unusual. Remember CID MWII remastered? That hot withheld for like a year or more, and eventually no multiplayer. 

Hopefully in a year we'll get the new COD MWII, I didn't get Cold War, didn't wanna tarnish the memory of black ops 1, one of my favourites."
There is. Dataminers found 2 6V6 and 2 Gunfight maps in addition to 3 weapons that were even available in Spec Ops.
Facts
"Im so pissed at this, why tf do they wanna kill their own games just to squeeze some extra bucks from us? I am never buying CW, sticking to MW until MW2"
"Can someone explain to me why Activision has to sabotage their game for Treyarch. Like whose idea was it to fuck up warzone, give MW a battle pass that earns nothing for MW except for lazy vehicle spraypaints, and make MW a CW billboard, and why does activision listen?"
"What do you mean by ""for Treyarch?"" You think Activision is doing this for them, that Treyarch is calling the shots? Nah, Activision calls the shots entirely. They're doing it because that's how they've always done it. Drop the old game like a bad habit, push the new one. And as obsolescence culture becomes more rampant, their efforts become more extreme. Just watch what happens to CW when the next CoD comes."
"from every point i can think of this is just making ACTV lose money and is a horrible buissness decision 

&#x200B;

but then again when have they ever been known for making good buisness decisions?"
At what point are they losing money though? Just want to hear your idea
I want them to release that makarove pistol so baldly
SBMM. I left the game. I was a 1.7 in warzone so slightly above average. Every game is sweaty roze skin. I have exactly zero fun anymore. I play once a week if that and I just can�t relax and have fun anymore. A lot of my friends quit recently too. I think they �upped� the SBMM gradually the last two seasons. It sure felt like it.
It is what happens when u play a competitive game.
"There is no skill based match making in Warzone.  Unfortunately because the myths surrounding the matching system and those trying to explore its flaws, you have a ton of reverse boosters who are ruining the game.  This goes along in connection with so many streamers emphasizing their stats, which unsurprisingly no one can see.

Skill based matchmaking actually helped the game.  I say this because you have so many toxic people who say things like get good when others are genuinely trying to improve.  In reality, those types of players are sloppy and can�t actually play well, they just know how to exploit the game flaws (like spawn traps and broken weapons).  Skill based matchmaking gives the opportunity for people to actually improve and develop skill rather than leave and not play the game.

I have experienced not systems, and left after MW3 because I was tired of being a clay pigeon every game.  After playing the current Modern Warfare, I am a lot better because I had a fighting chance and developed my playing abilities.  Yes, some games are tough as nails, but I don�t have to experience 30 deaths and 6 kills every single game.

With that said, skill based matchmaking actually saved the franchise, because more players can actually have fun.  Yes there are those who complain because they can�t steamroll everyone else and they suddenly face actual competition.  However, if the old system remained, more would have left and never returned."
"Your flaw is thinking the size of a subreddit means anything. There are on average 7k users here a day. (Cold War is 3.5-4K. So guess we can conclude you suck at maffs) That�s not even a drop in the bucket of overall players. 

Cold War on the other hand broke into the top 20 US game sales of all time. Something not even Modern Warfare could achieve. You don�t do that if your game isn�t popular. 

Subreddit size, twitch streams/views - those are absolutely meaningless. The vast majority of cod players are casuals and couldn�t give two shits about Reddit or YouTubers. The only ones who do are people here. You guys are in a bubble."
And here you are.. constantly winging about not getting new content in your store lmao.
"I�ve got several issues with what you said here.

1 is that you think sales is proportional to popularity. The majority of sales for Cold War would have happened very early on, before anyone realized how much the game sucked. Game sales could right now look amazing on paper but in reality the game could be barely populated.

2 is that you mentioned this subreddit�s proportionally low traffic compared to Cold War�s despite that that game is actively getting supported right now and Modern Warfare hasn�t been supported for months. That considered, Cold War�s subreddit user traffic looks even worse. It stands perfectly well to reason that this sub would be experiencing less traffic now.

On top of these things, how do you explain Modern Warfare�s hugely larger subreddit base if not game popularity? Still waiting for your theory on that."
"It took BO 6 weeks to reach the revenue MW brought in within 3 days of launch. Numberrs don't mean everything and you are missing the point. They know their game is going to shit which is why they are pushing it on the players that chose to stick with MW. It's not a secret and they aren't hiding it from everyone. The game is a flop and even they know it. Whether or not it sold a lot of copies, it's still a bad game. Cyberpunk broke digital sales record. The game was still a flop in terms of popularity. This isn't anything new either. Games have broken records in the past but that doesn't make them good."
"Ah yes, everyone here is the expert economist with insider data behind Activision's profits and losses.

You don't know the current active playerbases of each, where their MTX revenue is currently coming from, and so much more. Stop acting like you do.

Both games are bags of shit anyway. MW is just a golden bag."
No one needs �insider data� they need public sources that literally publish the data. Got in a heated argument with another guy that insisted the game broke the top 20 video games sales of all time.
"This sub is so fucking boring man, we were told that this game would get a year of content, and then that's that. And yet everyone is still surprised that the game isn't getting any new content?????????

This is coming from someone who hates CW, and has 40 days of play time on Modern Warfare."
"Strangely enough, I'm enjoying Black Ops Cold War quite a lot, but nowhere near the fun I had with MW2019. I feel like it's still the more superior COD title."
"It really confuses me how people have such a raving desire for more and more content on this game. If you look back at what are regarded as the best games in the franchise, all they got were a few map packs. No atrocious looking camos or outfits. Yet people nowadays feel personally attacked because there isn't a new gun or operator every 2-3 months. Just play the game, stop banking all of the games entertainment value on new content and enjoy the gameplay. You know, the thing that everyone *used* to play these games for? It's an established fact and has been for a decade that COD games are tossed aside by developers once their 1 year cycle is over. This game has a laundry list of things that I'm more than happy to complain about, but lack of content after a new game releases isn't a new concept."
This would hold up if the content wasn�t *already made.*
"It's 2021, not 2009, expectations and support change. Also the fact that MW19 is by far the new bar among top tier simcades-FPS (in term of quality and features rich) is what make people more hooked with MW19 than they did with the previous releases or even CW. MW19 is just such a solid game !  
(you can can criticize gameplay choices, but they are there, rich and extensive)"
It doesn�t make sense because its not true dumbass
"I've definitely completed that one a while ago, and it was rough. PKM is advisable due to dps and per mag, i'd use fmj for the armour, snatch grip, muzzle brake, blue dot holo or reflex, tac laser

Riot shield can stop all damage from suicide bombers head on, more reliable if you crouch, plus protects you if you get overwhelmed or need to defuse the bomb in the crate stages

Thermite is a great lethal - enemies that walk though where it sticks tend to die, maybe use stims or stuns to rush defuse from cover or revive a teammate.

I don't know if you could cheese this one, but armoured enemies in regular dif still get 2 shot meleed like unarmoured enemies. Sometimes in co-op I run an uzi with the shortest barrel (8.5''), no stock, breacher device, fast melee perk and 5mw laser. It moves real fast, one shot melees anything that isn't a jug/other kill streak, and the recoil is pretty easy to control as the kick and fire rate is low + all recoil increases from attachments are vertical

From memory, when an enemy is shot it will get a yellow skull over its head; it will change colour depending on how many people have shot it. This indicates the multiplier on damage dealt to that enemy. Try and tag enemies so that your teammates can finish them easier, and shoot enemies your teammates have shot/are shooting.

Hiding inside in the pool house and using chopper gunners makes the first defending till 'exfil' pretty easy

If you want I can show you the blueprint with gold/plat/Damascus

Hope this helps"
"Now if I could just find a team to do this I�d have that blueprint.  Solid advice as I have nothing to add, but would�ve said many of the same things."
"Thanks for the reply! Yeah it definitely is hard, I used the riot shield for my primary and the dual kodachis as my main weapons. Brought a chopper gunner and 2 juggs like you said. I haven't yet beaten it as my squad always has died during the 2nd crate defending. I'll keep at it though. Just have to get good randoms that retry if we lose then leave the game"
"Usually the reccomendation is 4 medics, LMG + Riot shield, and stocking up on sentry turrets and juggernaut suits."
"2 guys with bali sticks(one hit kill) and riot shield (double time) that clear mines and RPGs. 2 guys with 200 PKM FMJ, 4 medics.

Sentry guns. Juggs. 

Someone said go around the superstore not through. 

20th time playing, can't beat it."
What playlist? (What objective)
I find the what objective one ironic because people ignore the objective anyways and treat it like tdm
Objectives mode not that bad bro
Guys who quick scope and no scope are awesome I enjoy watching them play knowing i cant do it lol
The SPR makes it pretty easy to no scope. Basically where you are looking is where it will go for 10m or so.
Satisfying
 Bring me back Shipment 24/7 on Call Of Duty Modern Warfare: 2019 its the  most playable map and enjoyable and best for grinding gold weapons
"I'm happy with my 5000 crossbow kills, want to go for my throwing knife kills I'm at 18000"
Wow that was a lucky shot!

"The store is pretty awkward, some people report seeing season 1 vault packs, some people can't find it at all.

Same thing goes with the SAW/Texas Chainsaw Massacre bundles."
Vault packs? Meaning what was in that seasons battle pass? That�s weird
"All the new bundles (Domino, Lerch and now Roze) were removed from the game after a week .. at least I thi k that's the case with Roze as well but I'm not 100% sure because I got that bundle so I can't see it in the store anymore"
"Yep, new bundles only stay around 6 days. Basically one playlist rotation. No one knows why because no one interacts with the
community. Started once Black Ops launched."
Eh store shuffles items from time to time just wait to see if it comes back around
"I've got the same problem with the Lerch TacGas one. Missed it the first week, never came back."
You probably only want it in the hopes that it gives you the black one
Actually no I already own that
Game is even worse without map voting
Yeah It really does suck
Here we go again
Lol you probably hear this a lot don�t you
"I don't get why they're holding back on the most popular playlist, like its already been a season and a playlist like shoot the ship isn't really going to make a difference, people who play CW generally just stick to that the whole time anyways. I just straight up dislike CW after giving it 24 hours, i'd rather level my CW guns for warzone in plunder than play CW, removing shoot the ship isn't going to magically make me play CW.

They literally shove all their CW content into your face and think that you'll somehow buy it, but like most of their shit just looks hella fucking bad for some reason, which ironically makes me want to purchase all the leaked MW stuff thatt they have going around.

I find it just hilarious that they sort've advertised sharing battle pass exp and prestige levels but literally everything that's unlocked is something from CW and all MW does is add a method to leveling."
Is it back with the playlist update?
No
Unfortunately but they really should make it�s separate game mode that�s permanent like death match or kill confirmed
"You�ll get tokens, calling cards and emblems. Also vehicle skins. 

I think that�s it. Obviously no weapons since there are for CW and Warzone. Operators not sure."
All operators are Cold War/Warzone only as well.
"The only thing you�re gonna get for mw from this pass are calling cards and vehicle skins

Everything else like blueprints, watches, operators, charms and stickers go to cold war shit"
you can use stickers in mw guns and equip the vehicle skins of the truck and I think calling cards and horns are available also in MW
"Thanks all. Worst they will say is no. But the battle pass is basically false advertising, especially when compared to what we previously got for the same price.

Might be worthwhile if multiple people complained to their consumer act. If multiple countries complained, we might get traction."
"It�s not false advertising. Everything in the Battle Pass is labeled �Cold War�. It�s been this way since December. I think multiple people have already filed legitimate complaints, and nothing has come, because there�s nothing there. Even if it was false advertising, then what? Activision isn�t gonna tell IW to make a new Battle Pass. You�d MAYBE get a COD points refund that�s it?"
"You�d get the vehicle skins, weapon variants, and operator skins to use in Warzone. But that stuff isn�t used in MW itself."
Could use the vehicle skins in ground war in MW
"I don�t know what your going to be trying to accomplish with whatever your complaint is going to be, but yeah battle pass stuff is currently only for Cold War and warzone. Nothing is for modern warfare."
Holy shit the level of entitlement of some CoD players is astonishing
Everything is labeled black ops cold war and warzone which isn�t false advertising. Your complaint isn�t gonna go anywhere at all. If you don�t think activision consulted their legal team before things they do you�re crazy.
"whilst I agree with you, that type of thinking is how companies will eventually take advantage of consumers more and more because they know no one will bother to check if what they're doing is legal"

"Just open warzone, its all one big game now. When you open any of them, the starting menu will show cold war, warzone, and MW."
oh wow that's a bit confusing. Thanks!
are you playing against bots ? i�ve never seen people so bad
Yes I was this was for a video project I did in school
Mooooooom loooooooooooook I can aim and click with a (80% of the time) 1 shot gun against bots. ME SOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
So are you upset at the video itself or is there something going on in your life that makes you want to bring other people down?
Prepare to get canceled for endorsing sweaty players. I 100% agree with you though. The movement in CW is a big reason why I don�t enjoy it. It�s hard to go from something as revolutionary as MW and then feel like you�re taking a few steps back with CW mechanics.
"Yeah agreed. Cold War has a lot going for it, but the downgrade in movement makes it less enjoyable for me."
Agree 100%. MW could have come out after cold war and we would think its a huge leap forward.
Coldwar's movement feels jank af hate it honestly.
Cw is black ops 3 with better graphics. Literally... That's why the only maps that work properly on cw are the redone ones
Get rid of sliding tho
"I dunno why people hate tac-sprinting, shits good af"
Agreed my friend.
People don't hate tactical sprint
I�m with you. I hate black ops. It�s an absolute step backwards in quality. As hard as I find MW it has way better flow.
They should not call it mw2 man shit would be stupid and confusing
Like when they called this game Modern Warfare AFTER releasing Modern Warfare Remastered?
They need to just release a MASSIVE update for the current game and optimize it for next gen.
Modern Warfare Part II maybe? Either that or a stupid ass subtitle like Cold War
I think it's too late for that
"I think it will be called ""Modern Warfare II""."
"Modern Warfare makes me feel A LOT more in control of my character and movements than Cold War. Cold War feels stiff and clunky, and the awful aim assist makes it even worse"
Mostly what I want to see in the next game is the same as this just without doors and with better map design. No more picadillys or promenades .
"I can handle doors, just better map design. With a good map design you should be able to get a door camper from behind. Or at least, make doors fully destroyable like in r6.

In the other hand, promenade is just an awful ripoff of op. Metro / op. Locker"
"I actually hope the next MW has another picadilly type map. It's nice to have an unconventional map layout based on a real area. I'd love to see other real styled maps 

Plus I think Picaddily is a great map, but maybe that's just me"
"I actually like doors, especially as a S&D fan since it gives a lot of information on which routes people take and just makes the rounds a bit faster imo. If they bring back the old minimap (and ghost being inactive when standing still), I think it would lessen what people hate about doors right now.

For dead silence I don't have an opinion but I absolutely love the added movespeed you get from the field upgrade when active. So if the alternative is to have it as an always must have perk for run and gun, I'd rather have it as a field upgrade and bring something else.

I want them to keep shoot house in the next cod or make more maps in a similar style. To me its probably the best map design you can want in a COD. Every weapon type is viable and what changes the playstyle is just the routes you take in between the lanes to shorten the encounter range. I think its a lovely way to make snipers as usable as shotguns in the same map by just having clever lane traversal.

EDIT: Also they absolutely need to keep the fact you hear the enemy's voice coms a couple seconds after they die. I swear its the best fucking feature they have ever added"
"Yes! And a normal red dot Minimap, with Dead Silence as a perk plus Ghost not working when still! Game would be close to perfect outside of weapon balance fr."
I like picadilly quite a bit. And doors. Doors are great. Doors are really hard to make and they fucking nailed it.
Or just a simple map filter.
"Can�t have that. It would invalidate their perception that they created a masterpiece with these unnecessarily complex maps with 5000 different corners, crevices, peep holes, obscure lines of sight and windows to get popped from after running around for 5 minutes to no avail."
The quick game filter is a mess. It takes ages to get a decent map. Hop on the game and have fun instantly? Impossible. Release some good playlists ffs. Shoot the ship is the dream but it won't happen. The current playlists is a joke. Off for another week. Thanks activision.
So a playlist with the best maps in the game? lol
"I mean, you've basically described the full map rotation for Free-For-All.

I guess FFA also has Hovec, Tank Factory, Azhir, and Picc, but it's easy enough to back out of those few. The bulk of the maps I get in FFA are almost always the ones you've listed. 

Hope that helps  :)

PS � I think they should also have FFA automatically form up into 4-person lobbies when there isn't enough people right away for an 8-person lobby, and for the 4-person lobbies it should be FFA on the Gunfight maps. At least for the Hardcore variant, it always seems to take longer to get a game on in HC FFA. 

It'd be so rad to have 4-person Hardcore Free-For-All on the Gunfight maps!"
"I like all those maps except Cheshire and usually Khandor. See, what we really need is A MAP FILTER"
"They won't do that because Activision and IW hate their MW community. They give us Shipment and Shoot House only weeks at a time. They've made MW a campers paradise. While I don't begrudge camping per se, IW seems content not give anything to its non-camper community."
"I might been lucky but since CW released I�ve experienced a lot less camping. 

Honestly i�ve think i�ve enjoyed playing even more since CW came out when it comes to how the matches are. 

I only play HC and domination or 10v10 mode."
"Best maps selection to me, you just forgot Livestock."
NO CHESHIRE! THAT MAP SUCK
The rapid fire playlist on Cold War is also a great way to rack up more kills and have some fun.  (Constant uav pings on smaller maps).

Thought I only had 5 things to finish, only to realize I needed the Origin shotty, finished that and realized I hadn't finished the Kar98. Took me 7 days to finish the 7 items needed.

As you can tell, I'm not very good with marksmen rifles and can't quick scope for shit. lol"
Helllll yeah! Congrats!! And you didn�t even end with launchers. I envy you!! Haha
What map did you do the 3x shield on? Its soo hard man
Congrats man!
Way to go!
Rip
Such a shitty birthday weekend playlist
You too?
What playlist? (What objective)
It shouldn't even be called a playlist as nobody will play it
They want you to play Cold War..  I personally enjoy MW a lot more though I do own both
MW is WAY better... not even CLOSE.
Of course they want people to play Cold War that�s how business works
"No Rust, no Shipment, no Shoothouse, and removing Livestock just means I won�t be playing for like another 2 weeks. See you next update"
What�s the playlist for today?
My obsidian grind was going so well until they removed shoot the house and then livestock lmaooo. Now I�m sweating over face off trying to get my 15 kills before the match ends.
Thank god we get objective gamemodes that count kills for the 20th time this season. Don't know what I would do without that...
I�m getting sick of seeing this same post every Thursday lol
"You'd think that the community had complained enough and that IW could just give it to us to shut everyone up, but no. *Plz buy Cold War. We have Nuke Town 24/7* 

See you next Thursday"
Season 7 rumours didn't come true rip
No shoot the ship kill me
"Yeah, livestock was an alright substitute but it looks like I won't be playing for another week lmfao"
Damn straight Doo Doo why would they take livestock away
I hopped on to play some livestock only to see some stupid objective mode
bruh
MP kinda dry rn but wow warzone got kingslayer thats an awesome gamemode
They removed livestock and my weekend camo grind is ruined...
Why no shoot the ship
"is this really how all playlist updates are gonna go?

&#x200B;

|*week 1*|shoot the ship|
|:-|:-|
|*week 2*|livestock|
|*week 3*|literally nothing|
|*week 4*|shoot the ship|
|*week 5*|something kinda good|
|*week 6*|10v10 but placed in featured|

mw is dead with no chance of revival. shame it's better than cold war otherwise i would have bought that"
"Cool new modes, but what are last mode in mp?"
"If you mean 10v10 Mosh Pit - it's a mixture of various game modes (e.g. Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed ...) played on mid sized & larger maps."
"Screw Roze, return to Ghost."
"Ikr bro. Like that default skin doesn�t have any bit of appeal to me. Even the Rook skin, with its black colours look a bit better (I am definitely not a Rook skin user), just trying to make some comparisons."
None� get Eloko thru MW MP store
"Sorry bro, but I was never a fan of that Grinch guy. But thanks for the suggestion though!"
Wait for the soap bundle
Alright bro thanks!
Save money for soap
Alright thanks a lot bro!
"The ghost pack is really fucking dope. Besides everyone is using Roze rn, because of that black skin"
"Yeah bro I never wanted to buy it before even though I play MW2 as well, but then I realised the dopeness and badass looks of it. 

Not to brag or anything, but I literally have almost all the Ghost skins that had been released in the store, because I just really loved that guy, except the Fighting Spirit since I didn�t really like it that much.

And the Roze black skin always come with the try hard mode equipped bro smh."
How can you buy it? I can't find it in the store. I tried to search for it through the armory but no luck. I should say that I only own warzone. Do you own the mw multiplayer and is it still available for you? Few months ago I was still able to buy it through the armory with blueprints but now when the cw arrived to warzone the blueprint doesn't show up. Thanks for response
"I bought it through the store bro. It came into rotation for me and I immediately grabbed it. 

Yup sad to say it but that�s the thing now bro. After CW was integrated into Warzone, you can�t find packs through the armory anymore.  

And yup, I own MW multiplayer as well. But still, even if you only own Warzone, you should still be able to buy packs from the armory. 

But as I said before, that�s the thing now bro. Back then, you can still buy operator packs through the armory even if you missed it from the store, or when it hadn�t rotated again into the store yet. The only packs that are available through the armory now are only the certain weapon packs and a few not-so-good-looking operator packs.

You should probably wait for the operator pack that you want and grab it from the store when it appears again. As for me, this Ghost pack appeared a few weeks before I posted this question but I didn�t bother to buy it before. Then when it appeared again, I immediately bought it. 

But don�t worry bro, the older packs should still be available for you once they rotate again. Just be sure to check the store everyday since they don�t give you the new items indicator dot on the store tab anymore.

No problem bro. Hope this helps!"
 don�t waste your money on game skins put that shit in the bank or stock market or pretty much anywhere else.
"let people buy what they want, its their money bro fuck"
"Yeah I get what you�re trying to say bro, but I just got some extra money to spend so rather than wasting it on something else, I�d rather use it to buy these packs. 

Besides, I really love this game and didn�t really play anything else other than this game for many seasons now so I think it�ll be okay to spend a few spare bucks once in a while. 

But thanks for your advice though!"

JTF-2 is my jam
I held out hope for the Balkan anti-terror pack and was so happy when it came out. I also rock Polish GROM for coalition
I'd play milsim but damn the default voice for him is bland and boring.
I�m a slut for MilSim skins. I fucking hate those ye ye ass party looking skins.
"I�m English, I like the CTSFO Mi-Sim"

Honestly I think it�d be awesome if you had a customisation system. Like a mix and match of different mil-sim gear or something. Better than 20 people running around as Price or whatever the latest is.
I only have default Mil-Sim. I just wished I bought the battlepass back then.
I�ve been maining the Shadow Company milsim ever since he came out. I just wish he didn�t have that stupid ghostly trail or whatever when diving.
He just bought the game everyone has the same skin
I main Coalition Air Force Pararescue 2
Balkan Special ATU allegiance operator is bad ass...and just as affective as roze in dark areas (sorry guys) only difference is you actually look cool
I use the Balkan or Shadow Company skins. Both are pretty badass.
"You just cant start something with ""this is an indisputable fact"" for something that is a disputable opinion"
"My game works fine, its the lack of cross progression between the games that bothers me. Why isnt my prestige icon showing in MW? Why cant i use prestige keys? Why arent all calling cards available? That shit infurates me"
Just hope bf6 is a banger
"If it's unplayable, it�s a fact that it's unplayable."
"It isn�t an opinion though, explain how he�s wrong?"
I wholeheartedly agree
"... I'm having 0 issues, all my friends and I started playing again, and matchmaking is literally too fast for me to properly edit my loadout. Map loading is only in like first 10 seconds of group war. there is way more content than when I first started playing a year ago. Idk maybe it's just console player (ps4 pro) western europe but 0 complaints here"
"Are you on PC?  I'm on Xbox and have never had those performance issues.  I will say, though, that they have let MW wither on the vine.  And i honestly don't understand why.  If BOCW were objectively the better title, and MW's population were to drop as a result, then fine.  But why go out of your way to drown your baby for the semi-functioning pet donkey?"
lol get a new xbox/ps/pc my friend. MW works seamlessly for me. Played ground war for 3 hours yesterday without an issue. Saying this is an indisputable fact when it�s most likely bad internet or a bad console smh
"Same for me. Never experienced issues with connection for example. Not during beta, during the peak nor now after CW. 

A solid internet connection with cable into the console/pc is a must. 

Honestly I think the game improved some after CW. Not content wise no. There is no seasons and so on. But gameplay wise it�s improved IMO. A lot more games that are fun and people even play the objective! Lot less campers and other trash. 

I guess a lot of the toxic players moved on to CW. 

Sure in an ideal world I would love more seasons/beattle pass, a mapfilter and new content overall. 

But hey the most important thing is gameplay and how one enjoys it. And I still enjoy it and as said, probably even more since CW released. 

As long as there is not (for me) a better option out there I�m happy what I got with MW right now."
"My console and internet are perfectly fine. It loads up Ghost Recon Breakpoint, GTA V, Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1, even Cold War during those free weeks perfectly fine. It's only Modern Warfare with the issues. It's not on my end."
So sad that you don't even see the name Modern Warfare on the menus - it is Warzone now.
"That has got to be the most annoying thing ever. It'd be one thing if it were a smooth transition, but the fact that it has to go and launch MW separately to even pull the menu up is just infuriating."
"yeah I swore off COD after the original blackops, I came back for MW as the strength of the new fresh gameplay gave me hope enough to try it again, sadly this game gave me back my love for call of duty then just ripped it away again, so many things but some of the worst choice the devs made for me would be, packing in warzone and all its store and bullshit in with my COD game that I bought, the game isn't even called MW anymore, its just WARZONE, its a joke, I paid for call of duty 2019, NOT a shitty free to play battleroyale that does NOTHING NEW IN THE GERNE, I'm over this game and I'm happy to say that I really will never buy another call of duty game again in my lifetime and I hope to see teh company get disolved one day, bet the next battlefield is gonna suck bawls too"
"To be fair, Battlefield 6 might be pretty good if they just stick to formula. Everything I�ve been seeing has got me on the hype train again, from bigger battles and the destruction demo, and it's speculated we might get Battlefield 3 remastered(which makes sense when you consider A LOT of Battlefield video creators made videos about BF3 a few months back as if it was to gauge interest) with it. The only thing I�m skeptical about now is the leak about the game not being what we expect BUT when I see it, and if it's anything like classic Battlefield they'll have won my money off the bat because Activision dropped the ball. At least I know they won�t brick the game when they�re done with it after a fucking year."
You say MW in unplayable and a campest while mine runs smooth as butter and CW has the same amount of not more campers which are harder to deal with.
"Literally every year people say the new CoD has less campers, it really just comes down to perception. CoD is a franchise that encourages camping, because irl camping is the tactical thing to do to win in a situation like that. It's up to you to deal with campers, that's what grenades and equipment are for. I camp sometimes, especially when I'm scared. But I also try to outplay campers, because it's a game."
"For fucks sake people stop misreading my post. People have opinions, I�m talking about people talking about what they perceive as campiness and they can have their opinions because I don�t care.

What I�m talking about is the performance of MW getting worse and worse ever since Cold War butted in."
"Hold up 


Let me get this straight 


You think they are purposely sabotaging this game ? The lag and shit ? Servers have been crap and still is 

They aren�t sabotaging it this conspiracy is fucking dumb this game isn�t getting murdered"
It's just weird how there's been Cold War updates mandatory to play Modern Warfare that have added literally nothing to Modern Warfare except bugs.
"The game, at least me, runs fine. I'm mad because Activision and IW keep screwing with maps players enjoy and other little things like that. It's not that I think there is a conspiracy; it's that they just won't listen to their fans and allow them to have what they have drip feed them instead of just giving it to them all the time."
"Gotta agree, i have great wifi and stuff but MW has always been a shitter when it comes to loading stuff in quickly, co-op specifically has always been a laggy mess just like zombies is for cw"
You don�t know Activision truly then
Holy shit is this a bot shilling for Activision
"I prefer MW cause it feels more, like an actual situation each battle than an arcade moshpit. The same people who complain (Urgh I hate that the map is more porus so I cant know where everyone will come from, oh I hate ghost cause I cant just be fed kills.) Does bug me a bit."
"It's not even a matter of the gameplay now, I can�t even sit on the sidelines and watch a battle go on, the game is literally broken."
"Yeah, it happens every year with cod"
I'm never buying another cod game again.
"My only issue is the camping, before the latest shoot the ship left I never had much of a problem, but now that's it's gone it's like every game mode is just the same, it's either a camp match with 725s or I have a brainless team that doesn't know what an objective is and it's just not fun when you have to be the only one trying to do objectives"
Straight up LMFAO at OP �warning� people in this thread
"Yeah, I�ll just straight up block people. Don�t need that kind of negative minded harassment in my life."
"My MW runs perfectly fine, but you�re spot on about everything else"
"I have both, I personally don't like the new Black ops game based solely on preference. Nonetheless, MW has been buggy since release, but BOCW is much worse. I don't think they intentially are killing MW. That would require planning and coordination which historically they have demonstrated they significantly lack."
Question for ya: do you get significantly higher average FPS on MW than you do on BOCW? This has been my experience and I want to know if I should bother trying to reinstall lol
I feel the same way
"Edit: I agree with some of the performance issues, as I know people experience them, but I personally experience very little. But I agree Activision and Infinity Ward are nuturing their own game. It is almost inconceivable how much Activision is trying to kill the MW player base and piss of it's fans. It's like they are trying to piss us off or troll us. ""Here is Livestock. A sort Shipment/Shoot Hoose like map (which we took away, again) for casual players, grinding camos without having to live in a campers paradise. Oh wait, nevermind, we are going to delete that too."" Activision, Infinity Ward, someone, please explain why you hate your player base and the community of people that would purchase your next game? Why are trying to execute MW and a dirty cellar floor? Please give the players some support, the maps they enjoy, and just let us play it. Stop cramming another game down our necks."
"""It was fine in the beta""

""It was fine for the whole lifespan""

We must have been playing two separate games.

Game was trash, stayed trash, and the producing company always has been trash so what do you expect."
Again that comes down to your preference. And again as I have said I do not care about your preference.
Modern Warfare is goat tho
"IDK I just downloaded MW for the first time since before Black Ops dropped (switched from Xbox to PC), and MW runs \*infinitely\* better. I'm getting an average of between 60 and 100 more FPS on MW than I do on Black Ops, ping's consistently below 60ms, matchmaking is completely fine for both multiplayer and warzone, etc. 

I definitely agree that it's almost shocking how poorly optimized BOCW is (I sometimes dip to like 45FPS and I'm running a 3070, WTF Treyarch), but I don't think it's bled over into MW too much, at least in my experience."
"I tried the free trial of Cold War, like, didn't mind it but the SBMM is ridiculously out of control and there's nothing redeeming about actually winning -- half the time you just break even. 

I'm a rusher and always have been, but all the jumping/crouching/drop shotting in that game is just straight up ridiculous."
I hate MW and barely like CW more but agree
In my opinion This is all a big mess because of them trying to integrate 2 separate game engines into warzone. Now all 3 games are suffering.
"Is it just me, or does the game look like dogshit now? I swear. It looks washed out and not as crisp as it used to. It looks like fucking Crap Ops."
Check to see if you have the hd texture packs downloaded.
I�m just gonna give up on play mw and future cos games and move on. I guess I should go out and do other things.
"I play this game almost everyday, granted search 90% of the time but regardless. It has like 2M people playing on a regular basis (this figure may vary at times) but the game is not ruined or dead, infact now its getting even better as everything is settled in and people know how to play the game. The SPR and VAL were the best additions to the game which left it off on a good note for me. I do wish they updated it more often and added new content but its no different then any other cod year. When MW2's life span was over people either moved on to BO1 or stuck with it or played both, granted BO1 was better then cold war, but same idea. I hate cold war so im gonna continue to play mw, its a great game lol."
Just curious why didn't you like BO4? I really liked it well the multi-player was okay but what had me was blackout. I still feel like blackout was a better Battle Royal just because of the picking up attachments part and such in my opinion
Am I the only one That can play modern warfare just perfectly fine?
"COD has been dead since WW2, chief. The skill gap, map quality, and pace/style have been fucked for years."
"They won't kill a game that is still holds a good part of a major playerbase and provides revenue. Saying that I have noticed that the servers have gotten very bad recently, but its probably because they put cold war/ warzone in priority servers that are more stable. Activision has always had server issues so im not surprised.
If Modern Warfare fixes its problems in its next installment, cold war is guaranteed to be dead."
"I�ve had issues with MW after CW released. Slower load times, worse matchmaking, intense lag, etc. but no performance issues on my Series X. Your �indisputable fact� is disputable. I�ve had *multiple* game breaking issues with CW performance but nothing on MW. It sounds like you haven�t tried any troubleshooting."
"I have no issues, only thing that makes it tough now is every one is trying to finish off Damascus or make sniper videos or something, so team based games can can become a boring campy snipe fest on some maps."
weird bois in the comments actually trying to justify that shit xD pathetic
"oh god it just gets worse the more I read comments telling op "" mw isn't campy"" (which he specifically didn't give an opinion on) and iT wOrKs fOR mE. how the fuck is that a counter argument against bad business practices just so stupid man"
"I played recently for the first time in a while, and I was embarrased by the fact that the skins look like fortnite skins now.  Some chick running around with cat ears and yoga pants?  Fuck that shit.  They shouldn't be pandering to that lame fucking game.  This is call of fucking duty!  Pander to the rabid fanbase, or lose them to battlefield.  

Also, is it me, or is ""walking"" now running speed?"
"Your field of view setting may have increased? That can make it look like you're moving more quickly.

As for the skins, I don't love them for me, but if weebs want to subsidize my videogame purchases I say we let them lol"
Sadly agree. Mw is unplayable. Lag and packet loss is all I get. Instead that trash cw plays fine. It's illegal
Cold war servers absolute dog shit also my guy..
This is why I�ve switched to escape from tarkov recently. Have no desire to go back to any cod games now. EFT is in beta still and I swear I have less problems with it than I had with MW.
I agree with your words on the shit they've done to make MW completely invisible but the game runs fine for me.
"Lol ""indisputable fact""."
You�re high on glue
"""Indisputable"" lol"
"How old is MW?  Activision needs to make money, they follow a formula that has given them loads of money.  Why are you saying they killed MW when they are just doing what they are used to doing for making easy money?"
"If you load up Black Ops 4, all you get is a little notice that MW is out. If you boot up WW2, you get a notice that BO4 is out. If you open Infinite Warfare, it tells you WW2 is out. You get where I�m going with that.

Now look at MW2019. They dedicated a whole menu section to a buy now button, the entire store is flooded with content exclusive to CW, and the Battlepass is all CW content. Everything in game's load in and Home screen icons are only usable in CW too. This isn�t what they�ve done in the past, this is cramming CW down our throats."
They killed also warzone with the new OP guns from Cold War so now you cant even use MW guns because they suck on warzone
"Literally the only good guns from cold war in warzone are the mac 10, Aug, and ffar. Modern warfare assualt rifles shit on cold war assualt rifles and modern warfare lmgs shit on cold war lmgs. Same for snipers, shotguns, etc. The only argument here is that maybe there are more better smgs in cold war than modern warfare. Other than that, you are pretty much at a disadvantage if you use any cold war gun other than the 3 I mentioned."
"What OP guns? Just because people aren't using MW guns as much as before doesn't mean shit. 90% of the CW guns are ass in WZ. Some of the AR's are top tier *viable,* but they aren't the meta. 

The AMAX is still arguably the best all round utility gun in the game. The MAC10 isn't better than the MW MP5, people just like to think it is. The only real OP CW gun is the FFAR, and it'll likely get nerfed in the next couple patches. Snipers? Still the KAR98 hands down."
"Huh


Looks like gaming Revolution got it wrong"
How did anyone think that we�re going to get mw2 content again?
This is why i dont trust cod youtubers
What MW2 new content?

Unplug and plug your consle back in
I'll try.
Same here. Playing on PC.

"Nice shots!

If you can get a feel for it the Dragunov is a ton of fun, if you haven�t already gotten gold for it try the 660 extended barrel, tac laser, variable zoom scope, FTAC stalker stock and either focus or slight of hand. Very easy to manage, and the FTAC stalker actually adds a ton of stability despite what it says it does. Also if you get onto a 6v6 map you can still get longshots on, that same setup but with the 510mm barrel is actually bugged and completely disables idle sway."
"Thanks for the comment. I did manage to get gold on it. Just need the .357, JOKR, shield and knife. Gonna be a tough grind to close it out!"
For some reason when I play infected it�s against these zombies instead of a player
It�s because they�re all busy doing blow out of each other�s assholes to celebrate the sweet sweet earnings from the microtransactions
"And when they aren�t doing that, they are working on Modern Warfare 2."
"Try and do a live chat with Activision support on their website. You'll have to wait a long time and they might even disconnect you, but it eventually worked for me and I got my account back"
I done that waiting for ages but they sorted out my problem in like 2mins once I got to chat online with someone
Did you have 2fa
"I hate this whole mentality of �well if you didn�t have 2FA your account deserved to be hacked�

Most of us console players didn�t even know our accounts could be stolen from the activision website rather than our systems which we play on."
"I talked to some people on twitter that have the same problem, and the only thing that you can hope for is to either wait couple of months in hope that they will answer you back, or start over again.
The second option is so painful knowing i poured hundreds of euros in items.."
I came to this sub looking for this. I got hacked out of my account and I need to get it back or I�ll never spend my time or money on one of these games again. This happens too often.
Good luck ... same thing happened to my bro. He has opened 5 tickets since the end of last year. No response
You have to make a successful youtube channel and/or be a streamer to get support. Everyone knows that.
"I can relate. Early February I returned home from a long day looking forward to play on my 200 hr + 400 $ + mw acc and it said to log in. Okay fair, I put in my user name and password, the screen of nightmares pops up. It was incorrect. I was hacked. I have since then emailed them and absolutely no response since. Unlucky."
"Emailing them or sending them DMs on Twitter won�t help at all. You�ll need to fill out the account recovery form online and make sure you fill it out correctly and add all necessary and relevant details. After you submit that you�ll be given a case number. Try to chat with a support agent a few times a week to ensure your case is being dealt with. The chat wait times are absurd though (2-4 hours) but you gotta do it. 

It�s also a very hit and miss situation with the support agent you get. I chatted with them on 5 different occasions and the first 4 agents were straight up useless. The 5th one was actually kind enough to help me. After that chat session, I got my account back within 24 hours. Just make sure you remember your original Activision ID, your platform, your email (one that was hacked) and if you have any proof like screenshots of in game purchases etc, you can upload those in chat if you request the agent to send you a link. 

Hope this helps. Cheers"
I have hope but I have no faith.
*Where is your goddamn faith Arthur?*
"I'm speculating here, of course, but it looks like they will gradually inundate Verdansk with Zombies over the remainder of Season Two.  Today they say they've made it to the Prison.  Maybe next week it's the farmland.  So on and so on.

Eventually, leaks point to a ""Plague"" mode where everyone has to fight off zombies in all of Verdansk and then, in conjunction with the new exfil mode they introduced, exit stage left before the nuke(s) goes off.  Logically, it makes some sense, but with the recent leaks looking like bunk for the most part, I'm taking it with a grain of salt for now.

I would imagine Activision/developers want to give everyone a heads up as to when Verdansk is officially phased out as the main map.  I think it makes a lot more sense that it happens during a normal transition period between seasons.  I would suspect they are aiming for Season 3 to be that time.

Possible they run into delays and so forth.  Maybe they had planned to do this sooner but kept having to push it back.  I would guess the Outbreak maps in Cold War are stitched together with additional areas to form the new Warzone map.

Given all that information, at this point I have to assume none of these buried Modern Warfare guns/skins actually get released because at this point in the game, it doesn't make much sense.  They are continuing to gradually phase out MW.  Adding new content is the antithesis of that.

This is my extremely long-winded version of saying I've run out of both hope and faith.  If they wanted these items in MW, they would have released them by now.  Continuing to wait makes even less sense.  They have no incentive or reason to add in new MW content."
Won't buy any other CoD again if they ruin this event
It's my birthday too by the way
"Third time I'm saying it. They reset any progression players previously made on the new weapons. I take that as a sign they care to release them fresh for everyone. Of course, this is all speculation, but I have hope.

The radio silence on Infinity Ward's end is odd. They added these weapons a long time ago, mentioned S7 in the S6 battle pass, and have not actively addressed or dismissed this widespread rumor. Again, I have hope, and I really want my Scorpion.

Whether or not the drop is solid, I'm not buying any game from them again. I paid for MW, not a giant ad for that CW trash."
They didn�t mention a season 7 in the season 6 battle pass blog people just thought there would be one cause of a copy and paste sentence they used in every battle pass blog.
I sure as hell hope so man. I�ve found this to be very annoying
"I dont know whats gonna happen next, but I'm ready for Activision to do something awful and unforseen.  


Like, you can get access to the bundles only if you bought CW, and the CW battlepass- and even then you can only use them after you sign a legally binding agreement to never play MW multiplayer again."
They already kinda did that in Black Ops 4 where you had to buy all the DLC to play any of it.
 Let's hope they do. There is literally no reason for not releasing the guns and bumbles. It's free money for them.
Getty just dropping in to say nope
Hoping against hope. I�ll never ask anything more from this game if they just release these already. It�s been too long.
I just wanna fucking play on Trials without those stupit tickets (I�ve 108).
Doesn�t look like it.
"Not only did we not get new guns, but we also got dogshit playlists. Awesome..."
Pure speculation but I get the feeling cw doesn�t want these guns to outperform theirs. So I get the feeling they�re working on an agreement for the guns performances. Cw wants their guns to continue being the best to sell blueprints and modern warfare wants these guns to decimate all and then just say whoops we�ll tone them down
"The CX-9, at least having used it for a few matches, will be 100% S Tier Meta in Warzone if it gets released in the current state. We just have to wait and see honestly."
The CW guns are fucking OP in war zone.
They even stopped MW bundle sale 6 hours into a 7 week sale b/c it was CW launch.  Don't expect anything from them until warzone content is ready.
"God, I really hope so."
no
What is the playlist for today can't check right now at work.
"Nonthing good, just a objective based. A mix of hard point, dom and another obj. On random maps."
If they aren�t released by the end of season 2 then I feel like soap and the new weapons probably won�t come until IW drops the sequel.
I hope it but I also think that they arent going to release nothing cuz they want you to buy cw and not to play mw
Not necessarily true. If that were the case they wouldn't tie CW battle pass progression with MW MP.
">they want you to buy cw and not to play mw

If reading these comments were a life sustaining activity I�d be immortal."
"Nope, not today. Maybe next season, MAYBE"
I mean 3 new guns would mean big problem to cw. Cold war is dying now how about when you release new content to mw?
I don't get it. People spend the same amount of money in MW and Warzone. Worst that can happen with modern warfare is people are going to spend more money on the soap bundle and get the game next to warzone and CW.
"CW can die. I didn't pay for it, but I have to watch and see its bs loading up the game I purchased and want to play."
Bro how is a game that has a larger player base than modern warfare dying I play with crossplay off and I still find fireteam dirty bomb matches in only like 20-25 seconds
"Shipment 24/7 for Hardcore comes back.

They fix also the mechanical abuse movements, this game is now full off jumping slide prone bull\*\*\*\*."
How do you know shipment 24/7 is coming back?
sorry that you don�t know how movement works and that anyone better than you is �abusing� it
Define them hating modern warfare? They�re simply focusing on the newest release. It doesn�t make much sense to focus on MW.
"But it does when the content is made and waiting, which is the case here. It�s been kept away because CW hasn�t performed well and all the emphasis needs to be on it."

"�Ah yes, the negotiator�"
Hello there
"Yeah you gotta put it on hardcore and do it that way. Do a hardcore objective game though, even if it's just kill confirmed. Otherwise nobody moves and the score ends 48-42. I don't miss that grind though"
Yeah all my SMGs are done now but I've switched to hardcore for ARs. Just not looking forward to the riot shield and I feel the snipers will be a long grind too
">Otherwise nobody moves and the score ends 48-42. I don't miss that grind though

I've said it before, but for activation it is ideal that all matches end when the timer ends instead of randomly based on the score.  You can feel how you want about this but going to the time limit is a feature not a bug is the point.

It allows them to better allocate resources when you know matches start at one time and will end at another."
If only they didnt take out shoothouse ffs
Yeah. I decided to start the grind after they got removed lol. All my SMGs gold so far. I know everyone says launchers are the worst but riot shield seems like it will be
I love that guys sense of humor but I feel your pain
Gods the feels man.
first
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee
"They didn't remove it, it just hasnt popped up in the store yet. Im the same boat as you, I had the bundle show up in my store a few weeks ago and was gonna buy it, but then I lost power for a week. The most we can do is wait for the store to refresh and see if its there."
"Ah, thanks for letting me know!"
Are you in the Warzone armory or the modern warfare multiplayer armory? I saw it in there about a day ago.
Ahh It must not show up on the Warzone one I guess. Thanks for answering!
"That�s the beauty using pistols and knives, you move faster. I do that pop out the window, double back, kill often. Great way to snuff those aggressive hunters and keep em cautious."
"No place like Home mara is very cool, these tracers are awesome"
I always liked Bog Demon
"Ok... well I don't like getting killed by a bug zapper so no Dr. Karelov. Mara has better packs if available than that one, kinda meh, Nikto original bundle (via Armory) is cool, the brainless is meh,  if you like how Roze looks, some do, some don't her bundle now has tracers and dismemberment (cool).  They do cycle them and by looking via the Armory you can find bundles on the guns for sale.   Tracers either you love them or people hate on you nonstop.  LOL"
"Dr Karlov has a great AK blueprint. It�s based off the Volk from Infinite Warfare and the tracers are pretty cool. Not a fan of the outfit. It was worth it for the gun alone for me personally. 

The Amethyst pack has one of Iskras coolest outfit, and the tracers are pretty cool as well if you�re into shooting purple flurp."
Karlov AK iron sights are garbage tho
"Do we know what the amethyst tracer guns look like with mastery camos?

Also, when they did that sale out of the blue, [this bundle](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400165-asanbosam) was on sale for 2000 CP or less and it has a similar, stealthier, and arguably cooler Grinch skin, and a finishing move for all operators, plus other tings like a quip and more blueprints, but who knows if theyll do that sale again

Sidenote - codtracker, the website I linked, shows literally every bundle in the game and some that aren't in it yet eg. [https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400569-soap-operator-bundle](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400569-soap-operator-bundle)

You can look for blueprints by weapon or skins by operator, search bundles for words such as tracer etc"
I'm poor and I don't buy packs so I couldn't advise you lol
"You don't want to run minimum. It'll be a bad experience. I would look at ""recommended"" as benchmark.

Edit : around $800 minimum for a pre-built"
Not enough either. For example MW recommended 175 GB storage...
Yet pc gamers still shit on console players while my ps pro can run the game just fine lol
"The shitty but true answer is ""it depends"" - what resolution and refresh rate do you want to play at?

1080p60 you could probably do for 400 with some sales or used parts from r/hardwareswap

1080p144 probably 5-600

1440p60 for 6-700

1440p144 is a big jump so pushing 1K"
"Don't buy a PC if you're on a tight budget. If you use your PC only for gaming and on a budget, just buy a PS5/XSX. That is your ""budget PC"".

You'll have a lot of problem playing with a budget PC. Many of them can be eased if your PC performance is high enough (and more expensive).

Any PC below $1000 will not give you better perfomance than a $500 console.

If you want your PC to be good enough for the whole PS5 age (otherwise why not buy a PS5?), you should at least get a RTX3080 (which has a cheaper AMD equivilant but AMD GPU usually have more compatibility problem) and itself costs $700. The whole budget will be ~$2000 or more."
"Lmao what the fuck no, OP don�t take anyone�s advice here. Just go to a dedicated PC subreddit."
It will most likely be between $600-800 unless you see a killer deal on a secondhand one.
So I should tell him to get a Ps5/XsX instead?
"it really depends on your region and where you'll buy it. Usually there are a lot of parts that you could get used without much fear of something not working.

Although GPUs are a little hard to get at the moment, so i would probably guess ~600 to really get started.

You could go for Ryzen 1600 or some intel equivalent (i5-8400 or better should do), 16GB RAM ideally and maybe ~GTX 1650 Super or a 1060 6GB. You might be able to find a good deal on a used 1080 ti if you are a little lucky.

1650S would run the game at over 100 fps at 1080p. if you want to stick with the bare minimum, you could get a 1050 ti, but i don't think the cost savings here would be worth the difference in performance"
As long you get an rtx cars then it's all set. Devs confirmed dlss is coming to MW eventually and that's free fps.
"Try to get some parts off of r/hardwareswap and you could probably build a decent pc for $600

Edit: If you only care about playing COD then just get a new console. It�ll save you the time of building and troubleshooting a pc"
"I�d say get in touch with activision support, but they�re fucking useless. My account was hacked 2 months ago and they�ve been no help whatsoever."
"Yup, but for us in europe we have to wait for the supports guys to wake up over in the us. Wont be on 20:00 in the evening where I live.. this is hopeless."
"for support try their twitter accounts sometimes I hear people get attention, not for sure.  I understand besides doing 2FA you should unlink accounts and then relink them.  Each platform has it's own tricks n tips.  I'm on PC and I did the unlink/link and 2FA when I heard of a rash of hijacks.   Good luck.

Last desperate is creating a new account. yeah and losing all your shit."
"My PSN is still linked, can he unlink it somehow? He is accessing my activision profile via his blizzard account.."
"Update: talked to a customer support staff, via the live chat at activision.com - The hackers battle.net account was unlinked and everything solved in a nice and timely manner. I recommend everyone in a simmilar situation to take this approach. Waited an hour to get to talk to support, but it was worth it for reaching an actual human."
The only thing i would remove from ground war are the kill streaks
I�d keep them but make the spawning system better.
>  coke addict like sensitivity  LMFAOO
It�s not coke it �GFUEL snorting�sensitivity.
">Why is the Drangonov and the EBR-14 in different categories? By doctrine both are used to provide fast and accurate fire at ranges of 500-800m, yet they have completely different ballistics and damage even through they use a similar cartridge. There�s a few more guns but this is the one that annoys me the most. 

Probably because Sniper Rifles in this game have an scope by default while Marksman Rifles have iron sights instead.

But yeah, I agree that the Dragunov should have been a Marksman Rifle since the beginning.

Also while we're at it, both the Kar98k and SP-R 208 should have been Sniper Rifles instead."
If I wasn�t so poor I�d give you an award 100% agree
Wish they had flinch into ADS if the player was being shot.
"I don't see q problem with pc players, most aren't good to begin with and if the player is good, you'd get smacked no matter their input method"
"I see plenty of coke addict high sens controller players abusing SPR aim assist.  It be what it is.

Edit: Ground war is god awful.  Worst game mode."
Dragunov can one shot.
But the EBR-14 rarely is.
"If only console mw could have a FOV slider. Amount of times I've died to a PC player outside of my vision (and in very ""corner"" of theirs) is absurd. I also feel really slow compar3d to everyone else and my gun is smashed in my face."
"Just spawn back a point and don�t ever spawn on your squad unless you are playing together 

Turn off cross play 

Who cares 

There you go problems solved"
"Let me have my rant, and if you read i covered spawning on a point."
How do some people get continuous kills like this?  It's crazy and beyond me.
"By knowing the map, the spawn points and playing aggressively you can pretty much just run laps and kill multiple players as they spawn"
By catching people mid tactical sprint and with their backs turned
What�s more crazy is how he�s one-shotting everyone with an AK.
I have no idea dude
2 people on the other team was using a knife and kali sticks
"Also, the compass on the top of your screen helps alot!"
"""BuT tHe AK iS a BaD gUn! iT iS sLoW aNd HaS tOo MuCh ReCoIl!""

&#x200B;

Just goes to show every gun is viable, you just gotta put the effort in."
"Come to hardcore, where all guns are viable!"
"The AK has always slapped in this game tho, people just prefer low recoil bullet lasers"
Also helps that it has an infinite 3 hit kill range to the chest.
So this is what people do when get Damascus.
"One of my friends and I occasionally build each other's class to use for a game or two, with the goal of building really bad guns. This ak is just the tip of the iceberg."
Does UAV mark people in yellow like that on core?
"I have colourblind settings on, specifically deuteranopia, which is why enemy names are yellow."
"I would think that AK with that barrel, no stock, and that scope would kick wayy more than that. Good on you for controlling it."
What secondary weapon are you using ??
".357 with pistol scope, biggest barrel, muzzle brake, lockwood stock, can't remember what the last attachment is but it isn't snakeshot"
"Nice stream of kills. 

But how come you can walk down the middle of the street, not using any cover and not get instantly nailed?

I can't even peak a corner without some camping sniper taking my head off?!"
"In this clip UAV is up so I generally know where the players are and can move freely in some parts of the map. But this is just one clip, there are plenty of times that I have been shot in the dome moving from cover to cover!"
He's playing on pc so it is kinda unfair to console users.
"Gun builds:

AK  
\- Compact Barrel  
\- No stock  
\- Drum mag  
\- Variable zoom sniper scope  
\- Bipod

.357  
\- Muzzle Brake  
\- .357 Long barrel  
\- Pistol scope  
\- Heavy duty trigger  
\- Lockwood stock"
Nice - whats the build?
"compact barrel, no stock, bipod, var zoom sniper scope, drum mag

Edit: [Both gun builds here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/m2ocz2/someone_posted_this_meme_ak_build_about_a_week_or/gqlvv3j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"
"I love how some people can do stuff like this all day long, then when I get killed the game absolutely *insists* I get spawned five steps directly in front of the person who killed me 47 times in a row lol"
"I wish I could have smoove people like you on my teams since all of my teammates want to sit in one side of the map and snipe while I'm the only one running around.

Love the build. Good job slapping with it :)"
Dm me your Activision and we'll play some games
"gotta love the AK - may not be the best gun but it's definitely one of the most versatile guns in the game

you can put pretty much anything on it and it'll still be pretty good"
"It's one of my favourite ARs, and I think it has the best dps at range.

My normal AK build is RPK barrel, commando foregrip, 40 rnd, stippled grip and ultralight stock."
Why is this nsfw?
good question
well damn
"Seems fun. I might not be on at the same times as you, but I could help out if we�re on at the same time."
"I'm perfectly okay with that, if you have Xbox, drop me your gamertag and I will help you as well."
What do you mean? You want someone to use your account? Or are you talking about teaming up?
I meant teaming up together. I dont want people to use my account.
I think he means work on camos together which I do not advice since people are getting their activison account hacked and stuff. It would suck if you unlocked Damascus and you get hacked
Much more satisfying doing it yourself...
I get that but it would be more rewarding if both I and a partner got it together or work towards it....
They locked the progression. Which hopefully signals an release is imminent.
I can't even see the weapon in game tbh
Raven locked the progression so it can�t be leveled at this time.  I don�t know if it�s a bug or intentional as they haven�t said anything.
How do you even unlock the weapon?
"Get long shot kills with smgs in like 5 matches if you�ve used an smg then you�ve probably unlocked it, it randomly popped up for me as unlocked when s1 for Cold War went live. You go to survival afterwards and buy it and then you can level it up"
"I like them for MP but not for Warzone.  I was in a WZ match, was mounted trying to shot someone at long range and all i could see were the flashes.  Was a bit annoying."
"This is the exact answer i was looking for. Thank you, I'll stick to emissary then haha!"
They hinder mp5 vision if you're not using barrel mono that hides the tracers but that's about it.
Thanks then i'll stick to non tracers haha
"They won�t just nuke the map out of the blue like that. They would�ve been teasing it for weeks prior. They teased �Know Your History� for an entire month all for some lame, inconsequential dash to the stadium"
"I didn't mention that, I'm talking about adding content that's in the game for fuck knows how long  


EDIT: I didn't see, not going to pretend I didn't act like an ass"
"I�ve been waiting since the Soap bundle was found inside the game files, it was shown on CODTracker, and now the blueprints that are in the bundles for Soap and Sparks are in WZ. I would have imagined they would have been released before S2 but I guess we will see if they actually still care ab the MW player base today"
"Oh yeah they removed the WZ blueprint drops lmao

They were supposed to be released on S1 as the mastery emblems say ""Season 1"""
We got the answer and Raven doesn�t care about the modern warfare players.
"The ""warzone report"" thing is also lame af. Why do I have to make a Twitter account to see my stats? Really? Can't it just be on their website?"
"Exactly, they can't even do the most basic things

Like, all of the content besides the zombies event was made by IW anyways. All they had to do was implement it. If they didn't know how to, they could've had just a couple of meetings to ask how to do it. But no, let's ass-hand it"
"> They even got the damn date wrong 

Except Warzone released on March 10th, 2020? So the anniversary was yesterday like it says in the image, not today, the 11th?"
"Ouf  


Even worse tbh"
I sort of expect the zombie event to end and a ST pat's day thing to start. Probably a fresh new update coming sometime soon for that too.
"Modern Warfare really needs to be treated better. Black Ops sucks so much. I was thinking about buying it after playing Zombies for free, but the MP is such a huge step down from MW."
"They don�t need to treat anything better,MW has run it�s lifecycle,get over it"
"It's like they said ""let's take a step back"" and jumped off a building instead"
I think Tom Henderson said it will happen when the new warzone map drops around 11 or 12pm eastern time  when the zombie countdown thing is over
Tommy boy was wrong again. Looks like third time isn�t the charm.
Yeah usually if there's anything new it's always after the daily update. It's 6pm in the UK
"It's literally him who said the nuke is not happening after this event ends. When the zombie countdown is over, the zombies will just spread over Verdansk  


EDIT: What? I just googled his twitter, idunno"
"""One year: Thank you- Now stop playing MW and go buy CW you fucking sheep. You assholes were supposed to stop playing MW a long time ago, but here you are- even after everything we've done to kill MW. So thanks for that.""  


They don't even mention MW in this BS message- only Warzone and CW shit. But haha, ""where we droppin boyz?"" wow so relatable! They are so on our level guys!"
"Best part is that there's more intel on it on the internet, than the game itself.  


It's like Raven removed the old intel bc they didn't want people to see they're incapable of adding new ones lmao"
I like how everyone ignored this post until the update hit lol
"There is a big update coming, I've seen leaked files, just wait you'll get it"
All of this sub and half of the earth's population might have seen the leaked files by now
I didnt know the pavks actually did something. Does it only affect mp or campaign to?
yeah I've had the same problem... no way of fix at this point
I�ve noticed that if I uninstall pack 2 and keep pack 3 the game looks twice as good
"Pack 3 definitely makes those operators at the menu screen look great. Sunglasses texture looks really nice in particular. 

Lots of issues with the packs though. All the hi-res packs plus the multiplayer packs, auto uninstall themselves once a week-ish."
"Yeah I have the same issue. Once I installed Texture Pack 3 it now says Texture Pack 2 is uninstalled. I have seen a good number of other people on this subreddit reporting the same issue, so this is a widespread issue. I don�t think there�s anything we can do other than wait for IW to fix it."
I think pack 3 is actually overwriting pack 2. As I have seen a massive difference between just 2 installed verses just pack 3.

High resolution just means they raise the max texture resolution. It isn�t affected by video display resolution.  For example it may raise the Xbox max texture res from 1024 to 2048. You�ll notice it more with 1080p than on 720p but thats just because you�ll have a clearer picture.

You can
"It is possible, yes. Every time I needed *x* kills per match to unlock either a gun or a skin, I immediately left after reaching the sufficient amount of kills."
"If I'm not going to cook it, then yes, I would freeze my cod and leave it alone too.

For real now, I do think uninstalling and reinstalling would work. My friend has done it so many times for the space to play other games. He hasn't lost anything.

"Forgot to mention I�ve confirmed the download of these packs each time, hardly anything else to do with 40 gigs to download. They appear in my recently installed, then remove themselves from the list once they auto-delete themselves."
EoL
That's sad to hear. Did I miss this info in some patch notes?
"Wait did they remove yours or have you just used all of yours up? I still have like 120 something, I never really could get into the little trials that were offered. Tried some in season 0 when game was released bit they just weren't my thing. Too bad there was never a way to use these for something else"
"I already used all before season 1 or 2 of cw/wz integration but I am still missing some mission on the tab ""Black ops 1"""
"I'm getting every game like this somedays. Its frustrating and I feel like quiting for a while. But then again, had a few games recently where no one had a mic and the whole thing ran so smooth, like instinctive teamwork! COD works in mysterious ways i guess."
"I dunno it just irritates the living hell out of me because it's been like this for me ever since shoot the ship left, I've tried all game modes and yeah every now and then I'll get a decent match but 9/10 times it's just trash, either my teammates don't know what an objective is or you gotta go hunt the whole enemy team because there camping only to die anyways because there in some random corner with a 725"
"For me, in most cases, it has been like that. I think it has to do with SBMM. If you play objective, you get punished by getting put into teams with guys not doing so. 

Literally every game is like that. 

If I'd do it likewise and treat Hardpoint and Dom as a tdm, I'd lose every game. 

This has to be their matchmaking. It's frustrating as hell."
"It just tilts the hell out of me because either way it's a loss, and I even tried s&d because I got tired of either being the only one going for objectives or having a camp match with the enemy team, and on s&d it was the same exact situation, my team was headless chickens ignoring the objective and running bomb into the enemy's spawn basically. And it just irritates me so much because this only occurred after the latest shoot the ship got taken away so now any game mode I play is complete bs, tdm ends up being a camping match, domination is a camping match, demolition I ended Up justing getting spawn camped the whole time, hard point was mainly all snipers just hard scoping  and so on"
"I mean, I know why people do it in most gamemodes - to grind camos. At the end of the day, people don't care about winning - they just want to do their camo challenges. I'm guilty of this too.

I don't really know why they'd do it in SnD though, since SnD is terrible for getting camos."
"I mean I get the whole camo thing as Im doing it also which is why I'm so irritated because I'm just trying to use things like the sa87 or whatever but it's happening in game modes that makes zero sense, like who hops on demolition,snd or cyber attack to camo grind"
"This happens to me like 90% of my matches. It was so bad to that point that me and a friend both had 20+ confirms each on Kill Confirmed while the rest of our team was jerking off in corners doing nothing, and no they weren�t even getting kills for us, dropped a 30 bomb while they weren�t even in double digits."
"Same here, when my team ignores the objective they do horrible anyways, IDK why people don't understand that you get more kills when you actually do the objective because for example with domination if you capture the flags the enemy team will come and try to stop you meaning you don't have to go hunt them down. It's just so dumb because my team ends up letting the enemy team get the objective and the games over in like 2 minutes"
"""Don't worry, Farah! I have chicken nuggets to spare. They're delicious.""

Can I get a lower price?

Exactly their though process
There�s hope for GenZ
unlucky lol
Reverse? What I think really happened here is that he stacked your +4
"Don�t download special ops, survival or campaign"
"I think that is all. If you don't want to play story or Spec ops/survival, skip those packs. It should be labeled for each branch of the game. If you want to play the others, go for it. Spec ops is...ok from time to time for me. As for the story, it is ok, but not great. You do earn things from playing them, but if you don't want the operators or anything, just skip it for the most part."
"It will always exist. Somehow, seems to be more profitable from a executive pov"
"but WHY? sure, shitters will play with shitters and thats GREAT. but why does EVERYONE in my game have to be a fucking crack pot? Can't like.. half of them be? I'm not asking the other half to be shitters, just not super sweats that force me to TRY in a FUCKING GROUND WAR LOBBY. I dont want there to be 0 skill factor involved when the matchmaker does its thing, just make it like how a casual game mode in any other game does it. It feels like im playing a ranked game when theres NO FUCKIN RANKED MODE AVAILABLE"
Ok let's pretend that guy looks somewhat legit
"The ole punch the air and kill someone behind you trick, classic"
"Just got outplayed, plain and simple."
better gaming chair
It�s almost like the deaths I get when the dude jumps around the corner but he�s facing a totally different way from me
I like the instant report
I was big mad.
May I ask what�s wrong with this video? I�m confused.
He hit the air but killed him instead...who was behind the dude hitting the air
i call full hacks on that BS
"this is due to the client-to-server prediction system they have for CoD to make lag look more smooth, which means you will see this a lot. What also happens is you'll see characters looking/pointing their gun in a completely different direction than where you stand, but also get hit by magic bullets. This system has done more harm than good in my opinion. Just think how many times someone with bad latency appeared to pull some of this stuff off, then that player goes and reports him :/ it's a shame cause I can almost guarantee people were reported because of it. This makes decision skills very important for wanting results on cheaters who actually cheat and are reported. This skews the true results of people who cheat. which means more work to decipher for the devs. personally, Just let people look like they have high ping and skip around, at least then we know what the problem is, and a solution can be applied.

&#x200B;

I bet on his end, this looked like he was behind you and you were the one facing away from him. Remember, your kill cam is the data in which \*\*you\*\* sent to the servers, so what you're seeing in the kill cam feed is still from your first encounter."
But....I wanna be mad tho.
what's his acti ID?
Does anything ever come from reporting?
"Shadow bans, but this is legit someone just has REALLY BAD ping. Like absolutely awful ping. Might be pinging, or a glitch. But can�t tell as being good on mouse and keyboard could take 2 months at most. I can do some incredible flicks and precision and have only been playing for a month. On that guys screen the player was most likely in front of him at the time (bad ping) hence why he started shooting so late. So the guy definitely has terrible ping."
"Lmao at all of you who think this is cheating. This is just the quality of the MW netcode. If you pay attention to the video you can see that the guy or the server is having network issues.

Fucking snowflakes man. I cringed when I saw the instant report but what else do I expect from a person with an obsidian MP5.

I am shocked by how unaware people are of this game's issues."
I wish I were as cool as you.
This is the kind of comment I�d expect from someone who makes 3D models of opscore helmets.
You never see it anyway.
Not that specific skin obv as it was beta. But there�s another woods operator/skin sets
Is it in a mw pack?
Nope it�s gone for good
It says he�s included with Digital Edition for me. (PS4)
"It's not pre-order exclusive, the reason you didn't get if you did buy bocw is a bug since release not granting bonus content on purchase.

If you do have Cold War, just contact activision with proof that it shows it's available in the shop in modern warfare, and that the bonus content shown includes the Woods operator bundle, it's what I did

&#x200B;

They try to make up an excuse saying it's a ""One time exclusion"" but don't believe them."
Well I thought of that but I can�t find anything on Xbox to prove it
Could you send a picture of it on your shop to me while it�s not listed on Xbox or not that I can find it�s listed on other platforms I�m sure and I haven�t seen exclusive platform content so it would at least be reasonable information to back me up
Try restarting the Xbox sometimes it won�t read the disk right
I tried everything except re downloading the game. I�d rather buy the game again (if I was that desperate to play it) than wait a week to download the game with my 8mbps connection.
check the disc content is installed that was the problem for cause the same happened
"Same thing happened to my friend. A fresh uninstall and then reinstall fixed it after he downloaded the MP packs. But I see from your comment that you would rather not uninstall because of a slow connection so I guess there's not really an alternative. Just bear in mind that if the issue with the game is an error in the files that requires a reinstall, then simply buying it again won't fix anything. You would literally need to download it all again anyway except now you'll be out of another 60 dollars."
"That�s true... well I guess I�ll stick to CW. I just wanted to hop on for a couple games anyway, just to level stuff up for Warzone. To me it�s not worth my time or money at this point."

This happened to me as well except I got logged out and wasn't able to log into my activision account since the email wasnt recognised.

Can confirm. 99% of the cross hairs the guy was covering. Only thing that wouldn�t of 1 shot that is maybe the mk2 or dragonov since they�re hitmarker city.
that was crispy biscuits
This bloke thumped that chode.
Interesting spr setup +rep
May i ask what gun are you using ?
Spr
Whats the deal here? You mad your controller died on you?
"Lmao, I'm not going to uninstall my game just felt like using that as the title."
"Why would you not buy a game just because it has no new content. This game has tons to keep you occupied till the next cod drops. 

I got Damascus and some obsidians and still play every day."
"I would def buy it if there was dedicated server support. Once people stop playing the game, its dead. You can't boot up custom maps with your friends, stuff like that. I would say yes to $20, but $40+ for a game that is not getting any bug fixes, or additional content I suggest against"
It is a ton of fun but I will warn you cw and mw play so differently ot will be a change till you get used to it
I might also buy it
Like I don't wanna be buying games left and right but mw 2019 scratches my animator and sound design itches so I might just do it
"also if you do end up buying whats ur gamertag, we can hop in together"
"I mean if you like Cold War then you would most likely enjoy mw. So yea go for it. I personally don�t like either game much, but the camo grind keeps me in em. Have fun."
Just be aware if anything happens to your account you wont get any support from them.
"Noted, Ive watched jev I understand"
"i have purchased the game, im excited to hop into the action as an epic army man"
"If u like objective modes such as dom and hardpoint for some reason quick play are having a nice map rotation, so hopefully you will experience shoot house :)"
"Yes. If you feel like you'd enjoy it.

It isn't getting updated anymore, but there's more than enough content to keep you occupied for a good while.

I never got Damascus camo on MW, so after getting bored of CW pretty quickly, I came back, and I'm on the grind. I find lobbies instantly, the game is still fun. Fun is subjective though. I prefer this game to CW personally, though CW is decent."
"Compared to MW, CW is like that free to play chinese knock-off version you played when you were poor. So go for it, it's great!"
"Yeah fr lmao but the thing is it's dumb fun at least, mw for me is like a fast paced version or r6 which I actually love to death with it's emphasis on detail and gunplay"
"I just bought it, it has alot of content and it's enjoyable to play with the homies matter as well take full advantage of the discount"
"Fax, what's ur gamertag? I'd be down to hop in with you"
No
Can�t believe you bought CW and not MW. If you like CW you can only go up from there bro
Bruh my friends were getting it so it was logical to get the newest cod game
Yes just buy the game is epic
Not worth it.  Hacker go 85/5 in ground war. There is no proper anti cheat.
"I've gotten a score like that a few times doesn't mean were hacking, but theres defo a lot of hackers and blatant wall hackers in gw"
Be sure to buy the game.
MW is the better cod game and still dont have an issue finding lobbies.
   At this point no.  The game is just a big ad.
No. No new content. W8 for next mw

Yep. its gamer time"
"For some reason lately that's all it is for me and friends, as well as any pissed off randos that wanna get trashed a 2nd time lol. Doesn't matter if it's Comcast or FiOS, local or out of state. It's worse than laggy, it might say 80ms (even though 20ms is normal for me) but it's more like 200-300ms"
Public matches for me freeze up all the time.
"i've experienced this as well. i read custom games are not hosted on the servers anymore, but by the party leader now, which would explain the lag. can anyone confirm?"
"I think your right. I remember on pc you can click start DS. Which hosted the game on a server. I only see that option on Xbox but it was locked, not sure about PS"
Private matches are always laggy. I believe private patches use peer to peer so expect everyone but host to be laggy af.
Don't know how far your router but you can easily get a 50-100ft ethernet cable for like 25$ and less.
"Yep, just ordered a 100ft one"
"So I moved my router upstairs as well as hooked up the base Ethernet it came with and my god, the difference was night and day!!!"
Powerline adapter actually works pretty well so you don't need to tape an ugly cord around the house
"I�ve tried those, for some reason they don�t do"
I'm stuck at playing at 100ms and it is quite frustrating lol

highest kills on his side was 23. couldn't have been overlap.
Wait a minute what?
No way
How is this possible?
Knifer?
I mean I�ve unlocked platinum but it�s not my weapon of choice
XTRA DESTRUCTIOn
Yeah coldwar is a disaster. If I had to guess all the eggs are in the warzone basket w a potential new map
The only good thing about MW is the graphics and the animations. Everything else is gay
The only good thing about CW is the fact that it made me appreciate MW way more than I ever did
"i think doors,mapdesign and mounting spawned the campers

there seems to be more intense lobbies than it used to be tho, with 1-2 obvious tactical players and the others going crazy"
"funnily enough there are some campers who utilise none of these things, but literally just camp a dark corner or this rooftop on Hackney near A flag. I have no idea what's going through their minds"
Map design and lethality of the weapons with no recoil forces players to play slow. It�s exactly how the devs want the game to be.
12 year olds...
I agree 100% like what the fuck is so fun about sitting in a corner of a room?
Throwing knives at people.
"In MW its very easy to gloss over a motionless target bc thats how the brain works, and the skins in MW are generally color neutral like all the maps so sitting still makes you practically invisible to someone who�s playing the game with a run and gun mentality. My biggest weakness in MW was target acquisition, I just wouldn�t be able to see the guy hiding in a corner until I could see the muzzle flash. CW has nameplate/healthbar reveal which is why camping doesn�t work as well; instead imo the sniping is WAY to fukn easy, if you play snipers only people can just quickscope you at pointblank range even while you�re jumping and sliding which is bs."
"I don't have the same issue. Anytime I hop on, it's a rather steady paced match."
"Same. I switch to CW and it�s way campier. 

Maybe it�s just my lobbies, but there�s almost no campers for me. Maybe 1 every 5-6 games, but the rest are fun.

If people are camping, I pull out a wall bang build, or grab an RPG/thermite to kill them."
It's the map design. Every time you walk out in the open you might get beamed from anywhere . It's risky to move so most people would rather crouch walk from cover to cover.
I love players like you that just keep running into my claymores and 725 and then rage quit and start a post like this. It brings me joy lol. It's players like you that have helped me maintain my 3.23 KD in MW and 3.64 KD in CW. Just keep running into my double claymores with your EOD.
I made a friendly joke about Satan that hurt a camper :)
"My god this part, so true. So many ways to counter and the mfs pick EOD and running straight into the Claymores. Gotta admit I used to be one of them, but ain't it the good ole trial and error that lets us excel, huh? (Hacking lethals has never felt so good before omfg)  


It's just one braincell apart from actually learning and writing a millionth rant about it on this sub"
"Lol camping has always been a thing in COD. As long as there are kids playing, there will be campers. Played a 10v10 TDM game recently where a guy sat in a building watching a doorway all game. He went like 3-1 in a 10 minute game. 

In my experience camping is pretty rare though. Like I see one every few games, whereas back in the MW2 days it was practically half the lobby. MW feels a lot more rushy than the original CODs, especially with slide cancelling, bunny hopping etc.

I find the best way to deal with campers is just get good enough to kill them even if they surprise you. Campers are generally pretty bad at the game, so they have shit reaction times and accuracy."
"Sure, campers just materialised out of thin air because of MW"
nobody claimed that. But there seems to be something that either attracts campers or makes people more likely to camp
Aug? smh. Nice win tho
I agree bro I ain�t proud of myself but I can�t use my kilo in this state. They do this every season. Once it gets a nerf I won�t be Meta whoring anymore
"How original aug ffar. 

Anyways that�s badass that you actually got them with that though almost everytime I use a precision I hit nothing because they run or outsmart the planes direction. Nice dub!"
"Whoa congrats on that, that�s mental"
what gun were u using
Striker. Anime skin
"What I'd do is:  
Right click sound icon >> Open Sound Settings  
App volume and device preferences  
Set everything to default  


Next go to:   
Windows Key >> Type ""Sound Control Panel""  
Under 'Playback', ensure your headphones are set to ""Default Device""  


Other than that I can't really think of anything, unless your headset has an app to control it's own settings"
"Thanks for the reply.  
Unfortunately I have already tried this to no avail.  
  
MW is the only place where this issue pops up and it only happen since the last patch.  
  
My headset doesn�t have an app to control it.  
  
I guess I�ll just uninstall and wait for the next update.  
  
Cheers"
"Good luck getting an answer. I play on an Xbox and 90% of the time when we are playing multi-player split screen the game crashes just as it's about to put us in a map. Takes a good 10 minutes to reboot the system only to have it crash again. Very frustrating and a waste of our family time.  I posted on here and never got feedback that anyone cares or is on it. I think the COD developers don't care about the split screen peeps like me because even on the updates nothing improved.

My friends say it happens on their systems with this game too.

We play Hardcore mode."
"Ah. I don't know how to solve that, but good luck to you. If you know a better place for me to ask this question, let me know please. Have a good day"
I�ve always restarted my ps4 and then it fixes itself every time if you haven�t tried that already

#YegorGang
It would go even better on shirtless Yegor!   Swing it!
"thanks, I hate it."
Wouldn�t it go better with that vitas? Just saying.
Brilliant!
I had a similar issue. Turns out it was my discord overlay conflicting with MSI afterburner. I disabled the discord overlay and it�s good
"Someone had similar problem. They were running mutimonitor setups, are you?"
Yeah I got two hooked up
"This is usually what happens when the game detects software it deems to be suspicious. Either running, or dormant on your hard drive. 

Do you have any cheat engine or modding tools downloaded?

Are you running any overlays?

Any gaming mice/keyboard that came with special software?"
"Thermal paste old? A stretch, but I was getting pretty much identical symptoms on mine, and redoing the paste sorted it out."
Could be
"At 26 seconds it shows that I have the Holo sight, 5mw lazer, lightweight trigger, rubberized grip tape, muzzle break, and forge tac barrel."
You can always stop my guy.
Just uninstalled.
"Gunfight only.

But, have the same problems with maps, more or less."
"Personally never had a problem with guns but maybe it's because I'm using the meta, I wouldn't know because I don't look up what the meta is, I agree on the maps being absolutely shit in visibility. In gunfight if you ever play in Hill and someone hides in a bush you can consider yourself dead"
"No problem.

The meta is: CR-56 AMAX, AS Val, MP5, MP7, R9-0, SP-R 208."
The maps and the fact there is no mini map are the worst parts
No minimap what you mean
"Not sure if you�re into it, but the maps for the most part all play really well on search. The meta guns are definitely a thing, but I find playing hardcore allows for more variety in weapon choice"
"AK actualy is way nastier then the Amax, amax has alot of range caps and loses 3 shot chest  and 2 shot headshot  at 35+ meters while the AK.. well.. lets just say it has no range cap.

&#x200B;

at 27+ meters it drops off but stays a 3 shot to the chest (at an impressive 38 damage per shoot too, and even a 2 hit headshot at 51 per shot)

&#x200B;

AK has a 545 fire rate and amax 630, so while in CQC the amax will outshine the AK, the AK has the big advantage after the range drop hits.

&#x200B;

Amax also has horrible visual recoil on the ironsight."
i have the same issue man
Have you tried equipping stopping power rounds? I swear I have taken people down with a shot in the hand using an spr 208 with stopping power rounds and Lapua mags.
"I have not, I'll have to try that!"
"In the leg, no."
Stoping power all bolt action sort of weapons can one shot both matter what with stoping power.
"Playing in Hardcore mode, makes all sniper and marksmen rifle one shot; depending on build that is..."
Nothing reddit? Is this even reddit anymore?
You can press R3 over their username and a list of reasons to report will pop up. It�s unlikely that anything will happen though.
It's pretty appalling how many kids in here think this is acceptable behaviour
Yeah. Must say im quite surprised
"It's cod lol
Cod has always been like this."
Message that kid and tell him you love him and let him know that he's a great person.
Good idea
"Don't be a crybaby
This is cod"
just because its cod doesnt mean you should just let people get away with horrible stuff though.
that sucks but I mean it's cod what do you expect.
Lol you wouldn�t have lived through the MW2 days.
Does saying that make you feel like a big strong man?
I play with my bois and if anything it increases the competition.
Same. My friend always talks shit when I kill him.
Since when is playing a game mode with your friends cheating?
Well technically in a ffa you can cheat by boosting one of your friends but
[deleted]
It makes it more intense between them. Me and my friends see who can win first while screwing each other over
Low recoil high fire rate
I also feel like the MP7 flinches ppl more because of the faster rate of fire too.
"Honestly, it has somehow felt weaker to me lately. I like the high cap mags, clean irons, and controllable recoil.  It's a nice option for getting SMG longshots. But, as others may be pointing out, people just have a thing for it"
"Speaking from past experiences, the MP7 has been in high regard since its debut in MW3. I have so many memories of the gun and it�s a decent weapon. I based my opinion on nostalgia and some might agree with me"
Mw3 and bo2 mp7 were the best and I�ve missed it so much that it was the first gun I got gold for and obsidian.
"Mobility, mag size, stability, rapid fire. I just find it easier to control than the mp5 and Val. I hardly use it, only really when I play core (like Livestock). Hit markers can be frustrating so sometimes I switch to the fennec"
"I use it in WZ and practice in MW, it's 60 rounds and low recoil allow bots like me to be able to get kills."
"It's pretty much the only weapon I use in MP (Have like 6K kills with it and the weapon in second place has 1.6K) 
and I just like it a lot because the mobility lets me play super-fast especially once I get dead silence procced. I pretty much have my gunsmith setup for max mobility

The fire-rate also lets you kill people who get the jump on you first a lot of the time, which is aided by the low-recoil letting you beam people in the head.

I understand the issue with Hitmarkers though, mid-long range becomes a pain with how many bullets you have to put into people but as long as you hit the head mostly, it's not too bad."
"I mostly run Smgs and the formula I worked out is, mp5 on small maps (vacant, gun runner (although it�s iffy sometimes run mp7), Cheshire, harbor, shoot house) and I use the mp7 on medium maps) you just gotta be quick with it."
"High RPM and relatively low recoil.

its the BF4 version of K10"
I like the clean iron sights the mobility and most of all it shreds in hardcore shipment which is what I play cause I�m a crackhead who only cares about kills
I have no problems with it. One of my 10 classes is an mp7 class.
It has good recoil control too
"Nah it's not everyones thing. Its like the M13 some people swear by it and some hate using it, it's just a taste thing. Personally I like running it because it has no recoil and a decent ttk but I wouldn't say it's in the top tier of guns."
"Mono sub

FFS Recon barrel

Tac laser

Commando foregrip

50-60 round mag/or sleight of hand

True that it gets a lot of hitmarkers at range if you hit mostly body/limbs. But Its accuracy is great with very little horizontal and vertical recoil. 

MP7 can laser passed 50 meters if your aims on point.
Also even putting heavy attachments on it its ads speed still shines IMO."
"High mobility and good headshot ttk, that's basically it. Just beam people's heads with the straight vertical recoil while jumping like you're Michael Jordan and the gun is upper tier, though still below MP5 and AUG

Also, screw the As Val. That gun is the same as tattooing ""Douchebag"" to your forehead. Just don't"
"It was the #2 SMG before Cold War. It use to be like the MP5 but with a slightly lower rate of fire but with a better damage range profile and clean sites. However since cold war, time to kill has gotten so short. MP7 5th now after mac10, mp5�s, ffar, Val, and mac10 again."
"If activision disable aim-assist. All cod players on console will never get smg as weapon. Cuz w/o aim assist, that weapon and cod players on consoles - trash"
yea no shit lol they're literally aiming with one finger meanwhile kb+m players can aim w their whole arm

What price?
"�37.49

annoyingly i saw it on sale for �29.99 on battle.net a few months back and didn't bite then

at 29.99 i prolly wouldn't even question but for near 40 i dunno if i'm just so bored of lockdown that i'm desperate for more games"
I still play it a lot. I don�t ha e any trouble getting into matches. I say go for it.
Worth it.
I bought it the other day and easy to find lobbies because of crossplay.
"I just came on here to ask the same question.  Only thing that was sort of holding me back is if people will still be playing ot in a year or longer.  

I have seen so many people say they played Cold War but ended up going back to Modern Warfare.

Ive went on twitch a few times in the past week and almost every time I see Modern Warfare having more people playing it than Cold War.

I'm definitely pulling the trigger on MW :)"
"Best cod in a while, and considering many youtubers still have gameplay videos as their background over their commentary I�d say it�s still very much in the public spotlight. Thst is not even to talk about how many people still play the multiplayer which is A LOT. Probably still one of the most played MP games (and that�s excluding wardrobe).
The campaign is also worth the price of admission, maybe alone.
The ONLY part that maybe lacking the spec ops (coop) portion, since that the layer base seems to have dwindled down after last summer. This is a problem since you need to match with 3 other people to play. They were fun as hell too, if you need a squad I�d definitely be down to play them again."
"Be sure to buy the game.
I enjoy game everyday.
And have no problem with game and playerbase."
"Ram 7 - Mono suppressor, commando foregrip, stippy, ads stock, and slight of hand
Easy beams"
isnt that just a more fancy M4 stat wise?
"I use amax with semi auto rounds, mono, commando, thermal, longest barrel"
I use the worst ads spr and a deagle with long barrel and muzzle brake or whatever it�s called
"Striker-Fast Ads attachments, suppressor, and extended mags. Go to hardcore and enjoy a one-shot smg from pretty much all ranges that matter."
"Bizon/deagle

Bizon: monolithic, 8.7 inch steel barrel, 84 round mags, skeleton stock, and rubberized grip tape.

Deagle: cronen optic, longest barrel, monolithic, 13 round mags, lightweight trigger.

I also run a fennec that�s good in HC. Deadshot barrel, GI mini reflex, semi auto rounds, SoH, and the aiming stability stock. It one shots through wood walls, and I�ve got a clip on my account from today that shows me using it."
"Kilo with 100 rd mags, flash guard, bipod, no stock, and the shortest barrel"
"Chainsaw finn w/ the ads rapid fire barrel, sniper scope, tac laser and mono suppressor. On hardcore i burn through people like warm butter. It's only good close quarters but still really fun."
why the sniper scope.. doesnt that just give you super slow ads? and a glint..?
"all ADS attachments on the Oden, sometimes put the dick compensation suppressor if I'm feeling sneaky  


It has a terrible rate of fire, so every missed shot means a lost gunfight. Then again it's a 2 hit kill most of the time. Helps me get better follow up shots with other guns, no idea why I like it... Oh yeah because it's an upsized Groza pretty much. Which by itself is a bullpupped AK lol, and I recently fell in love with this neanderthal-friendly rifle  


Fuck META  


All my homies hate META"
"5.45 AK still holds up pretty well most things considered.

&#x200B;

and with a nice blueprint combo it looks clean."
Try throwing explosive rounds on too. The reactions are even better
i have seen him and other like him before.  they are advertising the 'level 1000' and all the guns / shop items for sale. shocking stuff.
They will never get rid of cheaters.
idk where you live but in the us its the 10th
Was just about to say this. Maybe tomorrow they�ll get it?
he�s from the future lmao
"�Bet you feel dumb�

*looks at calendar*

Yeah mate I think you�re the dumb one."
Um Australia.
"Despite still being March 10th (in europe at least), I don't really think they give us new content tomorrow...not the new operators or the 3 new MW guns or the nuke event nor the new WZ map...As a MW MP player mostly i care only about the guns (not too much about sparks and soap's cousin shampoo...)...We have just to sit tight and wait bor BO Trash War Season 2 to end before we see anything new for MW/WZ..."
What a shitpost.....
In a world where everybody has a calendar in their hand and you can't even manage to work out what day it is hahahaha
It�s March 11th where I live buddy
It will be Friday morning for those in Australia. Wait for the Outbreak event to end first...
"We�re still a day away, but you will be able to post this tomorrow. This leaker has been wrong twice. Guys pulling random Thursdays out of his ass around the start and middle of the seasons. 

First it was December 10. The. It was the midseason update in January. Now it�s the day after WZ anniversary. 

Then when it doesn�t happen, he�ll delete his tweet like he always does and claim �it was supposed to release I don�t know why they delayed it�"
Hahaha
"Don't know why people thought there would be a surprise drop. Any update would be pretty clearly advertised beforehand 

I low-key don't think there will be a new WZ map until COD2021 but idk"
Best part is that the leaker is the game itself lmao
Y�all are gonna look real dumb tomorrow. Just saying.
"I dont think so but i hope they deliver, i really wanna use the new weapons."
I read from a popular leaker that that�s all going to release with a Modern Warfare 3 Campaign remastered release in early April
Hopefully I love slow fore lmgs. The m60 and gorgan are my favorite weapons in cod history
Do you like the base finn lmg
Not really just some new event like the outbreak thing but I'm hopeful we get some bundles
I think so
The new system is so u can lvl on all parts of the game in uniform. They have always rotated out playlists way before cw came out that isn�t anything new.
"IMO, i prefer the Livestock moshpit 4v4, it's super fun.

As said by someone else the leveling systems are now synced between CW, MW and WZ so you can play either game and level up your seasonal rank/battlepass, which i like, as i can still progress my rank while playing MW."
You forgot to install CS:S
"GPU*

Try reinstalling the shaders from graphics settings, if this didn't help, reinstall the GPU drivers and if that didn't work try DDU uninstalling.

Here how to do the DDU reinstalling: https://youtu.be/bP-2B14Nckw


I hope it works fine!"
thx
"You�ve just entered the matrix, that is all."
Did you install those shaders?
"If it's happening all the time then your graphics card is either too dusty, or it's dying, or both. If it's rare then that's not too bad. GPU's crash sometimes."
If it was for a single match (or until you restarted the game) then its definitely the game. This game often has graphical issues and glitches. If this is happening to you all the time then its your graphics card dying.
"Seems like a driver issue. Use DDU and clean install newest ones available. Next, fully install shaders, and let me know whether this issue has been resolved. :)"
"So you're on PC? I can't really help there but I'm assuming you're hardwired and have a decent router? What are your qos options? And if there are none, are you on a DSL connection or cable? And how much available bandwidth? I know it's the only option for rural areas. Believe me, I've been there. lol."
"Yeah I�m on PC, I have a pretty solid WiFi card in my computer connected to a 5GHz WiFi extender and it runs like a breeze, except for on MW. I�m not too good with the technicality of WiFi but all I know is it�s just MW it happens on. Not CW or Warzone and I�m really stumped, I thought it might be to do with the game itself maybe??"
[deleted]
That's what I thought at first but both are fine :/
"I had this same issue. But for me, it was a hardware limitation. Somehow with previous updates, the game has been getting more demanding based on the in-game scale that it shows you under the graphics options setting. Even though I never had issues before, I had to start running graphic textures on medium."
I know why Read the username
Yeah the game freezes and crashes every time I play anything now since the update a few nights ago. (Pc)
Do you know any solution?
If you have calling cards and emblems set to random try taking it off. sounds crazy but this fixed crashing issues back when cw season 1 launched an it�s worked for multiple people I�ve suggested it to on this sub. Let us know if it works
It�s in all public modes it seems. Seems to correspond with the Cold War sale again.
"Yea my game is crashing when i play it as well, started happening after a driver update tho"
Sad to say ur acc has been hacked then
Amazing
"the sames just happened to me right now my man, trying to figure out an answer"
Sorry this happened to you bro. I tried to do the account recovery thing on their website but it says I might have to wait 10 business days. F this. Let me know if you figure something out
"Sounds like you got hacked, could be wrong but I don�t think you can play online w out an activision account"
thats what I was thinking aswell. I have days of playtime on this game from before so I must have had an activision account right? But the game OR the website didnt even recognise my email adress

Morse code for help I�m dead
My thoughts as well
Lmao
"It�s the ladder btw.
If they are killed on the ladder the gripping rungs animation never stops."
Cool I had no idea lol
omg thats an insane smop!
their hands are itching to respawn and take the control..
"look, imma crab"
Zombies are coming.
Hi I'm here for the gangbang
"Yep. Waiting on a fix from IW but it effects other people in the game too, I think it disbands the entire lobby/game each time"
Oh okay thanks man
Yeah it�s what happens when you use the Mac-10. Called virgin try hard hand.
"at first i downvoted but after a thinkin about the countless times i died to that no skill gun, you earned a upvote."
The mac-10's rate of fire is so high that it melted your operator's hand.
It only happens when you use a CW gun and post it in the MW subreddit

"Using a headset helps a lot.

This is probably my most suspicious clip yet though.

Coincidentally, I got my fennec golden that game.

If you feel like looking through all my clips, they�re all on my Xbox account, with the same username as my Reddit account."
"I�ve never seen better map awareness damn man, everything from footsteps to looking at the mini map and movement"
"Thanks. I�ve been improving over time.

MW is actually my first FPS game, so I had to get used to it for a while.

Over the 250+ hours I�ve been playing, I�ve started to get better, as this clip shows."
"Wall Hax overachiever

For real, I wouldn't want to be your opponent"
"Are you being serious, or sarcastic? Hard to tell sometimes.

If you�re being serious, this is on Xbox, with a controller.

If not, sorry for the misunderstanding."
Pretty good but why the thermal sight? Isn�t it just blocking ur view if ur only using the reflex
"Was going for challenges, and it also helped some of the game since people were using smoke grenades."
Pretty good. I'm not surprised getting shot through the wall on Hardcore. The guys commenting are hardcore sweats who can't sit still for 0.3 seconds. You did good. Nice gameplay.
"Thanks! My journey in MW has come far(this is my first FPS game), from corner camping with a 725, to using other weapons that take more skill, and doing this kind of thing."
"Only available in BOCW and Warzone, not in MW2019 MP"
"Ah, right on. Cheers man"
"It�s a weapon for Warzone and Cold War only, not in MW though"
"Sweet, thanks for the info!"
It's a warzone/cw gun cant use it in mw
"Cheers my dude, appreciate you"
"here's the magnum loadout for anyone interested and the link to the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTM3hzG81HOdQw9hDAQFa3w)

Lockwood pistol scope, Stippled Grip Tape, LW trigger, Sleight of Hand, ADS laser

pistol scope is purely for the aesthetic, a more optimal loadout would be to use the iron sights for sure"
NICE
<3
The one on crash was just painful
"yup, dude missed a lot, think he had to reload at the end lol"
Any Hardcore match on a small map. I did a bunch of grinding on shoothouse and shipment.
Appreciate it
"Uh... I unlocked it accidentally, i didn't even knew there was a challenge for the gun. My shot is wait for rust/shoothouse/shipment and go crazy with a r-90"
Orr you can try livestock
"HC TDT , just my suggestion"
"At the moment with shoothouse and shipment being not a quick game mode, the 4v4 farmhouse (livestock) one is a pretty decent option. You can die and still do it so if you grab a fast ar like a val or even just a well built m4 you can rip through people."
This is honestly the best answer to your question.  Otherwise stick to small maps in hardcore.
"If you play aggressive, it shouldn�t be too hard"
"I feel they blocked progression. Tried to unlock new LMG, but nothing comes out of it"
"I thought the same thing was happening to me.  Anyway, I'm going to take this as a good thing because it means that they should actually be released soon (tomorrow supposedly)!"
They blocked it and the reset the levels for it on everyone who had it unlocked for all the the unreleased guns.
Such a bummer for me; went through a lot of 2x tokens. But at least I have a feel for the gun I suppose.
I don�t even see on my game where you can even unlock either of those guns.
Only in survival not mp or wz
They locked the weapons recently and you can�t level them up now and they reset their levels too
They're finally available for multi-player??
"Nope, but you can unlock and rank them up in survivial."
he just accepted that this was his life now
He has accepted his fate
"The game is buggy mess after recent patch that gave nothing to Multiplayer yet still it broke the game. It goes the same for me, constant Dev errors. Random crashes, textures ain�t loading. Just wait for patch."
Yeah man it's crazy.  I never had any game breaking bugs before this
" Got this interesting bug last night. It took forever to load the map on the start of the match. Once it finished, it seemed as if the game just forgot to load in half of the assets. Doors for the containers, some walls, the blue barrels, and the forklifts didn't show up. I couldn't walk through them though. Does anyone have any insight as to what went wrong? It did it on the next match too, but once I quit and re-launched the game, it was working fine again. PC btw (Ryzen 7 3700x. Radeon rx 5700 xt)  

&#x200B;

Reposted because I messed the post all up the first time.  I deleted the first one."
"COD Time...

There's no escaping it.

There's no conquering it.

It plays by its own rules.

It knows where you are.

Bow to it. Pray to it. But do not curse it, for there is no time like COD Time.

Embrace it,...or your time will come.

Yes...this video pleases COD Time

>!COD Timing hath spoketh! You have been blessed with +2xCODTiming! For every COD timing moment in your favor, receive 2 more COD timing in the same match!!<"
"Lol I wish, mine would bounce off a wall and kill me"
I've been having shit ping as well recently
I�m more impressed by the GPU temp
With high tier coolers it's easy to do that. Dont even need a top of the line one
"Me: Goes in to have some fun

The enemy team:"
You really don't go easy on these guys do you
That's slick af. Mind if I ask what your load out looks like?
"Thanks, sure here:
https://imgur.com/a/VSVnnKW"
I would have thrown my controller at the wall if I was on the other team
I really love seeing a true quickscoper with an actual sniper rifle and not some cheesy toy gun.
"you are cracked, what settings and DPI you runnin? Also I want to know how you got you're aim to be so good and maybe how you found you're sensitivity?"
"Thank you very much, I really appreciate it

DPI: 500, sensitivity: 11.05

I play a lot of FPS games and started early in the gaming world, and with time and knowing the mechanics of each game, it helped me figuring out how to play.

And about finding the good spot for sensitivity, I just raised it until it felt comfortable to use, that's it."
Insane. Wouldn't want to go against you. Also respect for using AX and HDR over SPR and Kar.
"Thanks, appreciate it"
Typical PC/MKB play
What server is this on? Bitch
Sure would be nice to have map voting in MW not gonna lie... probably one of the dumber things they changed in this game
Honestly I can�t complain. It�s a good map once you get momentum
I�m over it. I just want the base maps back
"That and promenade do show up a lot. They're both *okay* but the problem is they're so repetitive. Every game plays the exact same

Airport, Port, Boneyard, Palace, Quarry, and Downtown are all way better"
"Is there a new fast movement hack?

I played this map last night, boots on the ground, so ATVs but nothing else.  At initial deployment, score 0-0, I ran to the A map, noticed that there was already a mine on the A flag, so I ran to the building towards the hillside/oob.  There were two mines in there and two opposing team players.  The one guy ended up with 56 kills, which is suspicious.  

I just have never seen another team cross the entire map before the A side even gets the A flag, especially without Helios."
Probably. Theres all sorts of new and stupid hacks being made for this game.
It's a hell of a lot better than promenade.
"It's easily the worst map in my opinion and shows that they got lazy and just plopped sections of Verdansk in a GW maps, where as early maps felt designed for GW and put in to Verdansk. 

Riverside is way too wide open to work in ground war. Huge wide open spaces work for WZ because you have more health and less player density. So lower odds you'll get melted stepping out of a house. You may get 10 people max in this area in WZ and 3 will be on your team. In GW you have 24 people trying to kill you. It really limits your options because trying to push requires you to stick to very precise paths in order to limit exposure."
"I think all of the GW maps were part of WZ, they just did a lot more beta testing before releasing them.  I've been playing GW almost exclusively since MW dropped (it was the reason I came back), so the first three maps are tired.  I still don't mind the city and the farm, but Karst is burned out."
"Better this than Karst River Quarry.  I'm on an OG XBox One, and that map is a guaranteed game-crasher."
The only ground war map I don�t like playing is Tavorsk district. Last night I had to leave the lobby 7 times in a row cause the game kept putting me into a Tavorsk District lobby. Like take a hint MW
Map rotation has been sucking bad recently
Yeah. Almost wants to make you just play Cold War
I wouldn�t go that far lol
I didn't even realise that you could put pointman on specialist
"It�s pretty good tbh, all those stun assists and plants/defuses add up for dead silence"

"Yeah man, it sucks."
"Solid advice.  I couldn�t tell you how many times I�ve heard opposition players get upset because I didn�t play how they wanted and make myself an easy target.  Rather, I played cautiously and took them out, which was all the better since I was using the riot shield or crossbow.  

Sure enough I was called a camper here and there, but I didn�t care because I wasn�t running every second out in the open.  However, I didn�t care.  I wasn�t camping, rather I looked at the situation and determined pushing was a bad idea.  I was better off waiting around the corner with my shield to take out my opponent as he ran around blindly.  In all maybe 15-20 seconds, so if that makes me a camper, give me some marshmallows, chocolate, and gram crackers because I�m making s�mores."
"Solid advice, imo this game plays exactly like MW2 and MW in terms of how you should move around the map now I've played on and off for a year.  


The SBMM can still suck a cock though, that heavily hides just how much like MW2 this game is sadly"
"Another way to get high streaks is (at least I'm objective modes) playing the first 3 minutes like a headless chicken, rushing your soul out straight into the enemy areas to collect as much info as you can. 

You saw 3 dudes camping the same spot with snipers? *Noted*. don't go there. 

Your enemy likes to rush b everytime? *Noted*. Camping b will be a useful way to start 

Everyone's using dragon breath? *Noted*. Must use EOD and once you have enough info, start playing strategically"
"i have a 2.4x k/d and what you wrote is literally the Bible on how to do decent.  


Im getting older'ish and i generally find that a nice warmup is to play hc (or core) vs like 9 bots by yourself to get my reflexes up and gets me used to not relying on teamates cause SBMM tries to balance in an objectively fair way, but not subjectively.  


Also map control is king, generally rushing into their spawn area might net you a few more kills, but it disrupts the flow for the whole team and you might find yourself in a bad situation overall, mainly speaking of Dom and TDM."
"That Spotter perk is a lifesaver. The camping still drives me nuts, however, not because I'm dying to them. I just hate that they slow the game down. But as far as competing with them, the Spotter perk nullifies campers.

Thanks for the recommendations bro."
"usually it's more useful to have shrapnel, so you can double c4 them out of their cozy little corners, even if they have eod"
"Yeah if you just focus on not getting caught off guard/in sprint, fall back when you need to reload, break line of sight if caught off guard, then you can streak pretty high. 

Now there�s ways to play aggressive but a lot of it relies on centering and shooting as fast as possible and movement. This will only get you so far though because if your team doesn�t have good control it�s very easy to get caught off guard or third partied while in a gunfight

My biggest tips is to know your weapons strengths and weaknesses, don�t fight outside of your gun range because that�s how you lose gunfights even if you play it right. And to know when you have to back off a fight. If someone pops up on a UAV coming from your back, disengage after putting pressure and cover the guy who thinks he�s caught you off guard"
Slow and steady beats hot and ready
o look another kid who's life depends on winning the game lel
Shows up for me too
"Other players don't see the correct emblem either. The reason you can see prestige emblems for other players is becuase the emblem shown is stuck at the point the player was at when they broke it. Those players in your screenshot are probably many prestige levels higher than the icon shown for them.

This problem has been here Since at least the Feb 4 patch. I've bug reported it and provided screenshots to activision support. 

I didn't buy MW until Feb 5. So, like you I'm stuck at recruit level icon even though I'm prestige 7 from BOCW."
"Strange, all my friends see the correct prestige emblem for me"
I�m not sure if it will or not tbh
At this point I'm hopeless
"""Improved anti-cheat system""

NON-EXISTANT (Warzone)"
"If they do come out soon, it will probably coincide with the general mid-season update to make up for the lack of substantial Cold War content (the ""new"" 6v6 map is just a rework of an existing map) and since we heard nothing about an update today i'm assuming we'll see that next week or the week after

the ISO was in the files for like a year before they put it in the game, so i have hope that those weapons will see the light of day, especially with blueprints already made for them"
U may be right. I really hope they do that. Cold war weapons r just irritating ruining every single game. Remember when the integration started it was all DMR DMR bullshit and now it's the FFAR and MAC 10. Man these weapons r literally killing this amazing game.
"Honestly this is the less convincing idea. It would be really weird if they decide to announce 3 weapons for modern warfare in the mid season of cold war. But hey,  dreaming is free"
Rumor for season 7 was March 11th the last I saw. Wasn�t officially announced and just speculation. So if it doesn�t drop tomorrow then you can pretty much give up on new content unfortunately
If tomorrow they doesn't announce it imma just buy the Alex deathstalker bundle and call it a fucking day
"People (myself included) are saying that their new weapon progression or unlocks have been reset.  It seems that is a good indicator that there will be a drop soon.  Fingers crossed that tomorrow is it.  However, no official announcement has been made to my knowledge."
"That's a good signal, i guess? But man i haven't unlocked the crossbow yet and if they reset my progress I'm gonna cry really damn loud"
"Obviously by ""the gamemode"" i mean warzone, but i couldn't add it or the post was going to be automodded"
they made an ingame post but that's all i saw. no mention of anything special
Well fuck. Alex deathstalker there we go
You can pick up the new blueprints as ground loot in WZ but I think you can only find the cx-9 and the RAAL not the sykov
Those are gone now.
Thursdays have been update days too... I've heard that Verdansk is Nuked for good too.
Hope the nuke it�s Downtown or Promenade first
"I guarantee you they will release eventually, when however, is a different story.

I say either today or in a week, but again im bot sure."
"Well, neither did a week ago and doesn't seem to be today lmao"
"I think they put most stuff out at 10pst, its only 830

Edit-ah yes, downvotes.  Sorry for trying to provide info I guess"
I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to wait until like October to get people switched back to modern warfare to buy the next game.
W.... What?
BRO HOW?!?
No gaming chair is the only logical explanation
You thinks that's bad try using the Kar98 you will suffer even worse lol. I tried to hold it but I wasn't strong enough to battle off the droves of sweatys while making the big iron kar
Honestly... still better than me lol
"My SPR class isn't designed for high damage but still, that's wild lol."
Well for one....that's not how you use a sniper....
"Yeah bro, sorry I wasn't prone at the back hardscoping with it.  I'll do that just for you."
But it�s not a sniper
"The weird thing is: We see this in Cold War a lot at the moment and people believe it's a glitch... I'm slowly beginning to believe this is more like a cheat. Health goes down to 5% and then people just don't die anymore. Doesn't matter what you do.

With cheating being as rampant and obvious as it is at the moment, I wouldn't be surprised if people just don't give a fuck anymore and use this cheat as well."
"I think it's the map designs. Back in MW2 days we had more open gun battles and they had nice combination of various game play styles. I can think of Favella, Quarry and Underpass being well done  maps before hackers came and ruined the game."
Yeah I think map design has something to do with it losing replay-ability. But it just seems like the whole play style of the game has shifted. Before you could run around and get in engaging gunfights but now it�s just campers and snipers everywhere
[deleted]
"Same man, exactly the same..."
"And the people that do run have a riot shield, a knife and are bloody fast."
Because knife > machine gun....duh
"it's a mixture between fixed lobbies where one team is basically going to win no matter what and their implementation of eomm/sbmm where your connection/hit reg/etc will be tweaked accordingly. I have over 30 days played, I used to play every day but I agree, it's not fun anymore and takes up way too much space."
"My win loss just plummeted the last few days - hardly won a match and was so hard to keep giving it chances. I was like �I used to like this game it�ll get better� �give it one more game, then give up� and it just never improved. Don�t know what went wrong but I cba to play it in its final state"
As is every Call of Duty
"At least some old games you go back and just have fun playing, this game is not fun at all. I get that these games die but this is ridiculous"
"I legit thought it was just me because people on this subreddit said all the sweats have gone on to cold war so it's pretty fun now I go on modern warfare a month later, nope. Same shit as before."
"The balance has always been shit, but it is tilting more toward shit.  The small maps are basically all one hit shitgun range at this.  The last sniper they added is king of small dick shitter guns.  You can hit anywhere for kill.   Look at the weapons people are using in the killing feed.  It is all the same shit.  Nothing else is worth using.  Bizon is a fucking hitmarker machine.  FAL is actually the worst rifle for long range fighting and middle of the pack for when your nuts are touching.

Other stuff is still brokened.  I was tryna play ystrday and watched some asshole with a knife swing at the air to kill me.  It was old style superlunge perk without the actual lunging.  The network shit is shit.  I get so many deaths where I pop a corner, instant death, and thn get a replay that says the person had all day to shoot me.  I played three days ago, I think, and in the few matches I played, the fewest assists I had with lever action was 8.  The most was 28.  28 assists on 40-something deaths.  I was hitmarking all day.

It was actually so bad to play that I reinstalled the new one to try the shitfest tha is the new zombie game.  Holy fucking boring trash."
"I used to have so much fun just running around using a variety of guns for damascus and having balanced fights. Now you have to use meta weapons but the people I fight either jumpshot, dropshot, camp and mount on walls or just sprint at me with dragon breath shotguns or knives. I couldn�t stand it anymore and finally uninstalled the game"
Were you playing the typical 6x6 and 10x10? I'd say come to Gunfight and FFA.  Gungame is fun too.
Yeah I like to mix it up but usually search for 6v6 TDM/Dom/kill confirmed/hardpoint and then 10v10 TDM/mosh pit all at the same time
"Gun balancing is my biggest complaint.  I just hate how they ""balanced"" guns.  People bitched and moaned about guns being OP so IW nerfs them and now we have a small ass meta that dominates everything.  Attachments are pretty much the same on every gun, longest barrel, red dot, biggest mag, suppressor, and grip.  Shits boring as hell.  

The only time I enjoy this game is when shoot house is in HC and when realism GW is available."
"The game rewards people who play like utter rats and get away with it. People can just peek your team's spawn, spam killstreaks, and you're effectively spawn trapped. Someone can just sit in YOUR SPAWN and farm people who just spawned in for easy kills and then boast about how good they are, but they're just sitting in a corner all the same.

I've lasered someone in HC mid range with an LMG for them to 1 tap me with a mp5 outside of its damage range. Bullshit. I've had bullets go through people and guns practically shooting dust after a good game streak. **shoot first, die first is annoying too, but whatever**

And pussies running around with cheesed out SPRs/Kar98s quickscoping like they're amazing when those weapons have no flinch into ADS when being shot and are overall fucking annoying. (This part is out of frustration)"
what ruined it for me is the val and spr.
"I feel exactly the same...
You literally cannot enjoy playing because you are placed with absolute cretin
And its not even that your bad but everyone just loves to play like a rat
Theres no run and gun anymore and i hate it honestly i just had to stop playing all together because of the camping/ spawn trapping
Worst part is you cant even complain about it or your bad
Its always been a cancerous game but it�s evolved into a different cancer we cannot comprehend"
"Literally bro, I can�t find anything in this game that�s fun. S&D? Sniper warfare and camping. Core 6v6? 725s and MP5s. Livestock 4v4? Jumpshotters who should be in AW. I just uninstalled the game. I�ve had enough"
I can confirm this is fucking horrible now.
"Reevaluate how you�re playing the game. I enjoy the mix of camper elimination and rushing that I can have in higher skill lobbies. Approaching situations more cautiously and taking more calculated risks. Sometimes holding out by playing more passively is what you need to reach your last scorestreak (not camping, but not playing like a dumbass either). Anticipate people in places you know players often are. Don�t hope they aren�t there. 

Take it slow, watch your footstep volume if you�ve got 4+ kills."
"I appreciate the advice man but it�s just not possible, it feels like the game is always against me! I play one way one game, e.g sniping, I have fuckers rushing me with mp5s and dropshotting me. I play like that the next game, I have people holding long angles with snipers and picking me off. I like to run and gun with ARs and SMGs but I just cannot deal with the people that play this game"
"People are always complaining about sbmm, but in my experience I have no sbmm. Either the average player is way better than I thought, or the game thinks I'm way better than I am.

I've basically just relegated myself to stuff like shipment, infected, co op and bot matches.

I like the game, it's just I don't really want to put in weeks just to get good enough so I can slightly enjoy myself."
"If you're enjoying yourself, that's all that matters man."
Everyone that gets destroyed in this sub thinks the game is bad now. They focus on the bad sbmm games they get and not when they�re the top person in the lobby.
"Trust me bro, that�s not me. I have some average games and some games where I�m top. It�s the certain play-styles of people playing the game which is getting to me, and the way I can never seem to get away from it. Like I said, I have over 13 days played on here - I know what it�s like to get shat on. I can�t remember the last time I had a good game on here anymore :("
Lmao get good.
And you felt the need to comment this because?
I dont think so cause there is no prestige. I would like to reset my lifetime KD. I noticed i perform much better especially in Warzone than my overall KD. Would nice to see if i am actually better or if its just a few games.
See before i didn't get the hype for shoot the ship. Now i started to go for gold skins on my favourite guns and I understand why people want it. I'm not gona rant if it's not there tomorrow but it would be nice!
"Very unpopular opinion, but I would love to see the return of Hovec Sawmill 24/7."
Sawmill is a really nice map
Really hoping for Reinforce.
"Same. One of the best gamemodes by far. It's a one life mode that manages to be equal parts casual and competitive. Like you tryhard it but it's much more forgiving than cyber and search. 

I just wish round times were a little longer. Oh and that it showed up more than once every 3 months..."
1v1 gunfight in aniyah palace stims only
LIVESTOCK PLEEEAAASE
"Ikr. I just finished launchers and got plat on them. Now I just need lmg�s, the hdr, dragonuv, model 680, 725, and origin. Then i have Damascus."
"Normal GW will be back I'm sure. 

I personally want reinforce, and maybe a 5 map moshpit. Love those moshpits of certain maps, always fun"
Yes they can. Only way i managed to get some challenges completed where you have to run people over with a vehicle. I am a shitty driver but Wheelson on shipment is just insane.
They can run over Juggernauts too
Please tell me your lying lmAooo I would be very upset if I was a jugg taken down by that thing lol
It is because of your monitor. No matter how good of a computer you have you will always be limited to what your screen can push. In this case 60hz
Beauty thanks. I figured the monitor was the issue but just wanted to confirm.
"This is incorrect. I am at 100-120FPS on a 60Hz 4k monitor.

This would only be the case if you had vsync enabled."
Do you have V-sync on?
Yes it was on. I�ll turn it off later and see if it changes
"It�s your monitor, even if you could have unlocked FPS the screen tear would be horrible"
Can�t complain too much haha. Working from home for the next 6 weeks so it saves me some money for a bit having to buy a monitor right away as well.
"Just remember this OP, you will always be limited by the capabilites of your monitor"
Yea I�m just temporarily using it due to working from home. Saves me some money until I can buy a decent one
"It's V-sync. Turn it off and it will go higher than 60 fps. I have a 1070 with i7 2600 and it goes up to 130 fps at multiplayer. It will not make any difference to you, but it will go higher than 60."
"It's V-sync. It limits your FPS to the monitor's refresh rate, just turn Vsync off and youll be good."
BULLSHIT mode.  period.
Most objective games have stupid scoring that discourages objective play and results in people playing the game as a longer version of deathmatch.  kills by the flagman should get bonus and kills of the flagman should get a bonus.  The rest should be normal.  Most of the games are just some asshole camp in back of a hole.  The team scores points while they do nothing.
"Honestly I like the mode mainly because if you have the flag everyone comes after you and it makes it easy to get kills, other then that it's complete bs because I never understood the point system because it seems like the flag doesn't actually matter ."
how is it easy kills when everyone has wallhacks on the flag carrier? i can barely turn a corner without someone insta killing me because they see everywhere i go
"Terrible gamemode, I just avoid it as much as possible"
kinda hard to avoid it when IW insists on putting it in every playlist they can.
This is just slide cancelling into a dropshot which has been done since IW. You're just cancelling the dropshot.
"i get that, but slide cancelling doesnt drop your hit box instantly like this. This also barely requires any timing just press the buttons in order :)"
what gun is this
"m13, tempest barrel, mono supressor, vertical grip, and g.i reflex :)"
"Just looks like slide canceling to me. But hey if you like it, stick with it. It might help you in game. I personally feel like slide canceling is tedious half the time so I just forget to do it."
Ok I'm down
Okay! DM me with your first name (don�t need to know your last) and your gaming platform and gamer tag with the account number so I can find you.
do yall play other games?
No this is just for Modern Warfare. Other than this I only have a couple single player games.
When was this?
Yesterday
"Wasn't this the message, that announced the ship being infected with zombies and heading for Verdansk? Or is this a new one?

I can't speak Russian so I have no clue what he says but maybe it has something to do with the outbreak event and the nukes in Verdansk."
I had i too last weekend. Also on rebirth but in the small house by the headquater.
Mace is the coolest op buy him
Ordinary mace or a skin for mace and which skin
Velikan is pretty damn cool IMO
Get a operator pack or a tracer unless you play warzone for the BP
how did you reply within seconds of posting this
"Just get a pack for the gun or operator that you like, possibly both in the same pack."
I would suggest the ghost dread wood skin because it�s pretty sick and the azreal one is really overused and I would suggest the nikto take no prisoners skin when it comes back to the shop or you could get the dr karlov lives one
Sgt griggs bundle for ttw hands down best bundle the purple tracer grau mp7 is nice asf to
"Just find your favorite gun, then look at the packs they have for it.
BP is mostly for cold war now so unless you have that game it's not really worth it"
If you use Grinch enough it should show up in the store at some point in refresh.  Make him your showcase operator and just wait.  Had the same problem with the Roze Behind the Mask bundle.  The store shows bundles based on the items you use mostly.
"very cultured facecam, of course"
Rules of filming. The face should be in the center. Hmmmm
"3/4 of a face, anyway."
They don�t instantly surrender?
"Hahaha. When i play Warzone randoms, French people are the ones that you can guarantee will leave if they lose their Gulags... Shoutout to the Germans and Dutch who always seem to have good team work and stick in the game when killed."
Needs to be deeper and more emphasis on the on in hon hon.
Mange tes morts
That facecam tho
What�s your uzi class?
"GI mini reflex, no stock, FSS carbine pro, 41.AE and sleight of hand is my go to on it but in this case i had swapped sleight of hand for the merc foregrip because we had just played cranked."
Great example of the average toxic CoD lobby....
Who the hell puts emphasis on �one� like that when it�s *not* the end?
�M as in �Mancy��
"�In 3...2...1, cut.......now�"
"This is why you specify what the end is before starting the countdown, IE ""On one. Three, two, one!"""
Three. Two. ONE! cut
"Same people who do ""rock, paper, scissors, go""."
"this mission wasn't so good to me, i'm color blind and got desperate that i couldn't even stop to read and see witch is green"
"Have you tried the different color settings for the color blind, to be found in the gfx menu?"
Have you tried not being color blind?
Have you turned color blind mode on in the settings?
Also red/green colorblind here. I played Battlefield 3 and 4 and maaaan those colorblind settings there were so much better than the ones in cod!
What do the green witch�s look like to you most of time? Is it hard to identify based on spell casting ability? J/k
"I'm left-handed so I rebind my keys, the era of stupid action cut-scenes was awful. One of the battlefield campaigns has this part where you follow a slow tank then eventually kill a guy in a bathroom. If you don't hit the button you do the follow bit again and the keys to not die in the bathroom aren't updated from the original control scheme...If you haven't played a battlefield campaign I'll say the only reason to play it is the gun unlock for multiplayer."
Wait isn't there an option to just shoot him once you breach the door?
"That's weird, I have light grey, medium grey and dark grey."
There's also an achievement to get through the entire place with only the 1911
Witches are green? Or are they a shade of yellow? Red green colorblindness is rough
"There should be color blind setting. Playing apex. Legends sometimes it would be really hard to see the red marker after pinging, switched it over to the setting made it so much easier"
"Yeh same I�m colour blind as well and when she said, �cut green� I was like, �wtf is green I don�t see green?!!?�."
and iirc it shouldn't even have mattered.
"Sorry bro, but you comment had so bad, but actually i couldn�t imagine playing some games with a diffrent filter of colores"
"If you're homeless... then like... just buy a house? 

If you're colorblind... then like... just buy glasses? 

Lmao sorry."
Good to see that the campaign has not been forgotten around here
This part was so confusing for some reason
"It comes down to very poor dialogue. 

She first emphasizes to �cut the wire exactly as I say� which most people would assume means cut the next wire she says.

She then doesn�t preface her countdown with what number to cut on. Most people would assume the number one or slightly after one. She also emphasizes the number �one� during her countdown.

Finally, on a 20 second timer, a 3 second countdown is possibly the worst thing imaginable. A much better approach would have been �Green, and cut.�

Essentially, she is the worst bomb tech ever."
Some reason? The video makes it pretty clear its confusing af.
i try 11 times and done.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
Quality reference
Dormammu i've come to bargain
"I did the exact same thing! She is honestly the worst person to have help defuse a bomb.

I need specifics lady!

Edit: I have a video that has similar vibes. 

In a looting section, you�re pressing �square� to pick up items. [Why not continue to press square?](https://youtu.be/w_4CATXfVHc)

Pardon my cackling."
The cackling was one of the best parts for me.
The campaign was lit but hard af
The mission where the mob of people storm the hospital was fucking amazing.
Nvg missions were the best missions I've ever played in a cod game.
"Really? I thought it was one of the easier campaigns to finish on realistic, but that might just be because it�s newer and I have more hours under my belt. 

The only parts I remember having trouble with was getting the assistant out of the embassy and the juggernaut at the end, but neither of those took me more than 30 minutes to an hour. 

Definitely easier than CoD4�s Ferris Wheel extraction on Veteran or getting the Mile High Club achievement."
"And far too short

I loved the campaign but 4-5 hours is a joke"
It was probably the easiest CoD that I've played on Veteran.. the only trouble I had was with that damn juggernaut at the end and maybe the 'Clean House' mission. Everything else seemed easy enough because I did a regular run first before going back through it again.
"I found it much much easier to beat on Veteran than mwr for the simple aspect that there was a finite number of enemies in each section, so staying back for a while to pick people off actually helps. Where as in the mwr campaign the enemies keeps spawning and filling in the same spots of cover untill you can move forwards enough."
"^No ^^no ^^^no, BOIII's campaign was a nightmare on Veteran compared to any other COD campaign...

#*shudders in Frozen Forest and mechs*"
What I�d love is a COD game filled with townhouse style missions
"It was definitely really good but to me, it was the easiest Veteran to get."
"when you were the child was hilarious. It was in those moments that I knew I wanted a child soldier video game in my life, I don't think I'll ever get one, but it would be amazing."
"Yeah I actually died a decent number of times surprisingly, wasn�t really expecting that going in."
I did all missions on realism with at least A on all. Was super fun but hard. Best mission on realism is the nvg one. You really gotta be stealthy
The campaign on realism is so fun. Very very hard but fun. Also I know some people hated the CW campaign but I thought it was phenomenal.
EPIC content my dude!
This was great honestly can�t stop laughing
"This is true, apart from the fact it took me 20 minutes to realise there was the other red wire on his neck"
[Youtube mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBoporOS9KI&ab_channel=CueTheRage)
I died lol. Nice content.
[deleted]
Alex gonna have ptsd in the snd match
"Lmaooooooo this brings back a hilarious memory. Boyfriend and I were playing through the campaign, alternating missions. Of course I was the one who had to do this one. After I fucked it up at least 7 or 8 times in a row, boyfriend snorts and says ""give me the controller, this isn't that hard!""

Boom. And again, and again, and again. We both gave up after a total of at least 30 attempts and got beers. Good times."
[removed]
It's like that movie Edge of Tomorrow
This is really funny!
That happened to me too when I first played mw
How do I know when the count is done irl. Is it at one? Or do I have to wait for you to say 'go'??
Bomb defusal is usually not like this. Just pull the primers out of the c4... right?
Exactly what happened to me lol
"> Exactly when I say not before

BUT YOU NEVER SAID NOT BEFORE"
Most dumb moment in the campaign
"Omg I hated this. For some reason I was playing without sound (there was a reason I think) and everything kept exploding. 

I was so angry before I eventually turned the sound on and even then I still got it wrong a million times.

I know this is kinda my fault but screw that level."
This was by far the worst part of the campaign.
Keep high res pack 1 and 3 2 is the one that's bugged and you wont be able to have all 3 for some reason it's either 1 and 2 or 1 and 3 so just delete pack 2 completely as for the other packs deleting itself no idea. Happens on xbox aswell.
"Yeah, buy a PC."
"Yes. If you have a decent router, enable DoS protection."
It�s a thing lol were you guys talking shit to somebody before y�all got booted?
Actually the people who booted us were spamming extremely racist comments in the chat. Hard Rs and the works. We didn�t say anything back
"Mine said ""installation suspended"" so I deleted and reinstalled the spec ops pack 1 and it has worked ever since"
Congratulations on obsidian
"Thanks, it was a long time coming, though I did get platinum really late into playing this game."
Way to go an congratulations!
"Thank you!  I appreciate the tips you gave throughout the sub.  Ended up looking at your comment history lol.  In the end, did a lot of lobby and mode hopping.  

Played mostly hardcore dom - I think having the notifications of people on flags and how fast it was being captured helped give me info in HC and recognize when I could rush/wait.  If there were multiple people on that flag, I would have waited in the building right in front of the door and just bopped the first one who ran through.  Since there was one as indicated by how slow the meter was going, checked behind me to make sure no one else from enemy team was coming, and I pushed it."
"I use it still these days, makes people rage and call me names. But they have so many chances to kill me, I use it with my sticks and they still can�t get me.

Congrats on completing the camp grind, I did my like last week. I left the launchers for last which was a big mistake because hardly anyone uses counter uavs and personal radars (maybe you in this cid."
"I am not going to lie man, I now have much more respect for those who are actually good with a shield. It took me forever just to get proficient enough with it to get three kills in a row. I had to mute voice chat just because of the toxicity I was getting for using it, so I definitely see the rage. 

And I never used personal radar until I did my launchers. Now I always have it. I didn�t use specialist at all with this grind even though I probably should have, just so I could get some personal radars up for launcher grinders. I didn�t get a 4th kill in this video but if I had, you�d see it�s a CUAV. And the third streak is a VTOL, all for launcher folks. 

Congrats to you too. Now I have to re-learn guns again."
"This happened to me not long ago, I�m not sure what actually fixed it but I closed my game and then held the power button for a couple of seconds then turned my console back on. This seemed to work for me but who knows.

Can you still hear some sounds? I could hear some of the guns shooting sounded so weird."
"Nah I get complete silence unless someone in the party (crossplay party IN GAME) speaks. All the sound comes through my TV otherwise, but even if I change settings around and it mutes those sounds, they don't come through my headset.

Drives me crazy."

Because livestock is literally infinitely better.
"Cold War is ass in comparison to modern warfare it is the new expectation for cod there is gonna be no way that the next modern warfare cod is gonna be as good as 2019 MW they shouldn�t have put the game out of commission,  would still buy the battlepass if it gave me any type of unlocks not unlocks for a separate game such BS"
Meant shoot the ship
Haha I see your point but if you are. Mad because of campers then you need to get better mate...
Only won because Guy 1 sucks ass worse than me
"Current meta seems to be AS VAL, SPR, MP7, etc. If you haven't played in so long that you don't know what the AS VAL or SPR is then I hope you unlock it soon. Because they're fun to use but lobbies are filled with them. Specifically the VAL is extremely OP and has a crazy TTK. They haven't released a major update with weapon balances in a while, so even a month old video or so should be mostly accurate in regards to the VAL and SPR. Sorry I couldn't link to an actual chart or anything."
yea the val wasn't out when I played but I can tell it's good now. I think the amax was the best when i played.

"Have you tried to update all drivers or uninstall and reinstall drivers? I don�t have any of the issues you described, so this isn�t an across the board issue.

What�s your specs?"
"I've updated my driver's and it hasn't changed anything.

I'm on a Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition
AMD Ryzen 2600 6-Core

Ram 16Gb"
"You have a shit gpu, cpu is meh. The fix is upgrade your computer"
I got 400 FPS (According to AMD) prior to the update and at most 40% Usage. Since the outbreak update and new season it's spiked to 70%
"I have just tried to play for a bit and everything is laggy and jumpy, even though ping is around 50. Basically unplayable. I reckon they're still just trying to get people out MW and into CW. Ain't happening. Might just give up and wait for the next COD"
"Check your disc usage. This happened to me on BO4 when my drive was failing, you should try swap what drive MW is installed on and see if it helps"
I have 300 GB free after installation. Gonna uninstall and reinstall and see if there's a change.
"It's at 70% I uninstalled and reinstalled, and then they dropped a new patch and now my issues are occuring again"
"Try setting frame limits. Custom like 100, out of focus 30, menu 30. Enable dynamic resolution and dynamic resolution frame target 100 (like custom one you set). Make MW in Normal Priority post launch. See if that helps"
Now ever since latest patch I get disconnected from party every match
"Every update seems to increasing my loading time. Just searching for games now take forever. Unless I uninstall and reinstall Everytime, it's unplayable"
Oh fuck does the season 2 loading screen look ugly shit. All MW loading screens looked awesome. Season 1 CW looked cringe and this just looks plain stupid.
Ikr its so dumb
this is how it feels to kill the salty admin on his own server

"Manage game and add ons, then go clear reserved space only. Game will have reset. Start up and game will do a small download and your good to go. I have to do this every so often being on Xbox."
No no this is my first it never happened again
Activision has nothing to do with fixing or giving you a way to obtain the skin. That is 100% on either Raven or Infinity Ward to fix it. I would say it�s on Raven to fix since Infinity Ward isn�t updating MW anymore.
Most likely would be raven since they run warzone
Dark blue Charly serves the same purpose and you can buy that one
"Ghost�s UDT skin is a good alternative

Cept yknow he has white to his mask"
"They haven�t even taken out the birds flying around yet, what makes you think a skin is getting dealt with. Plus once people pay for it, you can�t get rid of it. And you obviously didn�t buy/earn it on time. Shits tuff."
there are just as good skins in the store for both teams. for coalition there is a ghost skin from the classic ghost bundle and for allegiance there is a milsim skin from the balkan blue pack. both of those are equally as hard to see as the roze skin
Overpowered or overpriced
"If the season vault packs prove successful if they ever decide to fully release it for everyone, then eventually they might start putting out more down the line.

(Hopefully is the case for Nikolai and Price, really wanted those two)"
"On the contrary, I'd prefer if they made it so the skin had like a bright yellow outline or a glowing aura. The skin looks stupid as shit and already see it way too much"
Dude just raged to losing to one of them I went against a team of 3 roze skins fucking pussies were just hiding in superstore or they hide on rooftops don�t have the balls to have an actual gunfight
"I believe if you unlock (aka buy) a roze skin, youll have challenges to unlock the other skins. But im not 100% sure as i have obtained the skin from the season already."
No it's only available from the season 5 battle pass and that's it
I was using no attachments because I was trying to get gold
"its even faster in plunder, ya can get a level in a single match, but most times 2 or 3"
"What specifically are you doing in those plunder games to level up so quickly? I�m not great at the game, likely below average, so I don�t get loads of kills usually a small handful. What are some objectives I should be going for?"
And this is why I primarily play plunder.
"Thanks for that, I'm gunna give it a try"
"Every game I play, at the end of it  the game will lock up.  Sometimes it unfreezes, other times I have to reboot the game."
I had the same thing with Cold War back when it launched but this is different. It just quits and goes back to the modern warfare title screen.
So after they were being racist you just carried on playing the game as normal...?
And then everyone clapped.

"The amount of white knights jumping at a chance to defend racism in the replies to your post is just disgusting, nice clip bro, fuck those racist shitheads up!

I had a 2v2 match against guys who had [GB88] as their clan tag (Great Britain Heil Hitler) and me and my friend fucked them up,   at the end screen I started singing ""Nazi punks fuck off"" to them ooh boy, they were fuming!

Also, [I called out Trump for his shit quickscoping.](https://youtu.be/7hkROWvYKDA)"
No one is defending racism. The guy talks like hes fighting racism yet continues to spread hate in his replies. Racism isnt the only thing wrong here. Theyre being hypocritical.
Then Obama stood up and clapped. Nice virtue signaling.

Depth of Field?
"Definitely is , turned mine off long time ago fixed that problem."
Use In game settings to adjust that.
I�ve tried
Yeah go to your graphics tab in the game menu and go to the bottom. Turn off depth of field. I believe its in the same spot as motion blur.

"Wrong subreddit bro, go to /r/CODwarzone"
I can tell You one of those annoying ass kids that sits on top of the buildings sniping the whole game. Nice shot tho
Get off that roof you birds
nice camping
He's playing Warzone with a sniper. How is that camping
Permanent Shoot the ship 10v10 should be a thing.
Shoot the ship battle royale
They should just add Shipment & Rust 24/7 modes in Quick Play for Core and HC list.
I WISH they would bring back ESTATE
"Estate, Favela, Terminal, and Highrise must surely be the top candidates for reboots in MW2021.

I'd also love to see Dome from MW3 come back.

And I maintain that Solar from Advanced Warfare would make a great MW map with just one or two ladders or stacks of crates added in. Almost the entire map is already set up with ladders to reach the good jetpack spots."
Shoot the rusty ship would be my preference. When they run any of these playlists I'm all over it.
Dirty old houseboat? I prefer that aswell you aren�t alone lol
"Hell no. I barely find shipment when theres shoot the ship, so no need to throw the tower camping simulator aka rust in there"
"I found Rust was actually the best map for grinding riot shield 3-kill streaks. Even better than Shoot House, and *way* better than Shipment."
Add scrapyard and it�s a 4 way fuck fest. I�m all for it
Honestly fuck the powers that be that ran MW.  It has its issues gameplay wise but they could've done so many map adjustments to make the game better for everyone.  But no it's all about moderating our progression so they'll make more money in microtransactions.  And whoever came up with grind and team defender can maybe move onto hello kitty island adventure or something b/c COD isn't for you.
"They did so many things wrong but just making it fast paced would make the game so much enjoyable, playing cranked is so much fun that's how the game should be, at least it should be like when using dead silence perk"
How about Nuke and Shoot the Ship? That would be epic.
"Livestock is pretty cool. Getting really old having to check SPR/Kar users, though. SPR really needs to be tweaked down."
Take my wholesome award. It�s sad to think the devs won�t update MW itself
i dont know why infinity ward is so dumb
"What gets me is that with OLD CODs they had server browsers and custom servers, so if you really cared you could just set up a Shipment 25/8 server and slam 64 people on that thing if you damn well pleased. 

I hate that they made it ONLY random server matching and no custom servers. That's the only reason COD4 is still alive today- people care enough to run their own shit."
Plus it�s amazing for grinding out gold camos literally so fast
Idk about that I think they should justput out a poll have shipment 24/7 and then a mixture of players favourite maps so shoot house and 3-4 others
My man has 25 hours in his day what a lucky guy
was those pre-nerf snakeshots? Wow that range
"Nah, 2 shots and I bet majority of the pellets hit the guys head."
No it was a few days ago. Keep in mind it�s hardcore

Got lost in the moment haha
What map is this why have i never been here dont flame me i started a month ago

Crude Missile for the Tryhard Sweats lmaoooo :wink:
"Always keep in mind the surroundings when calling in the cruise missile. I know that I sometimes mess up because I hit the top of a building and not the player near the area I was targeting.

I would try and wait for a bunch of enemies to go in a more open area of the map. In general, you can get an idea of where they are either from UAV, Spawns, or when you initially call it in."
"Anyone who�s not running cold blooded should show up as a red box, if they are you should still be able to see them how you would in a thermal sight when you get close."
If you see a box in the map that�s an enemy. If there is an X in the box then they are indoors and you need to ignore them. If you don�t see any enemies and your playing domination or hard point just hit a flag with it
"Dont speed up the missile (i.e. trigger button). Let it go on its own speed first. Itll give you a second or two extra to look at the map/surroundings to try and find a person. Treat it like thermal, you see a dark shadow moving thats a person usually. Otherwise you just see the people with red squares around them. 


If you are really tactical, use the recon drone field upgrade and make them before you launch your cruise missile. You might be able to catch them that way."
"You can fly it in a big circle around the map as soon as you call it in pull back on the stick and bank hard either left or right. It gives you more flying time to see the map, and you can also navigate the missile into some pretty tricky spots where the other team thinks they are safe. You can also pull the right trigger (controller) to fire the missile at a faster speed if you�re trying to hit someone before they make it to cover or something. 

Also, what one of the other users said is correct about the cold blooded perk making the red box not come up. Just have to look for movements on the screen."
You got PS4 ? I play a lot with the Rytec got over 13000 kills

Imagine thinking he�s cheating *insert clown emoji* lmao

Thanks for the YouTube title!
Lol
FYI guys this is not flicking or any of the sort this is toggle stick so sad you all think it�s legit
I'll drop a tactical reinsertion cause I want to know too
default uzi has the best sights imo.
"[I just use a mini reflex](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/m1lqai/livestock_is_what_i_live_for/) because honestly, the only attachment Uzi needs is 41.AE, rest of it can be whatever you want, bro.

My favorite SMG by far."
".41 AE and the pro barrel, for shredding at any distance"
"There's probably about 5 or 6 builds for the Uzi that are all equally strong. It's my most used gun in the game by far, and I tend to change my build every couple days.

Reflex is highly recommended on the Uzi, either the GI Mini Reflex or the Viper Reflex."
I prefer the ironsights on the J Pop-Pop (aka the UWUzi) blueprint. Might just be me though.
None that I've found and it's why I used the aug instead. Slipper clutch ftw
the aug has one of the most obstructive iron sights in the game idk what you're talking about lmfao
"He came back, killed me and tbagged me. Lucky for him my PS4 takes 20 seconds to save a clip."
Dude mine too wtf sometimes longer its horrible why is it so bad
"You can set it to a certain time.   I set mine to longer than a match, then just clip the match at the end if I did something worthy of watching back.    

But then you can be like me and have a bunch of recorded games you don't want to go through all of just to figure out what you wanted clipped then delete."
[deleted]
It�s so satisfying to do that to snipers that wield the riot shield
Miss this game...most of my online buddies just moved on to Cold war and my ps4 space is already full :(
Cold war is legitimately the worst cod I�ve ever played. It feels like a shitty chinese company was contracted to make a cod game.
"I tried the Cold War free multiplayer when they offered it a while ago and god it was terrible, I couldn't believe it! I just couldn't get over how bad the movement felt and decided to just skip it altogether. I'm sure it would be fun if I forced myself to play it... but why? I have MW."
We all still play MW. Ask them to move back.
Fellow famas main.... where is the fallen blueprint my guy?
"I think it's the Jerboa, isnt it?"
"It�s the Jerboa but I changed it to be good for run and gunning, while also having easily controllable recoil."
I always tell myself to use that but never do. Seems fun.
The Famas? It�s very good midrange
Spotter is underrated
Nothing better than seeing players with riot shields die. Salute!
"I always have at least one class with thermite now, shields are everywhere these days for some reason"
Just finished getting it gold and hated it when people called me a coward for using it. Like I�m sorry man I wish I didn�t have to use it!
Was that an Obsidian riot shield? That takes some special kind of commitment.
"It's not that bad. 750 kills. No streaks, no limit on kills per match. Once you get used to it, you can get 20-30 kills per match if you have a good playlist(STS)."
"Had a game the other night where me and this one guy kept hacking his claymore for the last few minutes of the game. Would have been funny if the guy wasn't a camping dog, but what are ya gonna do."
I'm more fascinated by the fact there's someone using the famas
:D
God bro i just WISH i can have people like this in my lobbies again.
Play 10v10 cross play!
An explosive tipped crossbow is also good for teaching very important lessons.
"Don�t understand how people enjoyed this game.

-Safe spaces for campers

-Fast ttk=smaller skill gap

-Doors

-Need to wait on tune up to give you dead silence to rush

-Minimap is garbage

-SBMM

-Mounting

-6v6 is too slow

-CDL playlist was the worst form of ranked ever in any cod game.

-Permanent Ghost


This game was a campers paradise and literally most players were dying for Warzone to be released so they could forsake MW�s multiplayer. I honestly don�t understand why Hardcore and Realism existed in this game."
"I feel like 10v10 fixed all of those issues. Otherwise, you�re completely correct. Too noob friendly. But again, 10v10 is a completely different monster!"

No u
Did the famas get buffed at some point because I'm now using it to get gold and it actually slaps.
Underrated and hard to use in close quarters unless you have quick ADS and the laser.
perfect timing :D
Bruh that�s fantastic. Spotter is a must have perk in warzone too use it all the time. Hacked a trophy system once and the poor guys couldn�t toss his flash grenades done the stairs
HAHAHAH NICE
:D
Nice. I hate shielder. Specially with flash and throwing knife.
I feel offended
I�ve never seen a claymore on that screen before? Wtf was that
He used the Spotter perk to hack the claymore that shield boy put down behind him
Congratulation you have killed one of those bastard riot shield users
"As val pussies are way more annoying, i dont understand why everybody hate rs user"
Riot shielders have a special place in hell

It would take effort to post a clip of this game in any lower resolution. I can find vintage original Modern Warfare compilations that are higher quality.
"it�s pretty average, I think you just got shit wifi"
LOL MF I have 500 down and 300 up WiFi. It�s just shitty PS4. Relax you hillbilly

"When Activision changes your name due to it being offensive they lock you out from changing it for 6 moths, and use one of your own tokens to change your name to user1948294020293. 

Gotta love it eh? They give it new tokens about once a year iirc. They just announced the other day they were giving a new token, right before banning a bunch of people for usernames the next day."
"Oh those fucks. My username was just JuiceWrld but I guess rage reports build up
I appreciate the response homie"
"This might be a dumb question

Everyone gets one.

"I just cant get over how weird the movements are. From the scoping to the sprinting... just unnatural.

I like the zombies, I feel it�s the best zombies it�s been in a while and the outbreak event is cool. But the MP? Damn get a 1.01 KD game and you see [FaZe] Jev on the enemy team next round lmao"
Yep and I'm normaly 1.3. I don't care about zombies I find it to be very boring
ADS time in MW is the time to fully center the reticle. ADS time in CW is **how much time the operator wastes** before **instantly** putting the gun on their shoulder.
[removed]
My kd in mw is 1.64 and my regular kd in cw is a 1.02 and it feels far more sweatier in Cold War for some reason to the point going to dm ultra is a pain. I just get a gun gold and go back to mw for the week
"It's not just that the messed up how cold war feels they also changed modern warfare since cold war was released, it's like the actual resolution or ""focus of your character's eyes"" is less clear than it was, the game visually and felt slightly different before cold war came out."
Yeah I noticed they nerfed the render when cold war guns were integrated.
"If you have an Nvidia GPU did u try to use the custom Sharpening filter using in-game the CTRL+Z command then adding it?

I use Sharpening with 80% Sharpening and 15% film grain and for me it looks better

Every game has it's own filter so it doesn't mess with your other stuff"
Really?
"Uh did you accept the �new recommended settings� during an update or something? Because that can fuck with your settings. I haven�t noticed what you�re talking about personally.

Edit: if you�re talking about warzone I could be totally wrong bc I only play snd"
"Different development team and different engine. 

Treyarch got tasked with taking over a failing project when it wasn�t even their turn. Add on the pandemic which wasn�t helping anything, developing the game for the current and next-gen systems, and lastly they weren�t given any extended time. 

So yeah BOCW sucks and it�s the definition of a rush job."
Should have just dropped it the game os God awful
"I can�t put my finger in it but everything feels significantly less consistent in Cold War. My aim isn�t the best but at least in MW I can consistently tell why I�m losing gunfights, in Cold War it feels like bullets just disappear"
Yes exactly
"Yea I have Cold War played it for 40h but damn...it is subjective but this is wayyyy better for me at least

\- more guns that actually handle different that have actually different scopes, in Cold War I feel almost all of the scopes are the same

\- the gunplay I feel is better, the guns for me feel better when I shoot

\- better engine / graphics - I think this one is objectively so, the game looks beautiful, like a Battlefield game"
Ya I agree with all of the and under shotgun
"Imagine how much better it was before they actively started to dismantle the game due to BOCWs launch.


They couldn't let BOCW stand on its own two feet, they had to knee-cap MW to help it along. Same shit gonna happen to BOCW in 6 months when the next one comes out."
What did they do to MW after Cold War launch?
IIRC it is a different engine. MW is a later build and BOCW is from an earlier fork in the engine
Bad older fork if you ask me
"Felt like a BO4 copy/paste at initial release. When you would unlock stuff in Cold War, BO4 guns would show up, like the Saug. And BO4 attachments would pop up as you leveled your guns up."
Must be the earliest fork because if you told me this game came out directly after bo4 I wouldn't bat an eye.
"It�s the animation. The character models aren�t that bad at all, but the animations remind me of Fallout 3.
Running, meleeing, sliding, it doesn�t feel human. Then there�s the poor visibility. 

If you go to r/blackopscoldwar you�ll find that most of the people who own the game hate the multiplayer too."
"Cold war has its issues but I would gladly take that game over this game and it�s unbearable gunfights and spawns.
I enjoyed mw overall but it is one of the most frustrating cods in recent memory."
This is way better than random spawns and spawn camping bocw just sucks balls
"It's totally different Dev companies, to be fair they were called in at the last minute sort of to finish CW. I understand Activision pulled Sledgehammer off CW. 

Still I love MW 2019 sooooo much better anyway!"
"I understand that, but at the same time... these are triple AAA companies. There isn�t really an excuse to push out a poor product like this"
They should have just dropped it cuz they did a piss poor job
Yeah I believe Charlie Intel leaked that sledgehammer is working on another wwii game for this year
"They clearly picked up from where sledgehammer and Raven left off because it FEELS like a sledgehammer game. Now, this doesn't mean that 3arch would've made something good if they didn't pick up where dumb and dumber left off because TBH, they haven't done anything decent since BO2 and that was like 7 years ago at this point. But this is the root cause of the issue. They probably had to port over what they were working on into this engine or vice versa and the two studios made very different feeling games. 

Plus the animation department on 3arch are just god awful compared to MW. In an interview with the MW animator, he spoke about how his MW2 animations looked terrible. Meanwhile BOCW's animations look worse than MW2's by a country mile. Actually, compare BOCW animations and weapon sounds to BO1's and BO1's outclass them by a mile. How they managed to make them so shit is beyond me."
"Even BO3 looks better than Cold War. Overall it just feels more vibrant and creative. It�s also a lot more fun because there�s no sbmm. Occasionally you�ll run into that one lvl 1000 who�s 15-0 with a VMP in the first two minutes, but I stress the word �occasionally�."
I mean cold war has a mf bo3 engine and it was rushed to shit because of activison
"It�s treyarch bro, what did you expect?  There is a reason all the do is spit out bullshit nuke towns and zombies.  Everything else they do is fucking trash."
Idk it's been years since I really played a cod game thought it would be better.
This sub has fallen into a CW hate sub and its pathetic. I like both but this post is like post #1000 that talks about how inferior Cold War is and how MW is the best game ever made in human history.
And I really do get 2 flying fucks what you think its a shit game
"MW is beautiful except for some FUNDAMENTAL characteristics. Realism, gunplay, graphics, attachments, etc. were incredible. However, ttk, maps, doors, footstep audio were incredibly annoying. Cold War is fundamentally better, but isn't as immersive and enjoyable."
"I personally love the maps, the quick ttk changes it from other games, and I�ve never found footsteps too bad"
Wrong subreddit this doesn�t belong here.
Where to post
"Yep, I'm on pc and the lag over the last couple of weeks has been the worst its ever been. It sometimes goes bad on groundwar, but smaller game modes usually play OK, but it doesn't seem to matter it's virtually unplayable no matter what mode."
10v10 tdm has pretty big maps
"ground war has tons of people sniping, and for good reason. The maps are also big enough to get a longshot even with snipers/marksman"
Shoothouse
CTF
"Hard point, domination, demolition are all good since you can snipe at people running to the objectives, hardcore is also good since you'll never get a hit marker"
10v10 on grazna raid.
"if shoothouse or shipment/shoothouse is in the playlist rotation, it is your best friend for longshots.

Just sit on the table/headglitch on either side on Shoothouse and you can get multiple longshots and headshots.

Its maybe the most boring and imfuriating way, but defintely the easier method.

Otherwise groud war is my other go-to, since it is more sniper/marksman friendly and has a higher player count."
The marksman rifles and dragunov are much more forgiving in hardcore. One shot kill anywhere on the body to any distance
Get good on ground war
Oh yeah..  that's rockin' the game chair off the casters!!
That sure does fit in nicely
I'm kinda shocked it wasn't Promenade
I used to get promenade all the time and I actually don�t mind the map. But now it won�t even come up lol
"Yeah that sucks, but we need more Ground War Maps period. I hope they make some as Ground War is my favorite game mode."
We do. That and more better rotation. But I think we might be on the end of getting new stuff :(
Because always someone quits and leave vacant spot
"That's a very small sample size, I haven't noticed any map being favored over another."
I mean that is backing out of different lobbies and going back in with different players and still getting Aniyah Palace. I guess it�s only a problem for some people that have posted about it before
"Honestly I call bs I love Aniyah and it never really comes up for me, more often I see the airport map (however I still wonder what idiot designed it other thank flanking there is no incentive to go into the airport , like atleast put a flag there like D )"
Nope this was as real as it gets. I decided to do it because an Activision representative told me that it is completely random. I love promenade but never get it anymore. Type in ground war in this sub and you�ll see I�m not the only one
Where's Tavorsk District?
Ahh good catch. Forgot to put it in. Probably because that never comes up for me anymore either
What was your testing method? Did you play all 25 matches or did you leave the lobby after you found one?
This was backing out and going back in but they were different lobbies. It has never been that bad before
"Man I'd kill for 17 matches of Aniyah. My GW experience is usually just Promenade and Riverside on repeat, with the occasional boneyard. 

I don't think backing out is a good way to test it though. Best way to test is play for 50 games and record the map frequency."
See I never get Promenade anymore even though I love the map. I hate Aniyah but constantly get it
i�ve never had a quarry match lmao
Recently or all together?
"Huh, same thing happened with my EMP drone, also on Livestock"

I hate that map in any mode. Mainly because you almost always spawn 1000 yards from everyone else or right in front of an enemy. Total waste of time. If I wanted to run all over the place alone I would play mirrors edge.
"You die and spawn and it's just like, fuck, do I really want to run all the way across the map again to engage, then someone shoots you from behind."
Theyre conditioning you to buy Battlefield when it comes out.
can we just remove it altogether? the flag placement is utter shit.
"Jesus, this map on hardpoint is fucking pointless to play. I haven't had it come up in a long time though, so did they maybe remove it as a hardpoint map?"
Ran 2 laps of it yesterday before I found a fight.
Swap it for shipment. The april fools 10v10 was honestly the most hilariously chaotic thing ive ever played.
"*cries in spawn kills*

For real though, that mode was such chaos and excitement all packed into a tiny map. I miss shipment and shoot house :("
"Fun aside, that April Fools joke was funny as hell...to a degree. Then they made it stays for like two fucken weeks straight. People who play Core love it for obvious reason, but 10v10 HC Shipment was a total ass-crap. It was literally unplayable with Shipment pre-patch spawn and 20 guys. The game didn't know the how and where to spawn people at, there was no spawn-protection, bullets flying everywhere, the shit was fucken nuts. I remember dying 25 times in a row just because the moment I spawned I was shot death by 10 other people (not including my fucking teammates) and couldn't even moved an inch away from spawn. That joke was fun, but it was total AIDS."
"Remove Aniyah palace in all forms from the game 


Pretry sure this is what you meant."
"I actually kinda like that map. Had one of the absolute best rounds of my life on there recently. Nowhere near a favorite map or anything, but I like having a big map from time to time."
"Same, i like it in Death Match and Dominaton. Thou in Ground War it is not the best."
The game**
"I actually really enjoy Aniyah for 10v10 Hardpoint and Ground War. Hate it for everything else though. Too large for TDM and KC, and Dom just leads to spawn trapping and easy triple caps."
It was actually removed from Dom over a year ago when they added it to GW.
"I'm surprised how many people hate Incursion, it's actually one of my preferred maps (not the best, but better than most IMO). You'll get no argument from me on Palace though, shit is comically oversized for anything other than Ground War"
"If the spawns would flip more aggressively, it would be fine. But, like most maps in this game, spawns do not flip when needed."
"I love incursion hardpoint. You get 3 hardpoints in a row in the palace. It's chaos and a lot of fun 

Unfortunately they removed it from almost all playlists a while back. It's only in Hardcore now, not in core at all :("
get rid of arklov peak too
"In 6v6 Respawn modes i agree. 

10 V 10 is fine."
"The only game mode Aniyah Palace actually works on is ground war. 

And it's arguably the worst ground war map."
wasn't it designed for a cut 20v20 mode?
The worst mode for this map is Cranked.
I feel like Headquarters is the worst mode for Aniyah Palace.
"Agreed OP!! I absolutely fucking LOATHE Aniyah Palace for ANY of the game modes. It�s a fucking intricate ass map with so many cool places, but it�s just way too goddamn large. Why am I running for 45 seconds straight and still not seeing anyone??  Have any of you played Headquarters on Aniyah Palace?? The HQ spawns on the opposite side of the fucking map and whichever team is closest to the HQ has the advantage without even trying. FUCK that map.

It would be fucking amazing if it was scaled back in size and just confined to the palace grounds, and not the entire city surrounding the palace."
Aniyah palace demonstrated that IW doesn't know how to make MP maps anymore.
"The only fun I ever had on this map was in the very early days they had a weekend of some kind of prototype of Ground War Infected where it was 48-player Infected on that map. Not only was it balls-out crazy, the XP rewards were insane."
"When the map first showed in MW, we played 6v6 on it and you complain about 10v10."
It sucked then and it still sucks now. Don�t gatekeep complaining you moron.
"No we didn't. It was tested with 20v20. We saw some early gameplay from that map. It was released as 10v10 map, but after some time it was added to 32v32 as well. Never 6v6."
Just back out. It�s so much better.
"I really like it. Every COD needs a big, slower paced map. I really don't think it's that slow in 10v10 either, especially as most people ignore the village areas

It's really good in GW"
Nope it�s a great map
"Not for 10v10, I like aniyah incursion in 10v10 and it�s okay in 6v6, but aniyah palace doesn�t play good in even ground war"
Why can�t cod developers make good maps anymore? Almost forgot how bad mw was map wise
"I tink most of the OG devs that worked on CoD4 and MW2 went and formed Respawn Entertainment after the whole fiasco after MW2 between IW and Activision. 

I know the artist on Titanfall 2 came back for MW2019 though."
"Remove it from TDM and KC sure, but I honestly love HQ on aniyah"
"You're fucking insane, man."
I too love running from the other side of the map to the other side the whole game /s
"It�s definitely my favorite off meta weapon, it�s really good with the 5.45 rounds too"
"Man, this weapon gave me so many good clips. Very fun to use."
Nice work.
Thanks!
The AK was my baby.
It's a very nice weapon
"can we get the loadout? (class, perks)"
"Sure.

1st clip:

- compensator
- no stock
- stippled grip tape
- 5.45, 30 rd mag
- commando foregrip

Perks:
- EOD
- restock

It's your activision/call of duty account password.
I linked and used my Playstation account as my Activision account so it should basically be the same. But I don�t know why it�s not working.
Same fucking issue here and im ready to just give the fuck up. Changed my password.. tried diff authenticators.. it doesn't matter. Same issue.  Invalid password and or code.. somebody HELP please!
Raven messed up all if the attachments
I noticed that yesterday too
"I did not spend much time on it, but found same thing when I swapped fmj for suppressor on lever action gun.  I was getting many more hitmarkers that I felt should have been kills.  I was not sure if it was the suppressor or invisible geometry hurting damage range.  I felt like it was always a problem even when some invisible edge could not be a factor."
[deleted]
What about this says it�s for Warzone? I was playing multiplayer.
Lol I prefer if you would keep your snotty comments to yourself. A portion of the members here are anti dick head
"Technically they are working how they should do. To get the quiet sound you hear when using one you would usually use different ammunition.

With normal ammo it wouldn't reduce the sound that much and not to the point off the ""doof doof"" sound you hear.

Maybe they are compensating the velocity to save them having to put different ammo in the gun."
"You use heavier ammo to go sub-sonic. Since kinetic energy is a function of BOTH velocity and mass, upping the mass sufficiently will still maintain or even increase kinetic energy."
*Bonk*
"Not horny, I just find it cool and attractive!"
"Blue boobs. As for a serious answer, I have no idea."
"I found it, it's called I'm Up Here."
"Down bad, bro"
Ahh yeah that�s called the fresh air challenge....go get some
"I get fresh air daily when I go cycling and work, what do you mean :D not everyone is a basement dwelling gamer. 

And yes I like boobs."
">Hey yeah, I can relate... I simply think it looks nice, attractive as in nice picture for the eyes cus you see it regularly, and cool and awesome to equip. Not everyone who likes those cards is a raging wankstain :D"
How do you get one?  reward from ????
I think it came with season 5 and we can't get it anymore.

[removed]
"I'm praying for another year of mw support... I'm not too thrilled at the thought of cod 2021 being a ww2 game. I just have no interest. Now that i've almost finished dark matter for black ops cold war, i've started putting in major work on my secondary mw tag."
"I feel the same, ill just keep playing this and Warzone and also play Battlefield 6 (supposed to be modern again)."
"Why the fuck are they going BACK to WWII( if it�s true) lmao come the fuck on.

WWII is a interesting part of history, but man, don�t nobody want that shit."
"I hope we get more content too for MW2019, but I�m doubtful at this point we�ll get anything.

I just hope with cod 2021 Sledgehammer Games has learned their lesson or if not it�ll be another shit show.

My only hope if sledgehammer is really doing another WW2 game, is that they learned from their mistakes with their previous WW2 game.

I loved the weapon selection and operator outfits as well as camos. But they need to take that from a 7 to a 11. Like PLS don�t try to be a gritty realistic ww2 game they proved that failed with the launch.

I still remember playing WW2 on launch and how awful the movement and class design was."
"I haven't touched cod MP since CW release outside of 4 hours to unlock the Groza for zombies. I'm hoping MW get's updated, would love to see some new content in a good COD rather than just CW adds being injected into it constantly."
"I was optimistic, but there's still no word about it, so I'm starting to feel like it might have been delayed to April with the new warzone map."
\^\^\^
It should come out sometime this season considering it�s a warzone ground loot gun and they rotate ground loot each season..
They removed it from ground loot
It's a rumor still but I'm optimistic they will release the guns at some point during the year
"The leaker came from Gamerant I think from a ""Source"" that we'll have new content on that day BUT I think this the same day scheduled for the Nuking of Verdansk too."
Whats the rumour?
"An apparent ""Season 7"" for MW which'll add the Scorpion Evo, Makarov, and RAAL LMG, plus 2 6v6 (or 10v10) maps, and 2 gunfight maps"
"Do i believe there will be a nuke in Verdansk? Yes! Do i think it will happen tomorrow on March 11? No!

Doesn't make sense for them to do something so drastic in the middle of a season.  

I think the new weapons will probably be dropped with a new season."
Isn't that train station?
The gunfight map
How?
"It�s on Station not trench. First of all create a class with as much ammo as possible, I suggest overkill lmgs. And there should be, on the station side, 6 stone shapes on the walls. Shoot the symbols (it takes a short while) then enter the numbers left to right on the keypad under one of said shapes. Quickly look behind you and watch teddy Godzilla in action. :)"
This is definitely trench
My bad lol I said the wrong map name.
Try setting priority to Normal (it launches in High by default) also try ISLC intelligent standby list cleaner too. It helps for some including me.
"I feel this, honestly what has killed me from the franchise, they just don't seem to care as much as they do anymore, the game feels amazing at its best but I don't get to play it often when its in its ""best"" just today I tried playing again after like 1.5 months of not doing so and I just keep getting 345 blazing gator error.. im ready to uninstall and forget about the game tbh XD"
"What is weird is I keep reading comments like this and yet, in the year that I've been playing this game, I've had almost no issues at all. One or two random crashes to desktop aside It's all good.

 I did what someone here suggested, turned the games priority in task manager to normal and I run msi afterburner in the background for better temp control and that's it, havent touched it since. This game is either really inconsistent across different systems or it's got something to do with your system in particular."
Do you have an RTX series graphics card?
Play campaign online not offline
How do you know if you are playing online?
Don't we all connect to the server first when we start the game?
"I would love to join and play with you at some time when you are free. I don't have MW installed on my PS4 and only play on PC if that's okay.

Also, I am busy with some of my uni work right now, but I'm free at night to play.

Edit: Typos"
"Idk how much i can play at night but usually late night i can play, pc is fine, only rzn ps4 is prefered is gamechat vs ps4 party chat, u can dm me ur cod name and the number tag whenever"
Hey I also need that challenge. I'm on pc in EU.
Well im on rn if you'd like to play
I'd love to help soon but if also need help with a challenge to get a shield skin. I need 2-3 people in my party and in also on pc
Yes same one! I can play whenever
"Yo is it the shield blueprint, I'd help, i don't have a mic tho :( , can I join the lobby tho, I really want that mission to be done too, I'm free from 5-12 PST. :) 

Playstation name is ""Aladdin\_Army"""
What all needs done for the shield One?  I saw it but never bothered to actually go they and read any thing for it
Yes it is and no mic is ok! Ill add u
I'm always down as long as it's not s&d
"Oh yea it'll be tdm or something like that, i need 3 ppl to play with now unfortunately as im on the 4th objective for the shield"
"""Fifty thousand people used to live here. Now it's a ghost town"""
What the fuck is even that?
"This occurs is becuz of high ping and it becames like this, if it is low ping then it wouldnt be like this"
ah wonderful connection I see
"Ah, so you can stop time now."
If you look carefully you can see the Lizard people in the background very stealth.  ;-O
I don�t really understand the NAT type. I strictly run Ethernet cable and 80% of the time it�s open and the other 20% it changes to moderate.. not sure why this happens but I don�t notice a difference in game ever
Lmao
The absolute bullshit in this game
"There's no fix unfortunately, It only works on Cold War. 

Which sucks, because I would play MW19 way more over Cold War if you can use legacy prestige icons in game. Even though Cold War isn't that bad of a game, it's not my favorite CoD game to play."
Thx man! Can CW players see my real prestige icon even if Im on MW or will be the same?
"Bale: Security Detail bundle.

You know, if we get it."
"That sparks bundle is really tempting, man"
I�m having this problem aswell but I either want to wait for soap or buy the Balkan Blue Lightning Unit bundle
Mara forest ops is in your store?
"Sadly, not yet"
"if you have cod points in cold war,  can they transfer on modern warfare/warzone?"
"I believe they do, yes"
16-bit tracer pack
"Finally, a fellow hard earned money chad  


These broke ass virgins downvoting hoping they get something for it, I swear"
just don't. waste of money.
I mean you can�t really withdraw CP to real money so may as well use them in game
"I mean, it's my money. I get that it's just a virtual item that isn't tangible, but so what? You do you, I'll do me, bud. Cheers"
Play Modern Warfare (but MW not Warzone)
"Can�t even get to MW anymore. Keeps taking me to the �purchase Cold War, Warzone and MW Campaign screen every time I load up"
"You can't see black ops content in mw (except for the battle pass, but that's a screen you can just ignore.). What do you mean?"
I like it when these type of trickshot videos end with the player stopping for a second to think about what happened.
I miss this map. Every time I play nowadays all I get is Broadcast and Oil Rig. Over and over and over again.
It seems that around late December they put it into the rotation for Search and Destroy. Sometimes I also will get it while playing 10v10 mosh pit.
The Ax-50 is a gun I wish I was good at. The rechamber sound is so nice
"Facts. I love most of the sounds in modern warfare. Guns, character movement, equipment, you name it."
"Just practice a bit! I got used to it on... Oh, whatever that mode is where you play TDM on the Battle Royale map. Good long distances, plenty of bushes to hide in, and you get a real good feel for the bullet drop with different length barrels. It's a treat."
Get ready for the cheat accusations
LOL I know got accusations after the round ended
I�d accuse you too if you handed me my ass on a plate like that. Good shit!
That jumping no scope was fucking tasty.
That 2nd no scope was insane fam! What�s the secret cuz my no scopes never go straight and you�re over there playing halo?
just try put your crosshair on them
"could you post your loadout? (class, perks, equipment)"
"Sorry for a late reply, I always use tracker as my perk, double time, ghost.  For equipment always have throwing knife in case I miss a shot haha, ax50 just a regular snd meta"
i would hate to have you in my game
"This was crazy, good stuff"
LMFAO better hope modern warfare doesn't send u to the shadow banned realm
Do this in hardcore then ill believe ur skills
"Hardcore doesn�t mean shit, he didn�t get hit once lmao"
yeah because 1 shot kill SMGS are completely fair
"Bruh these are quick scopes not no scopes, no scope implies you don�t even touch the ads button."

"D�j� vu, never been in that place before."
Double xp tokens don�t work for trials. It�s not a bug you only get double xp from trials when a double xp event is activated and that�s how it�s been for awhile
"Since the start of MW 2XP simply doesn't work for me. And yes, for trials specifically they do this filthy trick. 

For context, I contacted Activision and they told me to just �clear the cache,� which as you know didn't work."
did you just get the game?
Yes
To give some constructive criticism and not because I wanna shit on you because everyone already pointed out that you probably should�ve cropped away a good 10 seconds from the beginning but to me it looks like you�re playing on a way too high of a sensitivity for your skill. Unless you�re intentionally increasing it 1 by 1 to improve and get used to it but it�s clear that your movement is choppy cause you don�t have enough control. I�d knock my sens down a peg or 2 if I were you!
It says season 3 so Id assume it was in the BP
"I just checked, it wasn't"
I would try a scan and repair from Battle.net launcher. Careful though. I did it and it got stuck in a loop. I had to do a full uninstall / reinstall. But it works great now. Good luck!
"Stupidly enough I haven�t tried that yet, I�ll take a look, thanks!"
Have you tried reinstalling shaders?
What do u mean by that?
sadly i dont have a PC but maybe you could try reinstalling.

How in the dick nuts is Baker ?
Why in the dick nuts is Baker?
Gimp vs pimp
I want Mocap in MW.
"I smell some bullshit coming to MW multiplayer soon. Last week a dataminer leaked Samantha Maxis' voicelines on youtube and she had lines for MW killstreaks like the Vtol, the Wheelson and even the tactical nuke. I just hope that Activision is not crazy enough to think about butchering MW by merging operators from
MW and BOCW together for the multiplayer"
That would legit just mean I never play cold war again lol. At that point whats even the point of playing it lol
"Those are voice lines for warzone. Specifically for potential content. Personally I wouldnt mind cw ops in mw multi, as they somehow have more life here than in cw multi."
"If you set your operator to random isn't that what you get, letting you know it could be any character."
Baker is an Cold War operator- so it shouldn't be in MW
"Don�t shoot the guy doing gymnastics, he�s harmless"
Turret* I have a friend that says turrent and its just not a word.

The end where the video abrubptly stops after you finish reloading?
Wait what me confused?
"No I meant the no scope,
 I dont really hit those"
No it wouldn't.
Yes it would
"It's not amazing because of the fire rate, certainly does some damage from within 5m but so do all the shotties. I've found the best to be the jak and the origin from MW. The street sweeper is OP if you've unlocked it, just takes a year to reload."
BearPig has a class setup for rebirth for the VLK Rogue that up close makes it a 1-2 shot kill. Pretty interesting I would suggest it
im guessing you have thx set to competative mode turn that off in synapse i had same issue with apex legends settle for surround mode not competative or enviromental
i tried with THX off. The problem is the voice chat and output devices.
"Aim assist really isn�t that strong, it gives a slight advantage, but not all that much"
"Yeah, but this mission is 30% skill 70% luck. Specially when you're alone. Aim assist gives you some seconds advantage, that can make the difference."
It�s mostly just luck i feel i tried this and thought i got a good time but i was still around a minute off 3 stars. If youre going for the final reprieve shotgun blueprint it�s in a bundle if you don�t wanna go through the hassle of getting it.
"It isn't about the blueprint, It's more about completion. But now i see that it is completely pointless to further waste my time in something i can't reach.

Activision did a real mess with this mode. You are alone against at least 100 terrorists, that have grenades, mortars, suicide bombers and apparently the ability to teleport. They also always know were you are, and the IA is really bad, making them walk in a straight line to you. The only thing that makes the deadly is their massive numbers, high damage, and bugs. This would be easy, if i didn't have the pressure to get the mission done in less than 10 mins. They should just put a different difficulty for each star. The only way i have to get the 3rd star, is with a duo, but i don't want to waste the time of others in this."
Check the audio settings in game you can control the volume of music explosions etc there
Huh where i dont get it
I normally turn my volume up 2 ticks on the boom box hope this helps
"They honestly should have had an option to enable it in private games since MW came out.

but yeah an entire playlist for third-person mode would be awesome"
"They should just make it a toggle in the options menu, like that Star Wars shooter.

The only complaint anyone has ever had about 3rd person giving an advantage over 1st person is that you could use it to corner-peek in MW2, but that can be prevented with camera-handling code. 

There's really no reason why 1st person and 3rd person can't exist in the same ecosystem � making it a toggle in the options would allow us to play 3rd person in every game mode we already enjoy."
"Except pve, I can see this being really annoying in PVP. People just staring at walls waiting for the other to peek. One of the reasons Destiny 2 pvp is a crap experience is because people [abuse the 3rd-person camera peeking with Swords/emotes.](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23/status/1355288418863828993)"
"That's the problem with every 3rd person game, all you can do is adapt or don't play it"
"That�s a great point, but as someone who plays D2 a lot it�s only prevalent in the competitive playlists, which are already completely broken shitshows even without 3 peeking.

I believe MW3 had a playlist that was 3rd person, and 3 peeking wasn�t much an issue"
You dont even need to look at other series just look what 3rd person emotes done to Bo4
That's part of the fun.
"I can get behind this. All other shooters offer the 3rd person options, especially with battle royal styles.

I bet they'd pull in a whole lot of other players from PUBG and Fortnite if this happens"
You look like a man who has experienced many a shower with any another man
It's for BOCW/Warzone
"That�s from the Cold War battle pass, you can use it it Warzone or Cold War, but not in Modern Warfare.

Edit: since the integration of the two games you can see all the blueprints you own in the Modern Warfare armory."
"The weird barrel assembly attachment, drum mag, and chopped off front sight tell me this is definitely the Cold War MP5."
It's this season's Rank 50 reward
It's the seasonal reward for cw/wz
That's the MP5 from Cold War. r/blackopscoldwar will probably have the answer
It's some BOCW trash
I change cpu priority to medium to low to keep stuttering to min
In task manager you mean?
Gonna sound dumb but have you tried it with Vsync enabled/disabled?
I have it disable. My monitor is Gsync compatible. But will give it a try. Ty.
Are you using a usb bluetooth dongle and wireless bluetooth controller?
I am using a mouse and headphones which both have their own dongle for wireless connection. But that's not bluetooth protocol is a proprietary one (bluetooth doesn't have the bandwidth for simultaneous HQ audio in and out for example)
"The game can randomly stutter without any fps drops or logical reasons, and it does this often. For me it stutters like half the time I boot up the game, and you can instantly tell if the problem is there in a couple mins of playing.

For the fix go to nvidia control panel, global 3d settings, and turn off the Shader cache. Then apply and restart your pc for it to take effect (at least I read you need to do it, so I've always rebooted and it has worked). Then go back to NVCP and enable the Shader cache and restart your system again. Now the game should work flawlessly.

Another thing which has helped ppl to fix stuttering (including me, in the past) is going to file explorer and follow this path: (C:\Users\your user name\Documents\Call of Duty Modern Warfare), and inside the MW folder there is another folder called ""Players"". Just delete the Players folder, it won't reset your ingame settings or anything and it will be rebuilt once you boot up MW.

Doing both of the steps I mentioned always fixes it for me, but I haven't figured out what causes the problem. This problem started happening with some of the big updates MW had around CW's release.

Also my system specs (so you know it's not my hw causing the problems):

Strix 2080ti OC

10900k

16bg 3200mhz cl14 ram

970Evo Plus SSD

1080p 240hz monitor with G-sync module
(Btw I'm playing mw with G-sync and V-Sync enabled, @200hz so fps also caps at 200, for the maximum frametime/fps consistency, which makes the picture so smooth even the smallest stutter is visible)

Edit: The game also occasionally stutters because of server/network issues, and it also shows the orange Packet loss icon on the left side of your screen when it happens. Those you can't do anything about afaik, but they're so rare it doesn't bother me"
Thanks man. I'll give it a try tomorrow and will comment about the results.
" Well, I tried what you told me and nothing. The games just stutters no matter what I do. I'll try setting all graphics down and see if that does anything. But it definitely seems like a server side issue."
I set all settings to low and the stuttering continues. But only when the package burst appears. It is just something related with the servers or to my ISP.
"I believe I have corrected it and minimized this problem.  Adjust your virtual memory to custom size. Each gig of ram is 1024mb. So if you have 16GB of ram set your custom paging initial size to 16384 and maximum size to 1.5x that number (24575)   Set it and restart.  (If you don�t know how to do this YouTube �windows 10 how to adjust virtual memory� .  ThenMake sure you go into the Adv_options and set video memory scale to 1. And then renderworkercount to the amount of physical cores. 6 for me and for the 3600x.   This fixed my problem!!! I also did a slight over lock on my ram from 1.35v to 1.39v.  Not sure if that helped or not lol

I think it�s due to memory leaks and this should help it!"
That's server side I believe
Yeah that's what I found out. But when playing with a friend in the same city he was having no problems. I guess it cab be ISP related but other games just work without problems in this context.
You have to zoom in otherwise it looks to far I�ll download the actual clip if you must
care to elaborate OP? What happened
I always attempt to beam through that door at the start of every game on this map. It usually works for a couple of rounds before people learn their lesson on like 20% of games there.
You just have a good gaming chair
"How can someone be skeptical about this? I thought people are used to being beamed thru the walls already? Like I wall-beam dudes crossmap all the times in ShootHouse. It's a pretty easy guess, blindly shoot at the contarner and kill people. And then there was the AS-Val."
We need more than a 12 second clip filmed with a phone from a screen at 10fps.
I got third parted straight after it my friend got instead this is all I had looked really sus in full time
Why would you think that he is hacking?
Well  I thought it was game lag but after my friend thought it was sus maybe it was it was just the fact he was looking away and the turned on to me perfectly hit the first bullet of corse it could of been luck I just wanted to see what others thought
You missed your Kar shot.
Ye I know it�s not my kar98 had some wired attachments on it
"I mean it�s kind of possible but reasons for that are simply he snapped and shot you pretty quick. If he saw you on UAV, out of the corner of his eye while using 120 FoV, or had suspicion that you were over there then he�d be legit. Also he didn�t kill you, he just made a body shot from the looks of it and most hackers don�t use that setting they prefer headshot locking not body shot."
Battle hardened protects against flash and stun not lethal. EOD protects against lethal. If you trip a mine hit prone and you'll take minimal damage.
No.
At least landmines work in MW.  In Warzone I have to double mine just to knock someone down.
"I would get the Roze Behind The Mask bundle. 

2 reasons: Acid Tracers, and availability. 

There�s a possibility it may get bugged again in the future in which case you may regret not picking it up while you had the chance. The other 2 packs were never affected by the store visibility bug. 

In regards to the Amethyst pack keep in mind the butterfly knife is just a reskin of the regular knife with a unique inspect animation. It isn�t its own weapon class as it was implied on the roadmap. 

I own all 3 btw. They�re all good bundles for both the weapons and operator skins. :)"
Grigs bundle comes with M4 and MP5 with dismemberment effect iirc
"Mil sim bundles are fire Russian FSB, Frogman, 
Balkan lightning black skin: hide in the shadows like roze rook skin; So is explosive ordinance and the desert marauder mace bundle. The singularity domino skin is damn sexy and i like all the roze skins, shes my favorite female operator."
"I have the season 5 Roze skin so I can always use that if I ever need to be stealthy, That Domino skin is so amazing tho but sadly it hasn't been in my store since it came out (Also isn't in the armory) So I can't get that.  


Ty for the suggestions!"
I have the acid roze pack and the amethyst pack and regret not buying the original roze bundle
Are they bad? Or would you do you just like the Roze bundle more?
"In the future if you're on pc buy the starter pack on bnet that comes with ghost plus gun blueprints in addition to 2400cp.  

If youre buying effect based skin you should buy based on whichever weapon you use the most.  If youre a MP mostly it's best to get dismemberment rather than just tracers b/c the blood splat is rather satisfying up close."
"Yeah I did in fact buy the Ghost pro pack, There should also be a new one with Stitch today I think.

Yeah my favorite weapons are the Amax and the MP7 and I already have purple tracers for the MP7 so I'm leaning for the Roze bundle for the sweet blue tracer & dismemberment Amax."
"I like the acid effects and the Beretta is my favorite sidearm, but you'd probably be better off with your first choice. I just don't think the M13 is as good as the AMAX. M13 is fun to fuck around with, but you'll probably want to main the thing you get in your pack and if you're not a fan of M13, you'll probably just not enjoy your purchase."
none of them.
The grim reaper bundle
[deleted]
"yeah the amax is my favorite MP AR so that's why I said I'm leaning towards the Roze Operator Bundle.  


Ty for the suggestion!"
dont get any bundles
"I would get that Alex deathstalker bundle if i had 2400cp, but if you want roze go ahead and get her"
"I actually really like that one but I�m mainly looking for allegiance operators as well as guns that have tracers or dismemberment (or both)

Tysm for the suggestion anyways!"
Wait two days to see if the leaks are true.
what leaks?
2/2 Ive contacted activision support about a week ago and i�ve seen that people haven�t gotten replies from ATVIsupport in months and still have yet to get one. is there anyone that can help? im desperate since ive easily dumped more than $300 into this game.
Follow up: im on the verge of giving up.. does anyone know how i can find this persons email and reset accounts or literally anything.. im so desperate for any help
Frangible disabling?
"if that is Frangible disabling, it's is OP as Fu right now...just like any other random thing on COD after some stacked updates..."
Probably not. Most likely someone dropped stun grenate under OP and then just shoots him with regular flitching
As the other guy said it�s Frangible disabling.
This is why I always put frang disable on my shotguns in wz back in the old days of O12 meta.  As a specialist player in mw these little things are things you learn playing that mode.  Most people wouldn't care about it since it's so niche.
"Disabling doesn't do anything against armour. It's still worth it on the origin tbf as sometimes youll get 2 or 3 hits on unarmoured guys outside the best range, but just thought I'd mention in case you didn't know"
Frangible disabling dude. People rarely use it but its great.
perk called frangible - disabling
probably has that stupid frangible disabling perk
I think I have the same issue ..
How is your CPU when this is happening?  I had similar but fixed with process lassoo.
Temp wise or load wise?    Id have to check.  Neither game has ever stressed my cpu before though.
"Be patient and learn the map and enemy movement patterns, highly recommend using the M13 and fighting more people at 30-60 meters. Use the commando grip, marksman barrel, 60 rd mag, vlk scope, mono suppressor. I was not very good at it when I started either  (like I struggled to breakeven with KD) , now I often go 40-90 kill games with a 1.5 minimum KD. BTW theres little to no SB-m,m in ground war (can't say on the reddit) so the enemies may be above your skill level"
"Yes, I die more on ground war too. You have to change your play style though. And to be honest the fact your bringing up the K/D for an objective based 64 player map means you're in the wrong mindset, captures and defends win games, not kills. If you want kills on ground war snipe, but your team will lose if you're not objective focused too. I have 2 load outs for ground war, one sniper and one for pushing objectives, I switch between them several times during a game."
I get more kills with a long range AR than sniping in ground war.
Nobody cares about winning you gain nothing from it.
"Like other people have said, you just have to change your mindset. Try to imagine it almost like a real battle, you think people run around like maniacs in real life combat ?? No, why ? Because you can die from literally any nook and cranny. Take it slow, watch corners, don�t run everywhere. Think about what positions the enemy might be: windows, walls, behind vehicles, etc."
"Try loading up with an Oden or slower firing assault rifle.  Throw a heavy silencer on it.. basically make it the least mobile gun ever.

Then, go slow.  The Oden with this load out will force you to slow down a bit since you won't be able to just sprint around and ADS super quick like you can in most multiplayer modes.

This slowness will help you learn to look around before moving out into the open, increase your map awareness, and all that jazz.

Took me a long time to learn to simply slow the fuck down.

It's worth it.  I'm often 4-5 KDR per game unless we get unbalanced teams and get slapped.. even then I make it out with at least 1."
"You're un-ironically telling him to go with a oden to ground war? Man, belceb� must have a special place for you in hell"
"Yes, you will die more in Ground War.  If you don't like dying, play as an anti-sniper.  For me, it's all about the map.  My worse map is Annoying Palace.  I still haven't figured out how to get around that map without dying."
Annoying Palace. Lol. One of my least favorite maps along with Grazna Raid. I am complete shit at ground war. It's so full of snipers that I honestly don't think it's very fun.
Same bro just gotta be slower idk I'm asking myself the same question
"I can share with you some advices. Eventhough right now my KD has gone to hell (I'm grinding for the Damascus and with launchers, shield and knife you die alot ALOT!). Ok, here I go:

1. You gotta know the map well, I mean: REALLY WELL, know your flanking points, covers and safe covers also (places where you can point and shoot without being a sitting duck for some sniper
2. Try to use a combo of sniper and a good  AR with nice medium range both with silencer
3. Always check the map when spawning to see how the battle is going, move with your team, don't be a RAMBO unless the other team is playing really bad and not covering each other
4. Stay focus on the area you want to take advantage of, or well,the area where the flag is: are there enemies?, is the area clean?, if not clean: begin cleansing one enemy at a time
5. Always check your mates position, that is of the most importance for having situational awareness
6. Always pay atention to sounds, specially the automatic call outs made by your team mates, they always alert you when engaging an enemy
7. Dont rush anything unless you know exactly where the enemy is (for example, you see a flag is filled with your teammates and no enemy is close)
8. Only make mini rushes when moving to one cover to another, but if there is a corner and you haven't explored well or spot enemies and there is close shooting towards your position, is almost for sure you will get killed and have that nasty feeling of ""I spawn I die every time"". That is a TACTICAL MISTAKE and CAN and SHOULD BE AVOIDED unless you love to be frustrated all the time

I can tell you more but it will be too long. I wish this helps you a little bit! Good Luck!"

The Conduit blueprint for the ISO (https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/232-the-conduit) the orange-red part should have a orange hue just like other weapons with obsidian.
fr I like the iso and have that variant. Might have to grind it out then
"nice work on that human! 

I'm currently working towards it."
I gotta say.. I quit..I just can't handle launchers and the shield..
Am confused human.  What happened?  Was it a glitch?
Any tips for JOKR?
"I've reached my endgame. Ak47 and renetti (I know I don't need it but I wanted to do all the dlc weapons first before getting damascus so I have it unlocked for Everything. Conpletionist mindset and whatnot lol). I've actually stopped the grind because I oddly don't want it to be over just yet?? So I'm doing my last reticle challenge now (blue dot on holographic sights, literally the worst challenge ever) and grinding obsidian on my finn and kodachis. One day I'll finish the grind. Just not today lmao."
"I wonder how many people got Damascus on this map! I started actually grinding camo�s during of a pretty lengthy shoothouse playlist draught. This map earned me so many defender and attacker kills with a launcher, as well as ground vehicle streaks"
I did all my launcher challenges except kills in ground war. I got all the kills for launchers in shipment when they added 10v10 shipment got them done in about 2 hours
*starts camo grinding in cold war*
Please activate 2 steps login in your account if you're going for damascus and dark matter.
"The camos in cold war are honestly terrible, their gold looks lacklustre next to MWs and diamond is the ugliest skin I've ever seen. The DM Ultra looks kinda cool but not worth it imo"
i quit shortly after unlocking. the grind was over
"I miss the grind, I've hardly played since I unlocked"
Yeah I quit camo grinding for that reason
Me too. I was ruining the game for myself by constantly using guns that I didn't like just to get Damascus. Quit halfway thru
I am just aiming for platinum on hand guns and snipers... I can't do Damascus nope the riot shield the launchers nope imma rage quit so... Btw well done mate
"Riot shield honestly isn't \*that\* bad. It's bad, and I had a 0.48kd with it, but like, it only took me committing to it for one day to get it gold. 3 kills without dying was by far the worst camo on that.

Launchers on the other hand.... I've been trying to do them ""Passively"", and I still haven't got my Pila gold yet, despite having platinum SMGs, Snipers/marksmans, melee and multiple gold assault rifles. They're awful, cause most of it is RNG of whether people spam killstreaks or not."
"I did riot shield last week when shipment and shoot house was on , just ask on the chat for help you gonna be surprised how many people will offer to help"
Snipers are easy in ground war. You only have to do base guns as well. Be aware that for sniper plat you need marksman rifles as well
"Good thing that i started the grind with the riot shield and the launchers, i had your same problem so i just outsmarted myself and now the first 3 plats i have are launchers, melee and AR"
Tbh I found the shield the most painful but launchers were actually really easy just time consuming. Play domination or hardpoint and have a launcher with amped on any class you use. Shoot down anything and everything and you'll get through them in no time especially if you're working on other weapons for gold / plat.
"I'm just trying to get platinum for the LMGs and SMGs

PKM and MP5 all the way"
"You may think that you can enjoy the game now, but when I got damascus all that happened was I lost all motivation to play and just waited around for Cold War"
"After the grind, I started grinding some of the DLC guns to get them gold/Damascus as well.  I also started using personal uav, the radar jamming thing and uav.  I was trying to help anyone else that needed those launcher camo's. 

I mainly did it for warzone.  That way when someone picks up the gun off my dead body they have a cool Damascus skin."
"yup this is common, the grind is the motivation"
"I just played to enjoy myself the whole time not caring about camos that frankly look meh for the most part.  
Only thing I bothered with was golden AK and RPG-7 to cosplay as an african warlord."
Now onto the DLC!
"That's what I'm doing now. 
SPR, Bruen and crossbow are still on the table.  
And an Obsidian M4 would be nice."
"Yea! This is what I did, definitely worth it. Especially the vector."
"Damn man, are you playing on sensitivity 1? :p"
My brother insists it's a pro gamer thing. I don't have the real estate for low sensitivity and honestly I don't think it helps. Especially for sharp turns.
I'm finding as I get older I have to turn the sensitivity down.
"I did this a while ago, literally all without shoot house or shipment and it's an achievement regardless. Congrats!"
"I get this is for unlocking camouflages but how do you do it, is there any tutorial or something?"
[deleted]
"Switch to double tap to mount, makes it so easy imo"
Play hardpoint and use the deployable cover field upgrade. Mounted kills are honestly not that difficult
"Im aiming for platinum on sniper, and got them all in gold but didn't get the platinum. Did anybody else have this problem? How do i solve this?"
You have to do the marksman rifles too.
That�s like having no fun at all during your entire lifetime then doing everything you missed out on when you were younger except you�re now 75 years old
Is it strange that I did launchers first or no?
No it�s better to get the worst out the way first
Congrats my dude
Tight
Welcome to the club!
"Welcome to the club, bro!"
Nice one.. I've got 2 AR and 2 SMG to do and them in done as well.
GG. I just need the ODEN and 3 LMG'S and i got Damascus aswell
What LMGs do you need?
nice bro. I got mine back in august and its the best feeling ever
This video gave me cancer
Why...? What? What happened? How?
He got Damascus. He doesn�t have to grind painful challenges now
This was my reaction after finally getting that China lake-look-a-like diamond on zombies
"Nice job! Not supposed to see a launcher as your final camo, seems to be the most-common �I got Damascus� video on here!"
"whoever tried to toss that c4 over the vendor roof at the start of the clip, that was pathetic."
Congrats dude! I gave up on this game and just run around with an aa12 and sticks
Nice!!

what if he wanted to make a friend OP? Do you think he wouldnt notice the rez
Bruh man was being friendly
What a douche
spr and as val are still incredibly OP and i think they will never be nerfed now that IW abandoned MW
spr just has non-existent ads speed and it pisses me off cause the best close quarters weapon is a fucking bolt action rifle
Yea that�s true. I unlocked the 30 rnd mag for the As Val the other day and it shreds up close. I don�t see how it�s considered a AR
The Val and spr are incredibly boring but crap players need to use them to win lol
"cod players will do anything to gain an advantage over someone else, esp in sbmm and team balancing that mw has.  People in obj modes are squaded up with that shit.  With that said I'd rather face as vals and sprs all day than no flinch tundras that's even a worse problem in cw.  At least there's no tacmask and you can actually stun and gas quick scopers and as val is nothing vs the true op mw overkill combo."
"I haven�t touched the Spr at all because I know how irritating it is to go against. And when I see someone using it, i snipe him to show it�s not that hard to kill with a one shot weapon then pull out the knife and hunt him down"
"use the fal, very good counter to the VAL imo, one head shot or 2 shots to the chest and with the right attachments it can be used like a marksman rifle"
Its been going on since the kar buff months ago. Haven't been able to play s&d since :/
I never play plant game modes but I joined a search and destroy game just to see.  Every fucking person is rocking an sbr and/or val and head glitches or hides.  It's super irritating but I guess that's just how you play if you have one life
That and CW is just trash in general
"Ehh. It�s just the snipers and lmgs are kinda taking over that game right now since these maps are built for sniping, and the no flinching doesn�t help"

"Ps4 - has been crashing on us randomly since update 1.31

I found something that helps:

Whenever the map loads I threaten my console that I'll smash it if it won't work and it seems to help 80% of the times..."
"Same here on PS4. It�s been doing it for so long, me and my wife used to play splitscreen and now it�s impossible, wasted money on a game that won�t let us play it. People that experience it need to flood Activision�s Twitter but nobody does, this bug is getting swept under the rug faster than you can say Activision sucks"
"Me and my wife have exactly the same problem on PS5, it all worked fine until the dreaded update!! I saw a work around on a Microsoft forum where someone used their phone as a hotspot so I tried it and played 5 games without a single crash, I'm not sure if it was a fluke, game was a little bit laggy but it wasn't unplayable."
I used to play mw with my brother but when entering gunfight it crashes 2 about 3 games we tried to play
Gimme a grip on my suppressor please :)
"If you use gloxina strippled grip on the other handle itll glitch and you will have no gun in game and you can sprint really fast, faster than kali sticks i believe"
"Also, modern warfare is the only game this happens on. I can play Rainbow 6 siege and any other FPS with no issue, just this game."
"Some guns are dodgy, my stepdad was levelling his ax-50 and played constantly but only went from lv 15-18 after 335 kills, Raven still haven�t fixed it, it�s just unlucky your SPR was the gun having the issue, try play warzone with it and play plunder, complete contracts whilst holding the SPR u get weapon Xp  for completed contracts"
I ran special ops in co-op to level up my guns.  You can see how much experience you�re getting each kill and you can level pretty fast.  Harbinger is a good map for leveling in special ops.
Play Hardcore or run Stopping Power rounds and Tune up perk. This will give you a one shot kill anywhere to the body.
"I usually do co op when I need. To level up a gun, it does take a little but it's also a lot easier"
i belive only the p90 and bizon cant take foregrips of any kind
Bf1 imo is much better but im a battlefield fanboy
I personally enjoy it more too. I think it was a very innovative game.
"BF1 is awesome but compared MW it has a slightly higher learning curve and plays slower. I prefer the BF style but like the more modern weapons and the gunsmith of MW.

Really looking forward to seeing what BF6 is going to be this year."
Size has nothing to do with optimization.
You know what I meant though right?
"It�s a genius marketing scheme because if you don�t buy an external harddrive you have to delete all your other games just to keep mw/Warzone. The updates have added little value to the game in terms of maps tbh, unlike Battlefield 1, and all the new guns really aren�t that good. It�s a great game tho so I bought an external harddrive so I keep bf1 and mw and some bf4"
"Technically the battle pass has content for both games, but a majority of the cosmetic items are for Black Ops. The COD points, MW vehicle skins, and stickers (I think) will work in MW. The weapons, weapon skins, operators, and operator skins will only work in Black Ops. I would hold off on buying the battle pass unless you really want the stickers or vehicle skins. If you have COD points you want to spend, I�d recommend one of the cosmetic packs from the MW store. You�d get more bang for your buck. Hope this helps"
Items in bp only work for cw
"Yes and no.

Short answer: dont buy it

The battlepass technically works with modern warfare, meaning that you can level it up by playing modern warfare, however, the battle pass doesn't have any content that's useable in modern warfare, only Warzone and BO:CW."
Warzone is free to play and separate to Modern Warfare itself. You need to buy the game separately.

I changed the password soon after i saw the emails. I thought nothing of it but tried to play today and none of my stats

Nice job that looks really cool
Thanks I�ve been doing every gun in mw pixel art
Sounds to me like you're just bad at the game.
"That, and just bad luck with SBMM."
As the other guy said sounds like you�re just bad at the game. You�re gonna stomp on people too due to sbmm how do you think they feel? Are you a prepubescent dip shit too then because you beat someone at a video game. That�s all it is a video game don�t get so mad over it.
"It�s, uh . . . it�s weird to me that losing 6 COD matches in a row is the most demotivating experience you�ve ever had. 

On the plus side, the rest of your life must be pretty smooth. I guess maybe focus on that?"
Clunky movement? Are you talking about MW or Cold War?
My bad. I posted the same thing on CW. But MW has much better movement. It's just constantly losing that's got me all frustrated.

ive gotten a trip like that
I wish this shit would happen to me.
"It's not broken. Its how it was since the start of modern warfare, to prevent stacking that huge XP drop with XP tokens."
Basically you can delete this post lmao
"I don't know, I was able to get 2XP last time I did the trials (seasons 5 and 6) and it doubled the 3 star reward. And I remember seeing guides say trials was the best way to jumpstart a season of MW with easy XP using 2XP tokens.

edit: if it wasn't meant to double certain XP gains while doubling other XP gains it shouldn't make the player think it will double every XP. It doesn't work as intended here."
"Spec ops is your best use of 2xp tokens. Operation kavulda (I think, the one where you mark caches in a compound) will net you 100-120k xp for 10 minutes. It's nuts."
I�ll check that out. But that means I have to reinstall spec ops LUL
"While doing a leisurely run through season 1's shooting range from MW you SHOULD receive 10k XP when you get 3 stars. I turned on 2XP to get 20k XP. That should happen. But, as you can see in the video, it LITERALLY DIVIDED THE 3 STAR REWARD INTO 2 TO PASS OFF AS 2XP.

&#x200B;

Now, I haven't done any trials since season six of MW, but I was quite disappointed to see that, for one, I couldn't even use a 2xp token unless I switched to BOCW, activate the token, and then switch back to utilize it. Secondly, it didn't even grant the double XP.

&#x200B;

Why do I think it is the way it is? Well, if it isn't on purpose, then it's to drive people to want to play the BOCWs trials to give them the adequate 2XP (untested), which in turn would help drive sales of that game up. All I'm saying is, I love this game, and it saddens me that Activision wants to simply make their customers forget about it."
it's been like this before warzone was a thing
Double xp for trials only works when there is a double xp event. Tokens don�t work. This is how it�s been and how you saw people get double trial xp.
"I�ve seen anecdotal evidence of it being the opposite, and I personally experienced it the other way around too, back in seasons 5 and 6"
How i earn tickets?
"Battle pass, challenges, and level up iirc"
It's good. I just wish it was in the hardcore playlist as I only really play hardcore.
Think they missed a trick with this map. Coulda been 5v5 mayhem like shipment.
"Oh yeah definitely, but I kinda like 4v4 they literally should just make a �fan favourite mode� with shipment, rust, livestock, shoot house. Or something and keep it permanent."
"That was a hell of a flick n hit lol, good stuff!!"
"thanks man! glad i clipped it, i tried describing these kinds of kills to my friend but he didn�t get it. right in front of them but they never see you, you know? lol"
"Fucking sick

Edit:  wanted to add:  Those are the kind of deaths I can�t even be mad about lol"
right? lol they always hear me say �what the fuck� then i�m spectating
"I was running to the objective to stop the capture and figured what�s the worst that could happen...fired, and came to the realization that walls are just arbitrary."
are you sure you hit the person capping? you were firing right at a corner of the little house where people like to camp
"Yes, MW is still very relevant and still easy to find lobbies. The best way to enjoy MW is to try and play a few CW games first, then hop into MW and marvel at how it is objectively better in almost every way possible."
"The game is still really relevant. I have no issues getting into lobbies, and honestly it�s still really fun. I tried playing CW. Though the game just  didn�t feel that skill based. I returned to MW after a week of CW and I�m having more fun playing than before."
"I played CW when I got it for my bday in Nov ,played a few maps mainly Nuketown for a few weeks hoping it would eventually get better , it didn�t and I�ve been back on MW ever sense ."
Still playing every night
I still play this game but I might have to delete it because its taking up a lot of space and I have to share this ps4 with my brothers.
I still have a base ps4 and mw was the sole reason I got an extended storage 7 years later lol. I do love what they did on the ps5 how you can save all your ps4 games on the extended storage
"
Good to know that helps"
Yeah except there�s new glitches. Just today I took so long to load into a game that I was kicked for inactivity before I even got to spawn in
"Best game ever.
Still have many players.
Very nice game.
I have no problem ...
Enjoy.."
Thanks everyone
"Because MW is still the boss even so they have been trying to make CW ro take over. Good luck.

But even MW is just almost perfect with cross-play disabled so you don't cross PC players with their cheating bullshit. I can only play multiplayer with cross-play disabled. Warzone is a mess anyways full of cheat. Multiplayer is so much fun."
GUY HAS A BUILT IN AIM ASSIST AND IS COMOLAINING ABOUT CHEATERS. GO FIGURE
Hard to find lobbies with cross play turned off and many cheaters when it's cross lobbies
Why do you ask on the internet and wait for responses instead of simply starting the other game to check it ou by yourself? do you call random persons to ask them to check if your letter box contains letters as well?
Sorry just wondering
"Nope, nobody at all plays it. If you join a game right now you'll be the only one in there."
"sure, go on with your bullshit."
"Warzone is a better game than both MW/CW tbh, it's clear that classic CoD is dead sadly. Warzone is gonna be Activision's gold goose for a while. My only problem is Raven really sucks at keeping hackers out. It's also free which is good, because I won't buy another game unless it's a MW2/BO2 remaster at this point."
"If you strongly suspect your account was compromised you have to connect to the following link to submit an account recovery request: [https://support.activision.com/account-recovery](https://support.activision.com/account-recovery)

Already did that. Thanks for the concern.
Talked shit and got hacked lol karmas a bitch.
This isn�t karma if the time I spent working on game progression can be erased in a minute by some salty player.
Yep
u get some cod point and banner for MW :-)
"Lesson learned last season. Cold War is not as good, kind feels cartoonist. The franchise has gone backwards."
"Yep, because MW is only the advertisment platform for ColdWar and warzone (it even lost its own name in the launcher). No one of the devs would suspect that a MW2019 multiplayer player wants to play multiplayer in MW2019 (and wants content for that) eventhough ColdWar and warzone exists. Did I mention that ColdWar and Warzone are the current support games where you should put your money in?"
Youll get 1300 in CP so you can still spend the money but all the stuff included can only be used in WZ or CW
"as macklemore said, that's called being swindled by a business."
Technically you get like 2-3 vehicle skins that are made for modern warfare.
Lol
"Okay thank you all for the info! Now im up to speed what's going on with this clustertruck franchise.

Yeah, im that weird guy who just loves CoD:MW public TDM! Best game in the franchise. Current CoD situtiation isn't looking good for me it seems.

CoD: Cold War is just horrible, it reminded me that i was playing Action Quake with a fancy graphix.

Warzone on the other hand is a battle royal game, and i truly hate those all.

There is still a lot of players on the MW TDM front that even surprises me!

That lead me to get the pass like it was a season 1 all over again, i fell in a marketing trap. So lets just see when the game dies, im playing CoD:MW TDM till the end! 

&#x200B;

Have a good day there you all! GL HF!"

"This happened to me, account was hacked Nov 24, banned Nov 26 (account hacker was also game hacking). Reported it Nov 25, got that same email you did late February. Went on to the support site and waited two hours in queue for a tech to help me. Explained my situation and he fixed it. Got all my stuff back and everything, all my load outs were switched but that was an easy fix. Good luck!"
I also got in contact them via the site but they wanted to know if i knew the new name of my hacked account. Like how would I know... So they said i just had to be patient. Idk can't really be that hard to get my account back if it got hacked right. 4 months waiting now
I've never seen such slow reaction time in a lobby before in my life. What's your smurfs kd
"lmao this was actually live, just got lucky with the lobby. 1 sweat, and 3 randoms camping in the back idk man"
i got to 25 kills on livestock but the match ended. the enemies were not really good so im quite confident i would have been able to drop a nuke
"Bruh, great job!

First nuke post I've seen here which isn't from spawn fucking the enemies in groundwar!

Love this map."
appreciated!

Take my upvote here since I can�t upvote the original one.
It doesn�t. You missed it
No the black skin for roze was in the battle pass.
Wasn�t the black skin tier 100 on battle pass?
Yeah black skin was on the battle pass you missed it bud
Well them �some kids� are correct! Now take your way back to the cod website and apologise to them

"Had this when doing spec-ops with a friend.  I�m 99% sure it�s something fucky with the infil cutscenes at the start of the game.  I am unsure if there is any way to fix it from happening, BUT you can get your FoV back to normal by simply doing any intro infil cutscene (for example, booting up a custom game and watched the infil cutscene and then leaving.)"

"with aim assist, half the playerbase could make that shot :P"
Rockets are going to be the death of you. Shoot The Ship 24/7 or Rust 24/7 should be a permanent playlist on Modern Warfare multiplayer. Activision has already made it apparent that the only thing they're interested in is Warzone or Black Ops after the slaps to the face they called the Battle Pass season 1 and 2. Might as well give us what the community wants and just cycle one of those modes once a week.
"Yeah I know about the launchers, they are gonna be the death of me lol. Especially the JOKR"
ur doing great sweetie x
"hipfire build is very fun. use the .41 ae ammo, 5mw laser, no stock, merc foregrip and stippled grip. hipfire is so accurate with the uzi that you can easily kill people 15 meters away"
"Hmm, that seems fun"
"I personally like using the new barrel and ammo conversion w/ a tac foregrip, no stock, and a g.I. Reflex because I don�t really like the sights. It works decently well for me, but I hope this helps"
"https://i.imgur.com/qloB6v8.jpg  I switch between SOH/Fully Loaded depending on the map. The range on this setup is unreal, you can beam snipers with it all day long."
"I use the pro barrel, AE rounds, stippled, mini reflex and SoH"
"Mono suppressor, sleight of hand, .41 AE ammo. Longer or shorter barrel, depending on what I want to use it for, but I usually just stick with those 3 attachments"
"Mono, FSS carbine pro, .41 AE, commando grip, rubber wrap"
"People definitely move different than npc�s. Best thing that got me better was dropping semi hot and play unpredictable. You got the bonus of wanting to play cod online, so just camp! But like all things bud practice makes perfect!"
"I don't know what ""dropping semi hot"" means, but I played a bit more weirdly after your suggestion and did better. I think an LMG as my gun o' choice helped too."
"One issue with playing offline all the time is you have a near 0 ping with bots so hit registration will be high which makes it more difficult to adjust to a server full of random ping players. 

As a PC player the first thing I had to forget in MW2019 was K/D ratios and find ways to have fun. For me that is running around and stabbing campers currently. 

Find a few weapons that you are good with and stick with them and if you get bored try something new. I just use the M4A1 for longer range and the MP5 / Shotgun for close quarters."
"Offline really isn't good practice for online.

Online is probably good practice for offline though."
"Fellow OLDER GAMER PERSON I guess...Are you playing on PC ? I use both keyboard and mouse but I find the controller superior thanks to the auto-aim. Playing on PS4..the game is smoother on the console IMO. 

Anyway I have plenty of bad matches but also a lot of good ones. I perform far worse when I am frustrated. So I take break..maybe a few minutes, hours or days and come back. It helps.

I also play a lot of objective-based matches where campaign and quick reflexes are not as prominent.

Also there's nothing wrong playing offline mode. I love playing against the bots at my own pace and comfort : ) sometimes I just want to call in helicopter gunships all day."
"It's a really interesting discussion point.

I spent my younger gaming years on a PC, and my adult gaming years are console-based. When I play single player, sometimes I play a few missions on regular/medium level and enjoy the auto-aim, but the vast majority of the time I play on the hardest difficulty without any auto-aim or HUD.

I've generally found that shooters are OK on a controller, but the biggest change has been that I've pretty much abandoned strategy games like AOE/Starcraft/C&C that I used to love! Although TBH that's not entirely my fault...

I don't know what the majority of COD players use, but I assumed consoles w/ controllers.

Edited to make it clear that I play hard difficulty on \*single\* player."
"As far as MP advice goes, you'll be shit at the start, everyone is but especially a year into the game when everyone knows the maps and has their strategies down. I'd suggest playing different modes like gun game, it's a way to get to know the maps without constantly dying, the players are generally less sweaty/more casual and it puts you on a level playing field since everyone has to work their way through the same guns. 

TDM and all the objective based modes are definitely harder to learn now, because of the aforementioned strategy lock-in with a lot of players. What I'll say is that weapon choice matters so much, LMGs are exceedingly rare in MP because the ADS time is glacial and vs players with fast SMG builds you're going to die absolutely every single time unless you spend the round on your belly in a corner. Loadout building is something of an art but the general rule I use is the higher I can get the mobility (aka ADS time) and control ratings, the better off I am."
"Warzone is a lot about tactics, where TDM, Demolition, Domination etc are more like we know from Quake and CS. Practice, practice, practice.

Watch videos about warzone tactics, and eventually you will get better.

The sad thing is; we�re getting old, and we don�t have the reaction speed of a teenager who can nut inbetween spawns..."
"Can't a 100GB - 500GB game like COD MW offer the same if not more modes than its 100MB - 500MB ancestors, Unreal Tournament? Team Fortress? CS? Quake III Arena?

Perhaps there's also the problem that I don't want to have to level up in order to be able to put some sight or grip on my gun.

((Unreal Tournament's ""Assault"" for some reason never caught on, despite being the best large-scale online FPS experience of all time...!))"
F
Were you using 2fa?
Yes I was I�ve been using it ever since I got the game
Daughter had the same thing happen. Write off to them (instructions on the site for when accounts have been hacked) and they will sort it out. She got hers back with her Damascus unlocks and all her COD points still intact. Took about 8 days.
"Thanks for this it�s reassuring although I think my hand is broken, things like this shouldn�t even happen especially with 2fa, glad her account got sorted out hopefully mine can too. Take care mate"
"Damn, they did nothing for me ..."
Ain�t this warzone
"Its warzone, as part of MW. It checks out."

"if you don't have any missions unlock from previews battle passes you can't I've just complete 2 of them this week from the s5 battlepass(im on xbox but I sometimes use mouse and keyboard to use the menus) and previously during season 1 of Cold War missions apear for Wyatt,minoatur,etc those weren't suppose to be there since they were season 1 battle pass skin and they will be on the store"
"So you're saying i need to unlock the missions in the battle pass? And now with the new season the missions i saw from the previous is gone? Wtf activision i thought the missions were tied to the operators and not the stupid battle pass. 

Thanks for clearing that up for me bro."
It sucks that support seems like it got dropped on release of CW but it is Activision so it doesn't surprise me. If Battlefield 6 is as good as Battlefield 3/4 cod might lose me for a year or two depending on how much EA puts in to it.
Seems like EA is really taking their time w it so honestly it might b really good... who knows tho
"It definitely surprised me how different it was from previous COD games. It really was meant to be more of a mil-sim shooter than the ol� arcade game it originated as. It was the most fun I had from the previous games (aside from campers, but MW was made to be campy), and it�ll have a place in my heart where it was one of the best Call of Duty games made."
"Peolle tend to forget just how campy MW2 was and still is. The games share a lot of similarities like big complex maps, broken metas, short ttk and even a similar love-hate relationship that many people have with it"
"I stopped buying cod games since bo1, but mw 2019 is so good I just had to get it.

So far, my favorite cod game yet! Combat just feels so good. Even my SO who hates FPS loves playing MW 2019 with me.

I have played CW for a bit during the free week. It�s not a bad game as this sub makes it out to be but MW 2019 feels so much better

It�s sad MW 2019 is not being worked on much but I�ll still play it this year and maybe next too"
"> sad to think that infinity ward is just going to abandon it like ~~it was nothing~~ every other cod

I enjoyed the game when I could play small maps and people didn't camp much, gun feel/animations/graphics are top notch, but I just couldn't play more after season 6"
"After being  a core CS:GO then some Halo, MW4 I find MW 2019 a great game, smooth flow, great gun handling.   I've read that there actually might be some new content dropping on Mar 11th. Article in Gamerant mentioned a reliable leaker said that it's coming. we can hope. 

I'm encouraged to keep playing because of posts like this confirm the community is out there for the game."
"SBMM is a major bonerkiller for this game, same with the map design (its not all bad but sbmm makes it worse). Other than that, best cod game in years, probably one of the best."
"Feel the same, the last CoD I played was Black Ops 1, then this game felt like the perfect sequel to the OG MW and now thats just it...just shouldve expanded on this game instead of doing another one..."
it's also been happening to me since december and then started giving me memory errors every other game. I just stopped playing since the game is literally unplayable for me now and I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the game 3 times and factory reset my ps5 which did absolutely nothing lol. It seems like there isn't really a fix and all we can do is wait and hope they fix it eventually but I doubt that's ever gonna happen.
It�s all Cold War - can only equip to CW weapons. Completely worthless in this game
"In other words to get the ""free"" stuff ya need to drop 60 quid.. jeez this is nearly EA level, very scummy to me.."
The whole Season 2 tier progression thing is to get you to buy CW so you can use the stuff in it.
Wow... that's just scummy to me..
"u/atviassist

I didn�t play MW for 2-3 months, and when some friends invited me to get back on, everything was gone. I had multiple guns gold, lots of guns max level, lots of blueprints, character skins, sprays, and other items. Some were even paid for. I used to play this game A LOT so I had lots of stuff unlocked. 

After waiting ~10 days for my account to be recovered to another email, I log in and there is still nothing. The only thing that changed was the activision account name. This is bullshit, I spent DAYS of my time grinding to unlock this stuff and now it�s just gone? 

Also, the activision website is beyond terrible. Using it in chrome is fully impossible. When I click the log in or sign up buttons at the top right corner, it just opens a new tab of the same exact site. There is quite literally no way to login on their website unless you use microsoft edge.

Also, I can not get in contact with support. That screen with the �loading agent chat� message has been like that for about 20 minutes now. Last time, it instantly switched to a page showing me how many people were ahead of me in the queue(150!!!!). Even then, it took me literal hours of waiting until I finally was able to talk to a real human.

I want my stuff back. Anyone know of a way to contact activision? This is ridiculous"
"I guess we'll find out on Thursday. But the complete lack of any info from either iw or raven/ Activision is not looking good. And the fact that these have been in the game fully usable for over 2 months and we haven't gotten a single bit of official info on them makes me never want to buy another Activision product. Modern warfare has been the best cod in the last 10 years and the most fun I've had in cod ever, and Activision wants to abandon this one too try and sell copies of their dogshit cold war isn't helping to say people to buy cw, its just passing off their mw fan base. The whole situation is fucked"
"It is, but remember that the SMG and LMG are now ground loot in warzone, so it shouldn�t be far behind."
Dont buy activision. I stopped after the whole ActiBlizz Hong Kong fiasco. Buy the games used if you really want to play them.
10 years later....
"Hopefully soon here, it's been **months**. :("
We�ll see next Thursday if it�s true or not
"If the CX9 and the RAAL stay as powerful in Warzone as they are now, then I'll be very surprised. Everything from Acti/IW so far has suggested they want full focus on Cold War and Warzone. Adding two new powerful MW guns would encourage everyone to go back to MW to level them."
all three guns look to be meta breaking in warzone lol
Wow it even says season 1 in the image. They were so clearly planned for CW season 1 but delayed. Goddammit
That and other stuff like Iskra Winter Skin are labeled as Season 1
Really hope you are right
"This is my take: these were part of a planned season 7, that would�ve gotten released if Cold War launch and/or season 1 launch got delayed. Season 7 was a backup plan. They got some of the work done for that season (these 2 guns, without multiplayer or warzone balancing done), while other parts were abandoned (new map, mid-season gun/melee weapon releases, etc) when it was looking more and more likely that Treyarch and Raven were going to meet their deadlines. 

These 2 guns are basically abandonware at this point.  IW has no reason to do additional work on these to finish them, as they�re already working on their next game, and Raven�s roadmap is already filled with Cold War content. 

Edit: alternatively, season 7 could�ve been part of the original roadmap, but because the previous season launches were always pushed out by at least a week or 2 due to delays, season 7 was pushed out too far to be fully completed before it bumped against the Cold War schedule. 


Source: I have experience with general web development roadmaps and product life cycles"
No one is saying they don�t exist. They�re casting doubt on a �leaker� that has been wrong twice so far when it comes to when this content will be released.
TGR? Very reliable source tho
it's gonna be a warzone event but guns usable in mp most likely
"Nice how it says Season 1, as in it was clearly supposed to come out on Season 1 of BOCW, but Raven just fucked up really hard like they always do in MW lately"
Finally now this subreddit would stop crying
"The shop is set on rotation, it will come back"
Ah okay thanks
I still don't have s1 bundles in the store. Lucky u
I�ll call you lucky as I haven�t even seen that bundle.
Are you on ps5/ps4?
PS4
"The crucial element you�re missing here is that this isn�t modern warfare. Hasn�t been for nearly a year. It�s Warzone. And until it becomes its own standalone application we�re gonna have to deal with them integrating the yearly titles, whether we like it or not. 

No one is pretending MW doesn�t exist, but as it stands now it is the native application for Warzone. 

The reason MW never received the 7th season isn�t Cold War btw. It�s because of several delays in earlier seasons that threw their dates off course. 

Why they didn�t combine it with the 6th season is a question that only IW can answer. They knew since early last year they wouldn�t have been able to make the date."
"Bro, thank you man honest to god you have to be one of the smartest people in this sub by both defending mw and cold war at the same time take my fckin award bro"
"No I�m not saying that Cold War killed season 7. If they want to have that game that�s fine, but don�t keep putting advertisements in my face to buy Cold War when I�m playing Modern Warfare"
">And until it becomes its own standalone application

This will literally never happen, Modern Warfare needs the Warzone game files to function, warzone stores all the guns, operators etc while MP only needs to have the MP maps in it, basically."
"This is a crazy. Yo didn�t even complain about how bad of a game Cold War is. Good job 
Every one else always craps on cw, bi you didn�t"
"So this is going to happen continually, the COD series alternates, since Warfare will be cross series they will integrate the new, decommission the old, and then bring in the next games stuff... 

Think of warfare like an MMO at this point..."
"For context, this guy was bullying me with his riot shield the previous game"
"That�s all I�ve been doing all weekend, almost deleted cold war because they made livestock 4v4. Only problem is if you have a party it�s easy to spawn trap when you stand near the tractor and they spawn over in the back by the trailer and they spawn even if you�re looking at them i figured it out quick and got like a 20 streak from watching people spawn. It�s like a half a nuketown type map."
Oh and i find games faster and run into less hackers on mw. I was having fun on livestock and decided to take that fun attitude over to nuketown on cold war and ran into a hacker first game.
"oh yeah, I was just playing Cold War even when shoot the ship was out since it was getting boring tbh. Livestock made me remember how much I love modern warfare. Tbh I only liked nuketown on bo3 but to be fair that was my first nuketown as well haha"
No hardcore :(
The main problem I have is just people running around on top. If you don�t have control over that it�s just a nuisance
"Livestock ain�t too bad tbh, not quite as versatile for multi challenges like shoothouse and not quite as fast paced as shipment but it�s a decent map. Grind is awful on it tho"
"Love livestock - got 2 VTOLs on hardpoint the other day, ended with 56 kills"
Cracked my guy
The turn around no scope to the window had it for me good shiet
Genetically ***lucky*** more like it haha
Just don't play that fucking garbage ass map. That's how I get around it. Sad as it is.
average hardcore player
At the end of the day it�s just a game.  Roll with the punches.  OSRS RuneScape is still pretty good.
"Free for all spawns are random bro, no teams no spawn switching"
"Yeah but come on, there's like 10 people in the games, it can be better if they were actually trying"
"Spawns have been bad since COD4.  


BTW, CW spawns are just as bad."
Tbh it�s worse. Because their buildings are made of paper and anyone camping with an LMG will light you up right as you spawn no matter the distance or obstacles.
"These spawns are especially bad, you'll walk past a area that was clear literally 1 sec ago then boom, shot in the back. Really just kills the fun, people just leave the games most of the times too."
"Just don�t play free for all it�s that easy. And you shouldn�t expect shipment or rust spawns to be good, because they�re tiny square maps with no space for spawns and aren�t meant to be legitimate competitive maps"
"I just played what the game gave me, but the spawns just make people leave and kill the fun"
Pls watch. Thanks
"M91.

The SA-87 and the Holger are not amazing, but at least they're closed bolt and fire instantly.

The MG34 and the PKM are top tier weapons and I love them for what they can do.

The M91 is worse than both the PKM and the MG34 while still retaining the open bolt delay on the first shot that can cost you your life. And I never managed to make a build that retains a semblance of range while having good ADS time.

It's got a really good model tho (especially with some of the battle pass skins) and it sounds pretty neat."
"Good analysis, agreed. I know the SA-87 has some big drawbacks but it�s an extremely consistent weapon, considering you only need 3 hits anywhere in the body to kill at any range."
"spot on. I didn't mention the bolt delays, but it's a great point."
For the handful who voted PKM: why?
Haters
"I run LMGs almost exclusively, M91 for sure.

SA87 is a reliable 3-shot, since the buff it can also 3-shot limbs. It's much better than people think. Slow ROF but a very forgiving reload if you're used to LMGs.

MG34 trades everything for TTK. Reload is painful. It has the most weighted attachments when considering ADS times, so if you build it slow, it's really slow, but if you throw a short barrel and no stock on it it's not bad at close range. It's not a fantastic gun but I've put a lot of time into it and I think it has a place if you like playing with friends. You have to run the 100 round, and I even run 100 round + fast hands on one of my blueprints.

PKM is good. Not much to say, it kills nearly as fast the MG34 and it has faster ADS, better reload. Snatch grip is great, but it's worth noting that commando foregrip is so good for long-range that I run them interchangeably (Snatch is the go-to for regular 6v6 though).

M91 does not get limb 3-hits, fires slower than anything BUT the SA87 (not counting base finn, I would have to double check though), has recoil that is vertical but not insignificant, and has the stand-out feature of having the longest 3-hit chest range. That's it. I don't think it's worth it at all."
"It's amazing how many votes there are against the SA87, it really can't seem to shake its poor reputation that at this point is *months and months* out of date."
"I'll add that if I were to rank them, I would put them in the order PKM, MG34, SA87, M91. I'd still take the MG34 over the SA87, but I think there is reasonable debate there. Also I personally use the MG34 over the PKM because while the PKM is brilliant, I like the MG34. It's like the PKM with gigantic clown shoes.

If you were to include the DLCs, I would put the FINN and the Bruen right up at the top, and the Holger would sit next to or just behind the SA87. It's fine, but it's not great at anything and it doesn't get a long barrel. Big sad. (EDIT: On second thought I'd easily put the Holger behind the SA87)

The M91 isn't absolute garbage, but part of the issue here is that a lot of the LMGs are really similar. Without a feature that defines them they don't feel like a good option. Plus, when the RAAL releases I fully expect it to be dominant based on the currently available stats. You're looking at a 2-shot body. The Gorgon returns (please let this release Thursday)."
"FiNN shoots a *little* bit slower than the M91, but not by much, and it also handles and reloads faster, has better recoil, and better irons"
"Non-dlc would be the M91 without a doubt.

With DLC 100% the Holger. I enjoy using it from the time to time and it�s not bad in HC built as an SMG, but in core it�s dreadful and will lose to almost anything"
"I beg to differ, you can actually make a great AR out of it."
"nah, Holger is among the better LMGs. it handles just about like an SMG, while retaining damage, recoil and range from an LMG. It's not very strong up close (more like grau territory), but at mid to long ranges it's very competitive

[If you want to see what a good player can do with it, here](https://youtu.be/h451KLluzPk)"
"i voted for the mg34 because its not versatile at all. it only has good ttk but the mag size and reload is horrendous. the m91 is just mediocre, but at least its good at long range"
"I feel the mg34 is the worst just out of pure salt that it looks and sounds so cool but handles so slowly haha. it absolutely tears people in half, but you have to run *ALL* mobility attachments if you want it to handle acceptably, and even with SoH the reload is murderously slow"
"I don't know why, but the MG-34 is my favorite LMG to use."
"SA87 arguably the best LMG

Holger would also be decent with the insane movement speed, though it's DLC

PKM is pretty much alright, typical LMG

MG34 is just too slow and clunky for most purposes, but at least it kills

M91 is bad at everything. it's slow, it shoots marshmallows, there's nothing redeeming about this gun and clear choice for worst gun"
For sure the SA87. It�s basically just an AR with the movement speed and ads speed of an LMG. In my opinion it�s easily one of the 3 worst weapons in the entire game.
"You're wrong. The SA87 absolutely slaps. Sure the handling is a little slow but the ttk is great. It's a solid gun

Worst LMG is easily the M91. It's just worse than the PKM in every way."
Sa87 has a 3 shot kill up to insane ranges and has no open bolt delay.
The MG34 was in my opinion the worst gun to get gold it is SO fucking BAD.
Good damage though
Mg34 is by far the worst don�t know how you can argue otherwise.
Extremely good TTK that can shred enemies like wet paper if you set it up correctly.
"Depends on your play style and the map. Slower pace longer range, yes. Sweat drop shot hop reload mid air hip fire headshot switch to dual pistols knife kill, no."
It melts when playing hardcore mode.
"it's good when it works. my main issue is that the recoil on it is so inconsistent i miss way too many shots sometimes. it's good if it's the only gun you use during a full play session, because you get used to it, but the recoil pattern kills it for me"
It just needs like a light damage buff or a little fire rate buff and it could be decent but I like using it anyway
"I think when I was going for Damascus it was the first gold smg I got, even though I didn't need to. I really do love the striker"
i often get 2 second lags when spawning. its not a problem on regular maps but on shipment it got killed a lot
"Yup, I have the 3080 and it�s the same for me"
"This started happening to me after the latest update, i've tried like 10 different solutions in threads dating back to the beta. Hopefully someone knows a workaround and can post it in here"

Loadout/setup?
I have no faith left and the new guns imo won�t really fill the void that�s left by desiring new content or dedicated playlists or just being able to choose to not play the shit maps.
There are 3 unreleased guns that have been in the game for months now. Ive been hoping and waiting.
"I want to believe it, but i'm done getting my hopes up"
March 11th is update day so that could be possible but not the 10th
"Gotcha, wrong date, my b."
"Well considering he changed the date on that from December 10 to the midseason update in January and neither of those happened I�d take it with a grain of salt. 

People take update days and then �predict� something will come and if they�re right they get praised if not they delete their tweets (as this guy did) and move onto the next update day."
Same thing doomsday cults leaders do. Sad that people still follow.
If only
"They might add the guns to the game that were unreleased, but some people are hyping up the 11th to be the start of a new season for MW only with new content or some BS like that. I dont get why they buy into youtuber clickbait hype. It'll probably just be one last major update to fix bugs and address issues and maybe the guns and that will probably be about it."
"Yeah I�m not really hoping for anything huge, at least the new weapons and (hopefully) new ops."
Its my favourite gun in the game! I got ~25k kills with it. I think I also use the same set up as you if the last attachment is stippled grip? With viper optic though.
My favourite is always M13
"Every gun is good is you are a good player. . After all the nerfs and balances, the games in a good place"
"I think, if the AS VAL caught a small nerf, the game would be really balanced imo."
"With the right setup it can be very good, but not the most mobile.  I loved it on shipment and had it as part of my spammer load out, when people would spawn camp. Fully loaded, flash bangs, with tear gas tactical�s.  Usually put a stop to that nonsense."
really? I thought one of its strong suits was its high mobility.

"mono suppressor, commando grip, gi mini sight, 50 round mag, stippled grip"
The Ram is good but with the 50 round mag. IMO its almost like it fires too quickly and I find myself reloading too frequently with the 30 rounds. Kinda like the fennic without the 40 rounds mag.
My personal favorite and I wish more guns had a similar yellow-ish good luck charm skin like it has from the Rainbow Tactical pack.
"use to be the best ar in the game, then the val cameout"
man those tracers look odd
"Just got it golden yesterday.

Does it�s job well, but I feel the M13 is better in some cases. It�s in no means bad, just more recoil than the M13, but with more damage."
"its very good, but i still think the m4 is better because of the better recoil and bigger available mag. the better ROF of the ram is not really that noticable IMO.

edit: also i dont really like the ram ironsights"
And this is why you should always be a decent router instead.
"It was a firmware issue only with this game, and it also wasn't my choice since it was bought by a tech illiterate family member who wouldn't even let me change the password from the cluster fuck of letters on the back of the modem"
Options > Audio > Mute all but party chat
"I�ll give that a shot, thanks"
"this works, but also mutes your own team (unless they're partied with you) and you're unable to un-mute them"
Same issue but no solution. Gonna try the �mute all but party� setting
"cant wait to see you playing for optic, you have incredible potential"
Thank you. Would really appreciate if you could subscribe on YouTube and leave a like. Thanks again for leaving a comment
"Sameeee, how do they keep breaking this game"
You need to get into a lobby to use them
Strange didn't used to be like that
Yeah once you�re que�d up you can activate them.
"Happened to me the same day Season 4 came out (June 2020 I think?). I lost my Damascus, battle pass items, and cosmetic purchases. I talked to activision almost everyday and they never resolved my issue. I�m still getting emails today talking about �Due to high volume, your account recovery is taking longer than usual and will require another 5 business days�."
"i was hacked at some point also. Tried to start playing WZ with friends again a few days ago and had nothing. Waiting still to hear anything after a few days. 

Account was maxed out essentially with damascus camo and everything. very annoying there isnt a better way to go about this"
Feel for you man! There customer service is terrible all the time there live chat hours are open they�re busy!
"Same boat dude I was even removed mid game with my friend when my account was hacked and unlinked, it�s been 3 weeks and I�ve had nothing back from Activision.

Wouldn�t care so much but I�d spent a lot of money on that account had nearly all diamond/platinum guns, what annoys me the most is knowing someone is probably running around on my account right now using skins with money I spent from my own pocket. Selfish and thieving fucking twats the lot of them, and activision are just as bad for their abysmal support. I�ve moved onto other games and give up."
"So shit! The worst bit about it is all the hours and money put in to it all gone, looks like they�re not much help in getting them back either"
"I won�t hold much hope then, have u started again or just given up completely?"
"Xbox game bar is included with windows 10. Ctrl + window key + g. Set your ""record this"" to record the past 30 seconds or 1 minute in settings. Edit: it works the same as xbox one"
"This, this, this."
"found it, great.

This is great, it helps so much...it was just not worth the time to waste with OBS (and poor quality)"
i use Nvidia auto replay and just bind a key on my keyboard to record the last minute.
If you have nvidia just use Geforce Experience. You can save I think up to 20 mins of your last gameplay or choose to start recording whenever you want and it whenever you want
You should be using geforce experience for visual filters anyway. Either use the auto-record option for kills etc or just use shadowplay to record the last few minutes (you choose how long those clips are) with alt+f10.
They should just bring back theater mode.
"your just console trash unable to use google lmao

its you not your pc"
Y so hostile man
Hardcore is great because you can legit run pistols and not be at a big disadvantage.
"Pistols are OP in HC. At longer ranges is the only time you might lose out. Otherwise, become a quick aim one tap god"
"Why? I don�t want to be rude but do you happen to camp with IAVs or use transport chopper to get to rooftop and camp? If so then I�d never want IAV campers and rooftop campers back, those thing are literally aids."
"No, i like the playstyle it made me play and also to use cruise missile only for the tanks"
"I hope it doesn�t if I�m honest, snipers and campers literally suck the fun out it. Wait for it...wait for it...�JuSt GeT gUd�"
Uh oh no free streaks? Rip heli tho
"Never used them myself as i hate being ""carried"" by vehicels, but i loved using cruise missile on them and to play around it"
"I really damn hope it never comes back. Vehicles are motorized cancer. I wish bf6 never adds them, but they will"
"Imo the game is sooo worth it, infinitely better than Cold War although others beg to differ, with the packs yea you look cool but at the end of the day your only gonna use one skin really unless your willing to switch skin consistently without forgetting, I recommend the mil sim pack with the thunderclap m4 if anything, only way to counter the black roze skins, but back on topic, instead of getting skins the game for �60 grants you an entire campaign although you know this already, full access to missed guns like the Amax and Grau, an entire coop spec ops section of the game and the survival mode although it�s dodgy af. All this puts infinitely more hours into something productive over getting bored of the repetitiveness of warzone, good to switch up sometimes I find"
Fair arguments
As someone who enjoys both Cold War and MW. I would definitely agree that MW is still worth it. It�s a blast and seems a bit better optimized for PC than Cold War.
"the only milsim pack i can find is the grom one, is there another one you�re referring to?"
"Only like 4-5 maps are playable. The majority of its maps are large sweaty campfests with tons of visual clutter. I suggest you stick to Warzone (if you hate CW), or maybe try a different shooter"
"Multiplayer is terrible one of the worst and the campaign is one of the best ever, there probably wont be any new content for this game imo"
Idk warzone is good mw multiplayer is better than cold wars but outbreak is fun
"Definitely worth it. Some will fight with me on this but it�s easily the overall best installation in the CoD series. Game is still populated although on occasion the server traffic is too high causing lag. Sometimes you�ll have weeks straight of no issues at all and sometimes you�ll have several days where you�re experiencing it. It�s extremely inconsistent.

Worth mentioning, two new 6V6 maps, two new Gunfight maps and 3 new weapons are rumored to be scheduled for this Thursday."
The question is how much longer will it be populated? Atleast 3 months?
"It's worth 2nd hand if you can get a good price, I suspect the player base will stay around for maybe another year as it's a solid game imo"
"Literally the only game I've played for the past two years, love it despite any issues there have been, I've never played a mill sim game that had such a good ""feel"" it's really worth it"
uhhhhhhhhh since when is COD a mil sim???
"Definitely modern Warfare worth buying 
I enjoy it very much.
I have no problem with the game.
I hope they provide more content for him."
"really depends on if you think multiplayer will be worth the price. there�s not really gonna be any new content coming to MW as it is over a year old. but it currently does have more maps, guns and overall polish than CW. campaign is also pretty good if you�re into that."
"Always will be, having in mind that CoD will not reach this kind of glory until a second part of MW comes around. The next title is being developed by Sledgehammer, and we all know what that is like"
"If you loved the beta, then it's absolutely worth buying imo, since you already know that you like the core gameplay. 

The game is still very populated. Because CoD games sell so much, every game keeps a strong population for at least 2 years, and it's still large enough to find a match many years later (I booted up WW2 recently just for kicks and still found games). And MW in particular was such a mega hit that I imagine it'll remain very active until the next MW game releases - MW2020 was the second best selling game of 2021 (the year after it launched)!

And at this point in the game's life cycle, all of the content has already been released. For some people that's a negative, but for me it's a positive, since the game is filled to the brim with content currently and nothing is a timed exclusive anymore.

Lastly, the campaign is incredible. I think most people will agree the campaign is pretty good, but I simp for that campaign, I think it's the best in the whole damn franchise lol"
"I mostly play multiplayer, not warzone, and it�s definitely worth it! No trouble finding games. Really good variety of game modes. Visually maps are stunning. And I liked the campaign as well. I love the way you can customise the guns and really fine tune your load out."
Still the best cod game on the market. I probably wouldn�t buy it unless you have mates to play with though.
What�s the 5th attachment you have on the gun?
No stock or my barrel? Recon barrel?
"Good job, but they do seem like bots."
I don�t know. Didn�t look like total bots to me. I think the guys pretty good and going against average players.
I mean...that�s the point of playing an objective mode...or did I miss something. I get why you play for kills but at least contribute towards the team by playing some of the objective lol
"I am contributing to the objective by killing everyone trying to get to it. I just want to know how those people dont get bored at all. It may be the point, but they�re like fuckin automatons. As soon as one point ends, they�re taking the shortest route to the next so they can sit in a corner and do nothing for another 45 seconds"
"I guess its because i hate loosing mostly, and on groundwar its always a battle to get to those objectives anyways, so i get my fill of gunfights aswell. I only play groundwar though so not sure how it is with smaller gamemodes"
Ah yeah groundwar is fine to play like that. The smaller modes are just...i dont see a point to it. They end a game with 10 kills and *maybe* a dinky little banner congratulating them on winning
"It's an objective based game mode so objective is the goal. The more time you spend actually focusing the objective means the sooner the game ends and the higher likelihood you win. In games like hardpoint I feel like I played badly if I don't get at least 2 mins on the point. 
   I honestly don't understand how people can enjoy playing objecting modes and only focus kills. If you get a lot of kills on objective it makes sense, but just running around the map and getting no objective time just to get kills doesn't make sense. 

Long story short, if you want kills play TDM, Kill confirmed or one of the other modes that focuses on getting kills."
Im not playing a gamemode with a kill cap.
[deleted]
Even if you sit on a point for 3 and a half minutes and get 5 kills to get it?
"My personal opinion on it, short and sweet, it�s a sense of accomplishment; more so if the team wins."
"I personally like some of the objective modes and play specifically what is intended.  If it�s domination, I�m capturing two points and keeping you from taking them.  It doesn�t mean I camp, nor that I have a low kill count.  Same thing with hard point.

I�m going to do what I can to hold that point for the 30 seconds it�s there, which means keeping you out.  I�m going to fight you to get to that point in the process and fight to get it back when taken from my team.

Those who say they�re doing their part by running around not playing the objective should go play death match instead.  It�s not helping the team, it�s helping your own stats."
"People play objective modes to play the objective and try to win the game by capturing/defending objectives

If you are playing these modes and not contributing then you�re just a bad team player"
Im contributin by killin everyone tryin to get to it.
"You can try find his kilo blueprint in armory. If it�s here, then you can buy this bundle"
"Had it pop up twice in the store, and it never saved in that section for some reason."
I have it in my store right now.
"Today I dodged an entire magazine, without returning fire, just teabagging when I could. Tried to establish an understanding I didn�t want to hurt him. Guy reloaded and killed me. Where are the cool COD players at :( we were an entire rooftop apart too"
When CoD players turned to religion and had enough of violence online.
Congratulations!

Make sure you dont have onedrive opened at the back (check bottom right corner for the icon). It was affecting a lot for me
this has been happening to me as well. 3080 and a 5800x
"Man i came here to vent about this too. I try to be fair and say maybe i just have a crappy connection, but 149 down and 160 up isn�t that bad right? 

I�ll get in a round and the minute an opponent and myself turn the corner on each other the screen starts jumping around like crazy, then it�s constant packet loss."
Actually facts. My match search would go all the way up too 200ms before they want to place me against another Canadian who isn�t as good in mw. it�s the most piss off thing ever funny part is it�s in Cold War too JUST LET ME PLAY AGAISNT CANADIANS WHY DO I HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST PEOPLE WITH THE ITALIAN AND MEXICAN FLAGS AS THEIR CALLING CARD JUST CAUSE THEYRE AS GOOD AS ME I WONT MATTER WHEN IM GETTING GATTED BY PEOPLE I CANT SEE IN BOTH GAMES
"It's more likely SBMM causing it than something being broken.  

As the population drops SBMM won't be able to find full lobbies of players with an equal skill level (or however it calculates it) so it has to get people who live further away and therefore higher pings. 

It also could be Activision reducing server locations which would also cause this."
This is great.
I saw that exact video on tiktok
Yeah haha that's my tiktok :)
Masterpiece

Song?
Song: Life Letters - Never get used to people
That was sick. Bump or whatever
this is cool as fuck
I bought cod points for the wrong cod and I�ve tried to get in touch W activision and it doesn�t work every time it either leaves me waiting for a support person or says they�re all taken it�s so annoying
I waited 1:30 minutes before deciding it's probably glitched. Bs covid excuse probably.
What do you mean with wrong cod? Don't they all share cod points?
"Happened to me maybe two months ago � money deducted, still haven�t got my points."
I bought $10k of cod points thinking I could use it to buy Bitcoin but it didn�t work but at least I have some cool calling cards now
I'm asking about people who haven't received the points they've purchased.
Gotta take it up with Sony my man.
"I've talked to Sony Support, it's an Activision issue but good luck trying to talk to them"
I�m on ps4 and I just restart it and problem fixed sorry to hear bout that man you�re not the only one tho so if activision don�t fix it mw is truly being left in the dust
Thanks for all the replies. Good to know it�s not a problem with my console.
I still don't get how did you manage to get the last kill?
Last ally was killed at the back of the office (look at the minimap) it means that enemy is also at the back of the office but from the other side
Enemy got close enough to the wall for their aimbot to lock onto them.
Always a free kill in Team defender
Holy shit what a shot lol
Plywood doesnt make great shelter from bullets
But apparently bushes and fences with vinyl and grates with holes block bullets wonderfully on warzone.
Impressive
"Thank you, I think this is the ""once in a life time"" moment in COD."
"Honestly, Idk If I would ever be able to do that in a match, I would just wait for him to come out. Impressive!"
If there was a playlist with no snipers or marksmans� I would play the hell out of it. I know I must be alone in this opinion but I feel the whole quick scope mechanic is totally broken.
No sniper ground war would fuckin rock
It's definitely not broken. I can understand it's annoying but you need actual skill to quick scope.
"Marksmans yes, snipers no. The AX50 is very hard to go crazy with compared to the Kar and SPR"
"I�d love a version of this game just tweaked ever so slightly... 

get rid of those melee sticks;
a bit more flinch, and less auto aim on snipes;
some kind of a suppression mechanic or something that makes LMGs a little dangerous;
and a touch more damage on sidearms, as it�s not too often worth switching to an x16 at the moment.

MW feels so close to perfect for me. There�s just those tiny few things that make it a bit infuriating."
It�s the lack of flinch for me
You are absolutely not alone
Absolutely agree. I get killed by more sniper/marksmen rifles than anything else.
"Nice. 2nd one was kinda lucky, but still props. Do you use fmj?"
"Yes, on all weapons :p"
I would have just reported you and called it a day.
He�s definitely going to report you
you can tell he's really going for that Damascus
Nothing compared to r/titanfall Kraber montages
That�s called luck not skill
"Since this post has gained so much traction in the form of ""quickscoping takes no skill yet I'd never be able to hit those shots"" and the people that are trying to cover up their jealousy of other people with skill by saying ""one-shot weapons"" are the problem how about we remove any chance of shotguns being able to one-shot?
You know the thing that can instakill without even aiming 90% of the time? 
Or is that not a problem?
Don't see any of the noobs sooking about that."
Quick scope is bullshit that should have been removed back on the 360 days. No skill ass bullshit
Show us a clip of yourself quick scoping everyone then?
"Okay while I do agree QS�ing can be really annoying, it definitely takes skill. 

Now my only argument to people that defend quickscoping is how it�s kind of hypocritical.
M4 consistently outguns SMG�s up close, op (justified)
MP5 consistently outguns AR�s+LMG�s at range, op (justified)
Snipers/Marksmen�s outgun SMG�s up close.... perfectly fine (not justified when comparing imo)"
What every guy without skill says LMFAO
"Lol, have you ever played any game ever? MW 1-3? Titanfall? CS? It�s literally a most valuable and hard-to-master skill for sniper rifles EVER, and if you�re loosing a shot, you�re dying most of the time, so quickscope is a risk you need to take.

And how do you want to remove it? Make a WoT accuracy mechanics?"
Quickscoping does take a bit of skill but they are extremely annoying to die to. The only thing worse is shotguns.
Whiners like this make me enjoy quick scoping even more. Thanks for the inspiration!
love people who think they are good when they use one shot weapons lmao
"Nah, more like people who think they are any good for using the spr. I mean you cannot go really intense with the sniper class. The Marksmen rifles are just annoying as hell."
"aimbot.

which one did you buy"
"Probably just your camo grind catching up from where you should have been credited earlier. I had many a game going for Damascus where I�d get one kill at the start, die, and then be credited for a 3 kill streak. This was in non spectating game modes like domination or tdm."
"I thought so too, but I did check before the match where I was at the camo progression and during the match before spectating I had 1 kill and was awarded 2 camos after I respawned. 

It could however be from a previous game catching up, but I doubt that. I will test it out further to check."
"It might be related to in some instances, spectating who killed you gets you XP."
I've not heard this but I'll try testing it out. Would be very good for riot shield camos lol
I don't think it would work for warzone because you always go down and pull out a pistol. So the pistol probably counts as the last active weapon in that case
"Is there a hidden pistol when you are downed? 

But if you are ik Solo, you die instantly unless you hve self revive. So just have for example the pellington als your active weapon and semtex your feet and die. You will automatically spectate someone after death regardless. 
I will test this out later tonight and will get back to you guys. My Iso smg has been u touched sinds it was added so I can test with that."
You could switch them in the ps4 accessibility menu button assignments
"Thanks but I tried that. It lets you switch & flip every button expect touchpad/options 

I think I'll just have to get use to using pause to view the main map. As I've gotten more used to the layouts of the maps I don't use the main map as much but it's nice to quickly view it in modes like domination"

That's what a PS4 has and it works...but it should be somewhat optimised in that version. You'll probably have to run it in pretty low res.
"I noticed a significant improvement moving up from 8GB on pc. Better fps, smoother play, less lag. I would not recommend playing on 8GB as enjoyable."
"It�s enough to work. The game will  function well enough although it won�t be performing nearly as good as it could be. 

The system & background applications is going to suck up 2gb or so, And MW will likely suck up around 5gb. 

Although given sufficient Ram, MW will use upwards of 10gb. 

Tip: Make sure you�ve got XMP enabled in your MoBo�s Bios"
"I have an old Gaming Laptop I used to use that had 8GBs of RAM and 3GBs of vRAM. It'll work. It won't be pretty, but it'll work. Obviously more vRAM will help too."
Mine has 4gb of vram
"As someone who used to have 8GB of RAM, yes it will. But you'll experience some stutters there and there. I highly recommend to add more RAM"
"Yeah, talk to your parents kiddo."
I�m happy my parents let me play
"My Activision name was Avant Garde, seems it's still the same on cold war but for some reason infinity ward flagged it no clue as to why. Would be great if they gave you a reason as to why they flagged your name, instead of just giving you a pop up. Would contact their support, but last time I needed to contact them about an issue they were less than helpful."
That explains why they announced they would be giving out free name change tokens this month. Lmao. Priorities.
"To everybody else you're ""anon12345"" yes.

If the name wasn't inappropriate they wouldn't have removed it. Just because you had it for a long time doesn't mean its safe. They change the rules all the time. You can get your name reset just for having a porn stars name or a name with a reference to politics. Nothing new tbh. People who post about name bans always swear their names weren't offensive or ban worthy, but they never say what their name used to be before the ban. Interesting."
"This is a tough one, I love slamming through doors and emptying my mag, the peak feature is cool but useless tho, also they are loud as shit in warzone"
"Yes they are, peak feature minimizes the sound though so if you got an extra 2 seconds, I would definitely use it to open the doors."
The peeking feature isn't that useless. It helps moving through rooms quietly and carefully.
"Actually the door is not at fault here. Claymore needs a slight delay until they actually blow up. I can understand the realism that tripping on a claymore is guaranteed fucked. But then I remember BF3 where I can actually get cracked and out manuever claymore, or crouch and not having to trip them at all. It reward player who push lanes and clear choke points carefully and punish those that run around like headless chickens. Perfectly balanced.

In MW, the only way to counter claymore is EOD, but then you still lose some health and people that run Sharpnel is gonna fuck you up with another clay. There is no way in hell to out manuever a claymore, the moment you see it, you are fucked. Especially annoying in HC. Doesn�t matter if you move out of it way, doesn�t matter that you slide pass it, doesn�t matter if you crouch or prone,...fucked anyway."
"I have the spotter perk on all of my classes. It let's you see them through walls, but also hack them so they become yours instead!"
I got used to them. I would be happy if they would keep the MW 2019 mechanics.
"I like them because they cut off lines of sight when maneuvering, making repositioning easier. But some people abuse it (shoot house office) to camp, which is why I feel like we should have the ability to RPG the doors to oblivion or shotgun the hinges and kick the door down (or other breaching mechanics)"
"Remove them for non objective modes. Problem solved.

They make modes like headquarters really good and add another layer. Modes like TDM however they are just annoying."
That's actually a change I can get behind
"Mine was hacked over 11 days ago, I was expecting get it back in a short time before reading your post.........."
Hopefully you have better luck because I can't believe a game of this magnitude could have such poor customer service
"Can't believe finding out two previously linked account could be so difficult~~
I got Damascus also and bought several bundles, anyway , Good Luck for both of us."
Good Luck.  Mine was hacked last July and support just gave me the runaround.  I'm involved in a class action lawsuit about it actually.

" Hi Call Of Duty, The Field Of View Will Come in Consoles?"
Winning gone sexual.
What's even more erotic for me is the fact that it was a 1v5 and he only used one mag.
turn down the brightness oh my god my eyes
"Brightness set to flashbang, still can't see fucking gimp suit roze"
I think it�s because they�re using a HDR tv/monitor. It probably looks fine through the screen but it can fuck up in recordings
Yeah seriously. The game looks so washed out and blinding.
"That�s the gamma setting, it is way too high for me."
Lol its not as bad on my screen just looks weird when I record
white phosphorus simulator
Gotta find those roze skins some how!
How are you supposed to see people camping in dark corners though?
I think he edited it with the windows photos editor. I do that too and it ALWAYS jacks the brightness up with no control over it
The P90 is good but I stopped using it because to get gold I need long range kills but I don�t have a good load out for it
I did it last week. I didn't find it more difficult than other SMG if you do shoothouse for that.
"Longshots for SMGs are basically melee range. Just play the game, you'll get it fast enough."
If you want good set ups then go to youtube. I find good ones on there and then change them to my preference
Along with other good suggestions here i usually play hardcore for long shots.  Nothing for infuriating than having someone finally go through a long shot choke point only to not hit them enough to kill.
Hardcore really helps
"Vlk 3x, long barrel, monolithic. Go to the wall in shoot house and set it to semi auto"
"The easiest way I�ve found to get long shot kills with the p90 was the vlk, long barrel, and mono suppressor. Then just run what ever other attachments you want."
I would have died at the reload immediately after the plant.
I would have probably ADS at the top of the stairs and died.
That moment you reloaded in the stairwell after planting the bomb is when I would have been shot from the window
"The moment he looked away from the window to run up the stairs and check the roof, is when I would�ve been shot from the window."
The way kill #4 just jumps in front of your bullet spray... lol nice
"Hahaha for real not really sure what he was doing, bro had a kar98 in his hand too lol"
What did they say at the end?
Lots of inaudible screaming about how im sweaty and not good at the game
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wish more of these videos saved the vc :/
You only see this type of thing with a 720 these days. Especially on this map. Good shit
Thank you
It's an absolute crime that platinum is the best looking camo in the game instead of Damascus
Lol not to people like me who are too lazy to grind launchers and melee ;)
I feel Damascus looks better
Good shit but the brightness
Nice streak man I�m sure the heart was pumpin after that one!
You already know!
"I always feel I do better with the P90 than its TTK indicates. I don't know why, or what about the P90 makes me play better with it than I should."
Do keep in mind this is hardcore. But yea the p90 shreds
Beautiful. That double kill with the guy jumping through the window was awesome luck.
"Seriously, sometimes the stars just line up in your favor lol"
"reminds me of that one time on csgo. i was saving up and my team was on an eco round, so decided to get a mac 10, levlar and one flashbang. the map was agency and my team rushed and immediately died. my heart was racing, it was a 1v5. my mac 10 fuckin saved me when they rushed in blindly. literally, when i heard all of their footsteps i threw a flashbang and sprayed and 3 of them were already dead. there were 2 people and it lasted a hell of a long time. i was camping like a lil bitch near the bushes next to t spawn. when there was 20 seconds left, they rushed in and didn't notice me, so i sprayed. i cant believe they were gold nova"
"the mac is actually underrated in csgo, it kills so fast"
"I never played cs given that Im a console player, but that game always looked so intense."
"In the intro all i could think about was how you didn't check for ninja defuse and then later you pre-fired the bomb.

Good play though."
Rely mostly on my headset for that
P90 is so slept on
Agreed
Hipfire ftw
The p90 really is underrated
Planting A on crash and not using a 725? You absolute lunatic.
Sometimes you gotta live on the edge
There�s maps on this game I don�t even remember exist just cause I haven�t gotten them in so long.
For real! Its always suldal harbor or petrov oil rig lol
Not using a 725 on the stairway?? Your a mad man!

"CSGO 1.0 in MW engine would be the value '3.33333'

Use https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/ to make sure all your games are consistent. It definitely helps me immediately feel comfortable in any game."
I wouldnt do 1:1 mw is much easier to aim with and requires more 180ing

"All war zone assets are tied to the MW game so you can�t have one without the other. Pretty BS IMO, COD should not take up 200+ GB for the scale of the game (GTA 5 is only 95gb).

Short answer: No you have to have WZ to play campaign"
"ablosute bs for real.

i mean i bought Modern warfare, not free Warzone with payed modern warfare update ffs"
Hard to compare a game from the ps3/xbox360 times with mw now.
Well the bocw guns are already modeled in mw engine but they are only available on Wz so im not surprised if any cosmetics re available too
"Do you actually see the charms? Cuz i got this glitch but it only worked with stickers. Charms are just invisible.

I really want a dorito on my amax"
"I think it's a bug on the code/glitch as well, we're not supposed to see them. I select my Dorito (which I'd love to get on every gun) but in Modern Warfare it stay selected, but completely invisible on the weapon, which is sad"
"They've been buggy for me, sometimes they don't even show  I have them for some reason"
"glitch, they're not meant to be avail.

sooner or later they'll fix it, for example https://i.imgur.com/e8RJjDD.png"

"They should have released season 7 of MW and kept CW separate from it. Putting seasons 1 and 2 of CW battle pass in MW was stupid, as none of the battle pass items can be used in MW..."
"Or at least if they dont want to make a s7 and just let the game die, then let it die. Don't change everything into a cold war ad and just fucking forget about the existence of mw"
">Putting seasons 1 and 2 of CW battle pass in MW was stupid, as none of the battle pass items can be used in MW...

Feel free to correct me, but I'm certain with the season 2 BP, new vehicle skins can be applied in MW now. They even mark the tiers as ""MW Exclusive""."
[deleted]
Yea and the battle pass is so fucking broken!! I don't get any of the cod points at all!! The entire game is just a big mess. Last COD game I ever wasted my money on.
Then they wouldn't have drip content for later on
"It all comes down to BOCW sales. They launched and it didn�t hold up to their expectations. The money was already spent so they couldn�t let their new game die. Slowly kill the old one and try to rake in as much cash from the store for ops and blueprints as they can. The franchise holds such a huge place in the gaming community they know that they can do whatever they want and still make money.

They don�t care about anything that is said about the terrible integration/take over as long as the dough keeps rollin in. If they did, the communication from activision, IW, treyarch, raven or whoever would be much greater than some trello board. They don�t even put patch notes in game anymore. Another sign of how they don�t care.

This will continue even when the new MW rolls out. The cycle repeats. Activision = Quantity not Quality."
"Sadly the last phrase is a big tl;dr. 

Yet, i don't know if it was about money. If you think about it. Warzone generated more profits than mw and cw together, so I don't know why they would run out of money with that piggy bank getting thicker and thicker"
"What, you *don�t* like a game being forced down your throat in the game you�re playing?

/s


Atleast in the older CODs, they�ll still advertise it, but only in like notes and shit.


Imagine if WW2 turned into Whatever game came after that.


Hell, I�m losing hope we�ll ever get those 3 guns. They�re in the game and even usable, but for WZ only.

I�d shoot bail if they didn�t have challenges that can be found in the game."
"I mean we really need to get used to it at this point,if they�re keeping this integration,WWII (or whatever Sledgehammer is making) will be shoved down in CW and MW�s players� throats,and every COD game after that

and all the conspiracies will rise from both sides about how Activision is trying to push the new COD game,it�s basically gonna become like the good ol COD cycle,just with a little flavor 

Maybe MW wouldn�t get permanent StS,maybe CW will have missing content that should�ve been there but never made it because of the new COD,who knows"
I just want to play the campaign and I'm forced to download warzone on pc if I want to play the single player aspect. What a waste of HD space.
I play on ps4 and it's worse on console
"I quit the whole COD games and try to avoid them as the rest of my life after they abandoned MW2019. 

And I still happy as never before with that decision. 

They should learn how to respect the massive players that support MW2019."
"I mean I only like it because I can work toward my battle pass while cycling between both games, but I don�t speak fo the majority at all lmao. I bought MW during season 1 of CW lol."
"Warzone=/= MW multiplayer.
Warzone has access to all new guns."
"Not exactly. If they did a ""All new warzone season 1"" making warzone a different download, and adding the cx-9, sykov and RAAL exclusively for warzone I wouldn't complain. The fact that they added 2/3 unreleased guns as floor loot is just weird as hell for me. You can pick 'em up and level up, but you can't go to the gunsmith and make a custom class. 

Again, if they did warzone a separate game I wouldn't be mad even if they let mw2019 die, but what triggers me is the weird fusion of games and how they're using mw as a 60$ ad for the newest COD"
"Everyone seems to be getting mad at the integration, and I will give it to IW, treyarch and activision, I like the cross progression. I play both MW and CW, and being able to play modern warfare to unlock stuff for cold war is really beneficial to me, because I'm still grinding for Damascus (550 camos left), and this means my progression in cold war isn't hindered as much, I still get prestige keys and the battle pass cosmetics (the sas stone skin at like tier 30 looks amazing) but I don't have to play cold war for them, which is great. However, I feel like what happened with fortnite is happening again. The main game got an add on battle royale that became very popular and is now suppressing the main game and almost disregarding its playerbase.

I would love to see all the possible new guns in mw, (hopefully they're not as broken as the as val, but that pistol is definitley gonna be) and the soap operator"
"Yeah, you're right. There's a lot of people like you that bought both mw and cw, and they most probably don't care/are happy with the possibility of level up your cw account by playing mw, but overall this game is suffering a fortnite disease. At this point both mw and cw are becoming warzone add-on's"
BOCW BAD MW GOOD UPVOTE
"After not playing MW for a few months, I finally came back and it really does feel like Activision is trying to force CW down our throats."
[deleted]
"Get Tarkov, although MW19 is fun, I would not pay full price for it right now. Pick it up when it goes on sale"
I still have a blast on multiplayer. But if your not gonna play MW Multiplayer you should def buy Tarkov
I would play multiplayer
"Neither. Save your money for this year's next COD release imo. Current MW2019 isn't going to get any more major updates. And tonke tarkov is just okay, nothing special. But that's just my 2 cents."
I own and play tarkov a lot and I don't care about new content it's the fact that I want a good Multiplayer experience not like CW's super slippery feeling pvp
They come back just be patient. Don�t have a picture but the day they went out of the shop i was wondering if they would come back so i checked if they were in the armory and they were. I�ve also seen them in shop multiple times since then.
The SAW and Leather-face specifically in the shop? I know that the Ghost grim reaper and Dr Karlov come back regularly
"Look for the blueprint included in the pack and search the armoury for it, you might get lucky and find it"
Have you tried going into the armory to see if the weapons related to the bundles are there? Maybe you can buy from there
Tried and no luck
Install Call of Duty app. In this app it shows me in the store Ghost haloween skin
"I got it, its not there"
I hope not.
They will probably never return since they were licensed. Last I heard they where last available in December
Wrong they come back
same thing happened to me when i was trying to play gunfight with my sister on ps4
Splitscreen is broken since 4th february update. No fix atm. Tbh im so fed up with waiting that im buying another ps4 to be able to play with my gf

"I'm also currently having major issues with support. No response from an email ticket. The only responses i've gotten from repeated submissions to the account recovery form is that my issue is not relevant and they link me to useless support articles. basically been trying to kick up a storm contacting them in as many ways to get my account back. Most recently i've been linked to the live chat, which is always down even within the chat hours listed.

Its honestly insane how little support staff they have, and how little they can do. Especially when its blatantly obvious that I own the account, have tons of proof, and its blatantly obvious that someone hijacked it."
"Fully agreed, and the live chat has been a nightmare. What baffles me most is the inability for support staff to interact with the process of account recovery. I've been told multiple times that they can't do anything and the only ones that can are the ""account recovery specialists"" or something along those lines."
Always been this way.
Has it gotten worse since the latest patch? I used to be able to compete with my ar�s in hardcore.  Now I am just getting slaughtered
"Gum's gotten mintier lately, have you noticed?"
Lol
SMGs are Overpowerd since release
I wonder why they never nerf them. I see a lot of folks complain about them.
"I know I'm 2 days late, but man they should nerf all the SMG's in this game. They literally make ARs pointless. Unless you're playing groundwar."
"Me too bud. At least the KILO is still pretty decent. I have to main the kilo now because my M13 is useless if I am in a lobby full of SMG�s, which I always am lol"
In HC smgs can one shot in that first range while most AR 2 shot. Gun balancing is kinda out the window in HC it�s whoever can shoot first and smgs just have better mobility.
Well imo balancing isn�t so great in core either. Just run an SMG and hop around amd you�ll wreck every server you�re in. I run the M13 and I lose every gunfight vs an smg in core. So idk maybe balance is just kinda bleh
Most of the competitive scene switches to the new cod and this game doesn�t really have competitive outside of game battles.
Makes sense. I have Cold War so do you recommend I just practice on there instead?
Start in GameBattles
Sounds good
Do I need a team for game battles or can I go in soli
Aim lab is good for reflex training.
"Legs, back, chest & tris up your protein add in some cardio then your golden camo should unlock"
Bet should I bulk or just lean out
By solid clan I don�t mean faze lmao I just mean other likeminded players than I can grow with and they�ll call me out when I screw up and whatnot
One other question as well in regards to the future of competitive gaming should I be practicing on Cold War or is the majority of the player base still on Modern Warfare like I think it is?
"I mean you can play either but the only competitive scene for modern warfare is Warzone really. For multiplayer, definitely Cold War."
have you played cod before? they make a new game every year and typically leave the last game in its dust
"Yeah I have but theirs always a large group of people that don�t like the next game and stick around for another year, it�s not like it�ll take long or it�ll be hard."
Money
Check back next week.  Also GF tourneys every Friday for the past 3 weeks.
"I heard like on the 11th the new guns might drop but idk, the date has changed like 3 times"
just get the next BF. they let their games breathe for a couple years
[deleted]
When is it gonna be set?
"Honestly makes me sad, such an enjoyable game & it's just gonna turn to shit."
100%
"They updated the game all of 2020, as they do every year with COD. The games have a yearly life cycle. Once the next one comes out around October, they drop support around December. They like money and I guess put all of their efforts towards CW updates and the next COD coming out. I know people like MW but this isn't a new thing. Just cross your fingers and hope that the next one is better."
They milked this cow already
Because Cold War is out and Infinity Ward is working on the next thing.
"IW is no longer in charge of MW. Raven is. 

Their last game (Infinite Warfare) they kept alive with updates for years. 

The reason they can�t do that here is because Modern Warfare is the base application for Warzone. Warzone is designed to be a constant for years to come according to the Activision CEO. So they�re going to have a dedicated team work on it (Raven) going forward. 

IW should have free reign over their next title since it wouldn�t come with Warzone attached."
Ok
R u talking about gunfight or face off? Cuz everyone gets the same load out each round in gunfight so there�s really no �snipers only rule�. Just use what u want to win the game
"https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/ly22pz/unwritten_rules_of_gunfight/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Read it. Literally just this morning. The sniper thing was just an example, or a post filler really."
Holy shit go outside
Lmao spoken like a true cod community member. Thank you for this
"Lol, talking about 'no place for casual' and immediately switching to ' abusing the 725 if possible'.   Don't you contradict yourself by saying this? How do you even decide when to switch to 725 in the first place? Is it when you are annihilated by an actually good player who knows his guns? Then you are the casual one, if you have to abuse cheese strategies in order to win."
Yeah fuck snipers if you wanna quickbum each other private match it
"I think we found the guy with the riot shield, 725 and claymores."
"Bro quick play is filled with this mind set too, camp in a corner some more I�m sure you�ll improve

I be playing games to have fun and relax, not to stress like in a cdl game."
"Then don�t get mad when you opted for sniper rifle in a pistol fight. I�m not directing this to you, just the twats who enforce rules on other, get mad when no one follow and see it as indecency. Looks, have fun the way you want, sweating out and out-performing my enemies in GunFight is my fun. I�d be hypocritical to criticize your fun, but I didn�t. Have fun and let other have them too regardless of how they do it."
Imagine trying to play casually on a competitive FPS. Completely ass backwards. Like trying to be super sweaty in an Among Us lobby. Who does that?
"You get good, practice quickscoping. That is the only way. And please get rid of the �as fast as possible� and �I don�t want to waste time� mindset. No pain no gain as you will waste your time, no getting away from that. There is no shortcut to Sniper Rifle, practice practice and practice."
I can attest to this. I had the same mindset and HATED snipers with a passion (specifically quickscoping) because I couldn�t do it. Last year at the beginning of quarantine I decided to teach myself and now it�s my favorite thing to do. You�re only as bad as you let yourself be.

Definitely won your team the round. Fucking roof campers on hackney search.
"Yea, I didn�t even realise it was a collateral at first I was just happy with the no scope"
Holy shit nice shot bro
respect snipers
u are insane
You can't be upset if someone doesn't follow your imaginary rules. Its their game too
"Well, I can be, but I can't enforce it. There not really my rules, they are rules that I have gotten from other people that play the game at a high level than me. But I understand your logic and I respect it."
"Yeah, these rules are stupid. If I see them, I kill them however I can/want."
Okay
"Usually people pay 60 dollars to tell the hooker what to do, takes a special kind of Hooker to tell you what to do instead. Fucking clown."

"There is only one rule: Win. If you don�t follow that rule, you�ll lose."
Okay
What kinda fun killing rules are these?
Rules I've learned from people that want to have fun
[deleted]
They could just create a separate version of the game mode. Ground war no snipers/kill streaks.
"lol this is the main reason why i dont bother with ground war at all. The snipers in roofs and windows ruins it for me. i wanna run around like a headless chicken, not play like a camping pussy."
"They can�t do much on certain maps. That�s why I only play Promenade, Airport, and Port for the most part. Avoid that farm one like the plague and occasionally play the City one. 

Idk why they make snipers only playlists when they should make one without. A lot of their ground war gameplay trailers are fake as hell because nobody would do what they�re doing with all the campers sitting on buildings or the edge of the map. 

But that said the aforementioned maps above I never have any problems with them due to the amount of coverage and line of sight you get. Can�t remember the last time I died to a sniper."
"Even when sniping, it�s so much more fun to run around and quickscope. I�m not sure why anyone enjoys camping a roof top."
"You completely lost me at ""It has the potential to do battlefield better than battlefield"""
Have you played battlefield 5?  Complete dog game.  Been out for a over 2 years and it still feels like an alpha and the maps were designed by someone who has their memory wiped every 8 seconds.
"Seriously, how am I supposed to kill people when there's white phosphorus everywhere and gunships that kill you the second you go outside?

Be nice to have a mode where there's no killstreaks."
After all my time playing ground war I think the only kill streak that doesn�t fit is white phosphorus. It just stops any progress in the game.
"""potential to do battlefield better than battlefield"""
"I wonder why they didn�t just copy BF�s conquest formulas. Conquest is literally perfect, a favorite game mode that was born even before the first CoD was out. Pretty sure it�s not owns by DICE. GW looks like a toodler standing up to a grown adult that is CQ."
Have you played battlefield?  Are you seriously going to try to see it's a good game?
Still not as bad as Cold War
"Each game has their own problems, I just prefer to play modern warfare. 

Kill streaks should probably need a larger amount of kills so they�re harder to obtain. I like the sniper idea but then it�s kind of unfair towards the snipers. I do hate how they just sit in spawn and just snipe you do as soon as you�re anywhere in the open and I would rather not have to do the same to get kills."
"Are you they guy who spams the weird crossbow clips while hiding in the bushes?
And no hate, but who requested this?"
Yes I am ! And different people off and on Reddit.
"I mean... you got hacked. obviously. they unattached your xbox account from activision and changed your email in activision.

open a ticket and good luck."
You got hacked my dude.
I don�t know what the hype is about.. All I�m getting is fire shotguns and spawn campers. Bring back shoot the ship it�s much better.
like there are no campers and fire ahotguns on STS
"I just thought shipment was cool because it was so fast paced with many kills. I don't care about skins or achievements, but I do prefer a match where I can get 60 kills instead of a map that is big and searching for enemies takes up most of the time.

I don't camp, I don't snipe and really hate both of them. So running around creating mayhem is just fun, shipment is the only map that provides such intense gameplay, and that is for me the most attractive part."
Same for me
"Bruh, it's like they fused shoothouse with shipment, on a 4v4. It's not a bad mode, BUT."
"It�s alright but it�d be better if it wasn�t 4v4, also the spawns are worse than shipment"
"If it was 6v6 I wouldn�t care but 4v4 is too little people. It doesn�t add enough chaos to where people need to be aware of everything. They�ll just sit in a corner or on the second floor and wait for people. 

Plus idk what it is about 4v4 but people in that setting just act like they�re playing a tournament and want to talk shit after every match because they grabbed 2 more tags than the team not even playing objective"
"Livestock is great, it�s basically shipment combined with shoot house"
You saved my Modern Warfare experience thank you
"i've unlocked everything except for damascus. i don't use launchers enough to bother unlocking it. plus it's 4v4 unlike the usual 5v5 or 6v6 and moshpit, which means the majority of my games will be kill confirmed and headquarters since everyone will be surfing lobbies to find a better game mode. and probably i'll encountered the enemy team camping in the back with their kar98s, sprs or doof doofs. because it is what it is, a huge barn in the middle and bottlenecks for both sides of the lanes. whereas shipment is mindless rng kill or be killed where you'll scrapped for points or get rolled by a superior enemy team. so excuse me for not liking livestock level design and that some of the better maps are gunfight mode exclusives."
There is no hardcore livestock.
Uninstalled as soon as I saw shoot the ship was gone. So fucking dumb that they don�t have it as a permanent mode like past cod games
When will shoot the ship return?
"Paid 60$ to do this, 60$."
Just a Ddos attack. Its not hacking or anything. There are programs out there that pull your ip address. Once they have that they can use a booter(There are plenty of websites for this) to send packets of useless information to your router which floods your internet and tanks your speed. You can hide your ip address with a VPN.
I recommend a VPN.
But will it increase the Ping?
This is crazy!!! I wanna find out if anyone has an answer to this. This would make an awesome �super tech support� on Reply All.
"Yea I wanna see what Activision and Blizzard are gonna tell me to do, I sent them both customer support tickets but I doubt they are gonna be helpful"
"> What this and how is it accomplished?

DDoS attack, random guy knew your IP address, still a hack, but nothing crazy, actually pretty normal.

> Should I be concerned about this person potentially having access to my information?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: No, but you never know, just keep your antivirus updated and don't do stupid shit on the internet.

> How can I prevent this in the future?

* Use a VPN
* Reset your router so you get a new IP address (not guaranteed but may work depending on your ISP)
* Search your router for DDoS prevention."
how tf does a random guy get your ip? MW is p2p?
You could assign a static IP address to your PC so if a DDos attack occurs again you can change it again.
"He can get your IP through means of hacking or programs that operate through xbox/playstation/PC parties and take your IP that way. They then use websites or programs to do a DNS attack with your IP and take down your internet for some amount of time. The amount of time depends on their capabilities or how they're feeling that day. For this reason, you should never join random parties and never let anybody join yours. Nobody is safe in a public chat."
Do I have any way of protecting myself from this?
 Good donut
"He most likely got it through the lobby they were in the Xbox party scrambles your IP making things like free boots useless so either this guy had his own developed program and knew what he was doing or he got it through the game lobby they were in, either way he's scum"
"Looks like he�s done a DDoS on you. Which is illegal.

First phone your ISP (Internet Service Provider), tell them what has happened and request a new IP address. 

If you are going to report this to the police speak to your ISP about it while you request an IP address. They will advise you.


Once you have a new IP address look into getting a VPN if you are still worried."
"Do note that you don't need to call your ISP for a new IP. 

You can roll your IP by simply unplugging your router and modem for about 3-5 minutes. The ISP's IP pool will recycle the old IP and rotate, which will assign you a new public IP. I will note that if you do this a bunch (say, 12 times in a month), you may retain the IP through a restart. 

If that doesn't happen, then your ISP is using static IPs. I cannot think of a single ISP that does this as it's really stupid to do so.

Another note, I would not advise taking the time to notify your ISP or local police if you get DDoSd. This is simply because it is nearly impossible for them to track said person, so it's more of a waste of time. On top of this, it's incredibly difficult to confirm the culprit (most DDoSers use a VPN) and it's incredibly expensive to pursue legal action. The ISP will just ignore your request unless you're a business.

 NOW, if you are getting harrassed over and over again by the same person, then you might want to look into blocking that person and a VPN. Otherwise, it's a bit unecessary."

Run a comp instead of SoH if needed. Just have a mental note that the gun shoots left up early and that the bullets are going below and left of the irons instead of dead on the irons."

"Hoooo buddy! Start with a monolithic supresor. I mean. Always run that shit anyway. Its OP. Then go with the XRK zodiac barrel, comando foregrip, 45 round mag and stippled wrap. This class is insane

Alternatively if you want a more agile build for close range action go with no stock instead of the grip. More ads less control. All of the good amax!"
Thank you
"Biggest barrel
No stock
Tac laser
Operator foregrip
Sleight of hand."

This is the best class set up for the Amax and decreases nothing. This is it."

"Monolithic suppressor, XRK Zodiac S440, Merc Foregrip, Stippled Grip and FFS CQ Stock or CR-56 EXO."

I was wondering why Adler was speaking in mw ear lol.
"*We have a job to do, Bell*"
Waaaaaaaaat?!?!!!
This game is broken.
"It is my understanding Raven is doing the updates now, so it�s very possible they incidentally introduced the codes for Cold War voices on the Modern Warfare platform.  With that said, it�s a recent bug that apparently pops up when using random as your operator."
It would make sense for that to happen since Infinity Ward is doing MW 2021 or whatever and since Raven is the head of Warzone if I recall and they both run on the same engine they would have shared files. So warzone as most things active and MW has only MW items Enabled and I guess by my understanding is that they forgot to disable the Cold War Operators Voice Lines.
That last guy actually peeked a second time in the same position. Well done mate. The lobby chat must have been brilliant!
its just a game
I just wanna play a different game besides Minecraft
"You sure you haven't accidentally hit one of the F keys? F9-F11, one of them mutes all sound. There is also the possibility that COD is defaulting to a different sound adapter too."
"I thought it was the F10 key as well but then I remembered I have that unbound in MW/Warzone and it wouldn�t explain BOCW being silent too. 

Checked the in-game sound outputs and changing them makes no difference. My HDMI receiver that I use for those sessions where I want big speaker output rather than a headset is not even registering that anything is being output while those three games are running."
If your looking for things like the balkan blue pack you can still find it under its m4a1 blueprint in the armory and buy the pack from that as well as his fsb kit from the ak47 blueprint
"Thanks, yeah I've seen Balkan, FSB, Polish guy, and Frogman"
"They're already making some available. Have you not seen or heard of vault packs? Just give it time, we'll get more."
It�s pretty unlikely we get anything Other than season 1. These have been in the files since season 4 and no other season was mentioned.

As someone who has all of them: F that entire mentality.
"u literally browse reddit all day to comment on shit like this, Ur so sad lmao"
boots on the ground war should be in the game at all times
Since warzone is tied to it I don�t see that happneing
It is so overwhelming lmaooo

How did you get the flame throwing knife
"Krueger's ""Firestarter"" bundle ! The first I ever bought haha"
Dude I�ve been dealing with this. Restarting the Xbox with the disc inside worked for me.
"I�ll try that again, did you normal reset or hard reset"
Do you have the free version of warzone installed? If you do then you need to uninstall it and then put the disc in and it will install multiplayer and warzone.
Oh jeez that sounds like a pain but I�ll try that. How can you tell difference between free and paid version of Warzone
Even though multiplayer is already installed on it

I felt rage radiating off of you
I�ve done this but with a Javelin before and it was HC so like 2 of my mates died
They should have given the AUG like a 36 or more-round mag. Cause that shit depletes ammo fast. I know there's the 60-round 5.56 NATO mag but I don't want to sacrifice mobility for it.
wait is rust 24/7 in the rotation??
They cba to optimise the game to do that. Game's going to stop getting updated after a few more months anyways.
What�s cba?
Has nothing to do with optimization. And this game is going to be updated for years to come as it�s the home application for Warzone. Unless the rumors that they�re porting it over to a stand-alone game with the Cold War engine is true.
Playing split screen (on a PS4) gets you a better FOV. It makes it hard to go back to single player because it feels like everything is being viewed with horse blinders on.
"I remember from older cods playing split screen, it reduced your sensitivity. But now I am wondering was that sens reduce feel due to higher fov. Not sure."
"Well Cold War for console has an FOV slider, so at least we know we'll be getting it for future CODs. Sadly I doubt we'll be seeing any more major updates to the game besides warzone and the stuff already in the game files like the guns. They're just too busy working on the next game coming out this year. Let's just hope this next COD is better than CW."
"The multiplayer is definitely worse then MW but Outbreak/Zombies in general is better then anything in MW.

Only thing that kept me from playing STS"

"Could be connection, i came on to ask if anyone from the midwest US was having issues. When i do a ping test on my pc i used to hit chicago at 10ms but I can�t get a ping on chicago only toronto at 23-25ms and when i tried to find a game last night same thing happened to me it was weird."
"Watch ping when matching. If it goes to 350 within 1 min you are.
If it stays under 250 (I think) you are just having trouble"
"Yeah, it spikes to 350 and then I�m in an empty match without anyone. I haven�t done anything wrong with my account, why would I be banned?"
I would like to help

Every one has their moments where we can�t hit shit
My friends constantly say aim assist barely does anything and it barely exists. After seeing this I cannot believe them ever again.
"I love it and it�s still pretty quick matchmaking for the most part.

The game holding up is questionable lately though. Each update breaks something it seems."
"To be fair, each update has broken something since launch."
Yes one of the best cod�s in a while IMO.
"This is my first COD game I've bought. I got it a month ago and I'm hooked. Map selection is kinda ass for the most part, but mobility and gunplay feels amazing in this game. Hell, I'm going for the Damascus camo right now!

If you can, it would be best to try and find a discount, but other than that, and occasional bugs, I would recommend this game, ESPECIALLY over Cold War (imo)."
If your first game is mw 2019 then you can�t judge shit for Cold War considering you haven�t even played a fast paced cod
"Not a BR guy either, but they have another mode in warzone, ""plunder"" its about how much money you can get, respawns/loadout etc - unlike BR, which I never play.   Plunder is where its at, give it a try, its free :)

Best code since BO2
It's not worth full price
"Over a year after release and with all the content that's been added, I'd say yes especially if it goes on sale."
"The best shooter game release for last gen consoles, ik ppl still playing bo3,bo4 and ww2 they have quick lobby and thoese games without crossplay

MW cross play and u cant buy it and play it for the next 2 years (until next iw title release)"
"Honestly, if they dropped the price on battle.net to $40, I'd get it in an instant"
Still fun but lots of campers
"Shoothouse: love the map. 
Shipment: great for camos."
i'm grinding camos and having fun (when not mounted :)
"i just want shipment 24/7 cuz it�s insane and chaotic on TOP of being great for camos. couldn�t care less about shoothouse, i personally hate that map."
Livestock is goated
I bet the devs regret the day shipment was added. Makes all other maps worse compared to it
"If you're switching to pc youll just have to log in with your activison account. So whatever email is asscoiated with your activsion, and your activsion password. It has nothing to do with your sony account, they aren't linked together"
But would there be any way for them to identify who I am from my sony account that you know of?
"Nice, the mounted kills are so frustrating when grinding"
"They are a major pain in the test, especially the M13 and Gray. Super low damage at long range when most people are using an LMG or sniper to get mounted kills. I have another clip where i got a quad feed with the Akimbo Renetti that has a moment where i almost broke my controller because of how weak the M13 is."

Wtf
This is your reminder that you can put the ChainSAW stock and a sniper scope on the FiNN LMG and it'll let you hold your breath when you tighten your hip fire spread.
AHAHAHA now that�s sweaty memelord style. I�m going to try it.
.
I feel like thats a bug
lol
Hehe no stock makes gun ugly hehe
I love the gunsmith. Making idiotic looking classes and then using them is some of the most fun I�ve had in a while.
"Try a No stock + longest barrel + biggest mag + sniper scope FAL


PAIN"
Oh you need the Odin with the longest barrel and that huge suppressor on that bad boy haha
That actually performs well. These DONT
It's the Pringle gun
Hanging massive dong that oden
It's the best thing about the gunsmith because you can take any gun and adapt it to your playstyle. I have to agree that some of that stuff dosen't make sense tho hahahaha
Yes because we did that 1.5 years ago lol
that magnum is an accurate representation of what someone who sweats plunder uses
"Its not good lmfao, the muzzle makes it nigh inaccurate"
Because everyone figured it out and posted them last year.

Stop leaving games....
That only happens in cw. Modern warfare has no leaving penalty
[deleted]
Has NOTHING to do with leaving games.
On the ps4 its already 60fps...
"Considering my base model ps4 runs it at 60fps, yeah for sure."
"oh ok I didn't even know, that's cool"
"Yeah but I noticed last gen on larger maps and Warzone would have drops into the high 40s/low 50s at times, mainly in the downtown area of Verdansk. PS5 is pretty much locked 60."
For me is the same buddie

"MW is still supported with support and patches/bug fixes yes. But major updates that implement new systems that weren't in MW or Warzone to begin with? You have too much faith in them. They can't even release content or updates without breaking their game. And they've been dead silent about community issues like co-op, store glitches, FPS issues plaguing PC, account security and hacking, loss of COD points, etc. I have no faith in them to do anything more with MW besides break it. Activision has them too focused on CW and the next COD coming this year."
It wont be sadly
There is probably FPS issues on the first gen consoles with it cranked. On xbox one is struggle to maintain 60fps on the low fov it has atm. Would be nice if you guys could lower the graphics slightly to bump the FOV and not have poor FPS though.
"I am unsure what the performance issue would be. I did a quick test using fov 60, 100 and 120 on a smaller map. The difference while running around etc is about 5-10 fps (on my PC). [https://postimg.cc/67FYMgpB](https://postimg.cc/67FYMgpB). Unsure what the effects would be on the large maps from WZ.

Considering the last generation consoles have AMD x86-64 cpu's and games such as CW, BF5 and others have a FOV setting (yes they are ""older"" engines), I think could be a lack of IW wanting to add it more than performance issues.

After all IW never added a FOV setting to the PC version of MW2 back in the day."
">The difference while running around etc is about 5-10 fps (on my PC).

thats a big difference if they're trying to maintain locked 60 FPS (or 120 on newer consoles) at all times.  consoles dont support VRR."
Or you playing against idiots
"For real , who the fuck falls for decoys"
How is the crossbow broken?
Because of the low whisper from the bolt being masked by the decoys you can shoot as many arrows as u want and never be seen
No the other team is just terrible. Your name still appears. And decoys have an obvious sound pattern. I always look in the opposite direction of the repetitive gun sounds. If anything shadows are more broken with dark outfits.
"Something I wanna point out with my decoys. They serve 2 purposes. 1 is to get the attention of enemies yes , but the 2nd is because since they are so loud for the enemy team they mask the sound of my arrows."
Proof that communication is king and enemy team is not communicating
And why you layin on your pussy playin like this ?
U really triggered that I laid down and smacked 4 people huh
Imagine how broken you�d think it was if you could land more of your shots��..  Crossbow is not broken at all buddy.
I think I missed like 2 arrows ?
"Alligance milsim, don�t think it�s sold currently"
"It�s live in the store, no need to click through the armory either. Thanks btw, just bought it"
You can still get it by looking at the blueprint for the m4a1 in armory.
"He could have been an experienced player, except that basing on his movement he looks like he's pretty clueless. 

I'd say he's pretty suspicious"
"He�s actually a really skilled player and he does this kind of thing all the time, but this was the most outrageous"
He just looked through the crack. Already knew the guy was in that general area since he killed you there
"I ended up getting the Aug gold, the rpg gold, and 2 pistols max ready to start on gold yesterday. I'm quite annoyed how they keep removing shoot the ship, I'd be fine playing the normal multi ONCE I have Damascus (speaking of which, tell me your progress before you got interrupted by the playlist change, I'm curious!)"
"For me getting it gold was pretty easy, just go into hardcore and you'll one shot everyone. If you have Issues with Movement Speed or ADS look for Lasers, The Stippled Grip Tape and the FTAC XL Elite Comb."
"I would recommend using the oden like a single shot marksman rifle on hardcore. If you�re accurate with it it can shred, you just have to get used to the god awful speed"
Just build it like an smg and run around like a headless chicken. It's actually not that bad if you get used to it.
"The problem is the recoil, should I run it like a smg in hardcore and just one tap?"
"Like they said, go hard core, and set it up for range and accuracy. Any shot is pretty much a kill, so fire rate isn't as important."
play hc. oden works great on shoothouse- get longshot and mounted kills by placing and mounting an edge of deployable cover.
Sucks they removed shoot the ship
Hardcore with thermal my man. Got that ish easy.
"OI! Don't you talk shit on the Oden, that things great. RDS, commando grip, slight of hand and then one of the barrels (idr which I use) with one of the items to let you ads faster and that thing slaps. 

I use it with a 25 round mag without the barrel sometimes too."
hc
Im gonna sit in the corner and wait for him to run past me. 9000 iq never before seen play
"The difference is it was a totally baited move. He knew I was behind him, I outplayed him. Grumpy gills, imagine being happy ever? Sheesh"
Pretty sure that�s just by default. Idk if you can turn it on.
I was just wondering because in all other CoD Campaigns I played I had one
"I prefer not having hit markers in the campaign, it really takes me out of the experience. I like not knowing if I didn�t shot the enemy enough it just adds more to the tension."
I know its not realted to this question but does anyone know when tamagutchi bundle is expected to ratate back in to store? And how often they change rotations of the store?
"Make a post, it'll get more traction"
Basically I chose random for all my operator skins then chose random for my operator and this hapoens
"Yeah I also have a clip of hearing Adler in a game of rust, weird as hell. Honestly it shows they're 100% functional in multiplayer, kinda stupid they made them unusable."
"Choosing Random is the reason why this bug happens. Due to Warzone integration, the game picks a CW operator to use, but since you can't have CW operators, it overrides the model with an MW operator, but it doesn't replace the voice. The overriding of models is also why you can have a skin equipped that you don't own as well."
It�s a visual glitch what emblem you have in game. You are not prestige at all and in military ranks. You�re unlocking things for cold war that you can use in warzone. After 55 you go back to level one and you�ll be prestige one. This is always where you�ll be now and every 50 levels will get you a prestige but you don�t reset level. Whenever a new season starts you go to level 1 but don�t lose the prestige level.
Okay thanks for the answer
"They released them in different regions.
Evidently the rainbow tracer pack and the ronin pack have been released in other regions of the world already.

As well as the previous season vault packs"
"I don't think he bought them. You can actually use those bundles earlier, but of course it's unauthorized and basically stealing. Check [this guy's channel](https://youtube.com/c/ElvisCOD) to see those bundles. 

For context, In Saudi's lobbies, you end up with cheaters basically everyday on S&D. Many of which run those unreleased bundles, and all of them are on PC. So yeah, I don't think it was ever released (unlike Tac Gas, the Singularity, and Roze's) 

Also, the one in OP's video is 100% on PC."
WinnR YT seems like a bitch.
Well the real question is if you were born a scum bag or if it developed over time. Sorry what I'm trying to say is why do you have to cheat to win like that?
"Infected was never about the win, it was about the fun."
They nerfed the corner building in Hackney Yard?
Well I didn't know that. I just thought the turtles were getting smarter :D
"The ""turtles"" still have to be mindful of its effects or they may interfere with it and break the lock. Letting go of the aim stick and moving forward keeps the lock on them unless they sprint away."
We are proving Darwin�s theory of evolution.
Nice! But for some reason that reticle bothers me lol
"Yea I thought i had to use that reticle to unlock others for the longest, then I actually read the challenge LMFAO"
Anytime I buy a bundle it brings me to a confirmation screen.
Yeah I�ve accidentally bought like 10 battlepass tiers after spamming �Skip celebration�
"User error bro, tough deal but ya gotta move on.

Simliar thing happened to me, wanted to click on season 2 to preview rewards, nope it just buys it out right. I dont even play enough to bother with season."
"the purpose of confirming the purchase is in case of user error, but these snakes know this and will not patch a confirmation in"
I can't take a post seriously that compares Activision pushing CW to racism.
Only way they would listen is if people don�t play.
That's exactly what daddy Activision wants.People to get off MW and onto BOCW.Only way they would actually liste is if people don't pay.
"Yeah the battle pass for a different game apart from certain cosmetics etc is stupid. 

And ultimately it�s what made me uninstall the game. To be fair, I needed space on my Xbox , but there�s just no new guns or anything, so I�m not even sad I did it"
"You unistalled it because they made a battlepass with content for the new game? Yall act like they don't do this every single year. The new cod gets the new content, only makes sense. And you can use the battlepass stuff in warzone, so thats why you can see it on mw"
"Uninstalled it once I got hit with another massive update. It said there wasn't enough space on my PS4, yet I was able to install another game no problem. The ridiculous updates toppled with the fact that they straight up abandoned this game killed any interest I had in it. Good riddance"
"You lost me when you claimed it was racist. What in the actual fuck?

I thought I�d seen it all with the CW hate in this sub."
"Focusing on the new game is racist? Go on cod ghosts and youll get advanced warfare ads, go on advanced warfare and youll see bo3 ads, go on bo3 and youll see infinite warfare ads, etc. New year, new game, they advertise the new game, old game doesn't get new content. Nothing new or crazy or malicious. just the cod cycle"
Exactly thank you man these people act like they didn't play a cod game before.
This is the way
"Is it really tbh man, isnt that boosting"
I love seeing videos like this.
r/codwarzone
"Ok. Can we have ""rusty old house boat"" instead?"
"Hate that StS is gone, but love they add Livestock 24/7"
Turn on Xbox. Load up MW. See that STS is gone. Turn off Xbox. Check back in a couple of weeks.
Fr. I want to get Damascus for warzone but they add shoot the ship for 1 week out of a month and I have to crunch it evwyetime
"I love how when shoot the ship is there everyone loves modern warfare but when it leaves everyone acts like the game is unplayable. Goes to say how bad most of the MW maps were. I loved the gunplay from modern warfare among many other things, but holy shit does it probably have the worst selection of original maps of any cod i have ever played. (Shoot house is the only saving grace and it came later)."
Some good maps in there but the rotation always puts in the worst ones haha.
I like maybe 1/3 of the MW maps (most of those are just remakes of previous cods). I think if they just brought back map voting in the pregame lobby it would make everyone a lot more happy
"Yep I Agree. The best cod in years let down by some stinkers in terms of new original maps. 

In my opinion the only good original 6 vs 6 maps are Shoothouse, Gun Runner and Hackney Yard. The others I like are remakes - Broadcast, Crash, Hardhat, Vacant, Backlot and Scrapyard. (And also Rust and Shipment for grinding) 

There are some truly awful maps in this game. Azhir Cave, Piccadilly, St Petrograd and Grazna Raid. Just boring camp fest pieces of shit."
Why do you people like shoothouse so much. It's 3 lane garbage. I hate that map with a passion.
Play other games
Like what?
Two different dev teams. One that actually listens to the community another that�s MIA aside from a couple individuals who engage on their own volition.

The 4v4 on livestock is insane I love it! Give it a try!
Going to try it after work. Read on another thread it's not on hc list though? I'll still give it a go with an open mind.
"Imo, i hate it. It takes 5 minutes to play a game and at 1 point every time i tried to leave a game because there was a camping ghost with a fal I would rejoin it, which happened 4 games. Plus spawns are shit, you can tell it was made for gunfight."
[removed]
"I�m trying to camo grind for the DLC guns, got on and after 2 games it�s gone again. If I�m playing for fun I don�t mind the usual modes but for camo grinding it�s gotta be shoot the ship"
"Same for me and my friends. 
90% of the maps in the game we don�t have fun playing, so we only play MW when they have shoot the ship but they keep taking it out which ruins the fun"
"The current playlist is worthless, grinding or otherwise.  

Headquarters firefight:
- 1st map Arklov Peak
- 2nd map Gun Runner
-(skip to) 5th map Piccadilly 

It�s reaching a point where I won�t play a game I bought because they keep making it worse.  Just like people say to Lucas with Star Wars, leave it alone because you�re ruining it."
"I'm off for some time as well, I already got Damascus and I'm trying to do most of the mastery challenges. 

It takes me ages to filter out the decent maps from the quick play hardpoint search.

It's just not worth it. Shoot the Ship is just perfect to hop on whenever you want to."
"Yep. I'm not even grinding, but I like playing the constant, A.D.D. action of STS. I hate running across a big map, just to get sniped and have to start all over. I like being dropped in the action."
LOL you gotta be fucking kidding me
The longer obj game modes has made 6v6 nukes easier to get tho
My oden that I didn't grind during shoot the ship waiting for gold camo: ah shit here we go again.
People give Cold War a lot of shit but they know how to do playlists. Nuke town has been there since launch and now they had a rapid fire playlist with small maps. I prefer mw to Cold War but I�m tired of them taking away sts it should be a permanent playlist. Well I�m off to grind dark matter until sts returns again because I refuse to grind for obsidian on regular maps it takes forever
"> People give Cold War a lot of shit but they know how to do playlists.

Lmao of course they do. They are actively killing MWs fun playlists to get people to play CW. If they get rid of Cold War's Nuketown playlist no one would play."
"Half way to obsidian crossbow and we don't even get a decent playlist. That sucks, been using obsidian grinds to distract myself from irl shit."
Am going to camp the shit out of my life to get Obsidian on my SKS now
livestock is fine for grinding
Bruh I was grinding the dual kodachis in shipment
I just don�t get how shipment isn�t a 24/7 option by now. Cold War gets it with 24/7 Nuketown as a permanent option. It�s so stupid
Just finished my grind for Damascus yesterday but I bet I'd be super pissed off if I didn't and saw it gone once again.Hell I'm fucken pissed knowing BOCW has Nuketown up since release and we only get STS for a week or two at a [time.At](https://time.At) this point it feels like Activision is pulling the strings telling people to fuck off and buy CW if they want a fast paced FPS game.I'd bet a grand that thing is also gonna happen to CW by the time the new COD is out.Fuck Activision and fuck Infinity Ward.
That�s shows how bad mw maps are if people only want shoot the ship
"It�s not that the maps are terrible, it�s just those maps are by far the best for grinding. You�d get the same response if Treyarch took away Nuketown as a playlist"
You people need to play other games lmao
I�m open to suggestions!
"So bad, they should put it back on!, or shipment 24/7, everyone now will just lobby surf for shipment anyways"
"12v12 search is goated.. haven�t seen it in over a month, shit SUCKS"
Was a little surprised to see I had every mode available when searching for a match. Why do they do this?
Thank god I finished the shield last night.
"Enough to make a grown man cry, thanks for sparing me the 5 minutes it would take to get on, I�ll be back when it�s back"
Bruh I only got one match of that FUCK
"It literally said ""new"" last night while playing. Why identify it as ""new"" if they just yanked it away. I am so lost on what their thought process is. People like it. Just keep it. Why is that such a hard consept to grasp."
"Breathe through it friend  :)

ShippyShooty is helpful for a lot of the Dam grind, but not all of it.

When I was doing the grind and they took StS off the list I'd just switch to doing the parts of the grind that are best done outside of Shoot House or Shipment � eg, grinding launchers for vehicle/equipment takedowns is more efficient to do in Free-For-All (Core, specifically) as that's where people seem to pop the most Personal Radars. 

Riot Shield 3-kill streaks are more efficient to grind on Rust than either Shooty or Shippy (at least it was for me). Also, and this will sound counterintuitive, but I had good luck with riot shield threes when playing Domination on Grazna Raid of all places. As long as your team is spawning on A-side you can camp in that room above B-flag, and when you see the indicator show that someone is taking B you just hop down out of the window, bonk 'em, then scurry back up to safety. 

Longshots can be grinded just about as efficiently on Hardhat, Khandor, and Euphrates Bridge as they can on Shoot House (although nothing is as efficient as Shipment for shotgun longshots haha)

In general there was plenty for me to do while I was waiting for ShippyShooty to come back around. 

I'll also add that it's *way better* to grind the launchers early instead of saving them for last. When you go into Free-For-All, equip the launcher as a secondary but spend the bulk of your time slowly grinding whatever rifle/pistol/etc you're working on, and then switch to the launcher when you hear a killstreak getting called in. If you leave launchers for last then you basically just end up sitting on your thumb for most of any given match, waiting for enemies to call in PRs. So much better to have something useful to work on while you're waiting for the PRs to come � plus that way you have a bit less to grind once StS comes back  :)"
TIME FOR NVGs!!!
"They�ve been consistently taking it out of rotation for the past 6 months, why are you surprised? It�ll be back in a week or two. 

I suggest playing search and destroy or headquarters. They cater to the other maps."
"Groan,  back to HC then... trudge, trudge...drags launcher."
"Wdym, they took out the hardcore tab? Also rip shipmemt for like the next 2 months probly, but livestock 4v4 will probably be a fun replacement"
milquetoast
can anyone explain why there never is a hardpoint hardcore..?
Only thing you get on shoot the ship so
I wish we still had 10v10 dom like earlier last year
Thank you for posting this every week for the players who can't jump on every Thursday afternoon to see what it is!
"You are very welcome! It rolls out at a convenient time for me, cheers from Europe!"
"lol Modern Warfare and Cold War are ridiculous. You know that there are people who play Face Off mode exclusively, right? I mean you (Activision) did create Face Off to be its own permanent mode in MW3, thereby creating a niche mode, which people would play exclusively and master. Now it's just a joke to both Activision and Treyarch. I quit Modern Warfare because you kept on adding and removing Face Off. Now I quit Cold War because they've done the same thing. COD just isn't what it used to be multiplayer-wise. I need to get my fast-paced-in-your-face-fast-gunplay elsewhere."
RIP SHITMENT :(
Ugh
I�m starting to lose hope
I�ve heard that the 11th will bring a MW content drop and that�s pretty much my last hope for these bundles. I want the Sokoly bundle so bad!
I thought it would be any day now since uk has gotten it
Yo I don�t even know if this is possible but can you send me 100 cod points so I can buy the battle pass??
Why�d you censor vault?
I don�t know but a lot of people are
"Nothing will ever come to MW, because they don�t care a shit about MW players anymore"
Oh you have to wait. Too bad so sad.
just saw it going away. I want to cry.
What did they replace it with?
[removed]
Same. 'Shoot the Ship' was the only reason I kept playing MW. 'Shoot House' is arguably the best MW map. Tried 'Livestock' but didn't like it at all. Guess not going back to MW until 'Shoop the Ship' becomes available for the next time.
Luckily I already finished Damascus this last week
"Nice, I still have 2 launchers to finish, 5 ARs, all shotguns and LMGs to finish. The JOKR is probably the only hard thing left on the grind I think. Thankfully I got the Riot Shield and Knife done and dusted. But that's now on hold, since Shoot the Ship is gone for this week at least."
Well my guy you have to weigh your options if you want the rose skin but don�t like the tracers or the design of the gun then don�t get it but if you really want a rose skin but don�t like anything else that comes with it if you want the rose skin just suck it up and get the pack you don�t have to use the other stuff in it
Never gonna happen unfortunately
"Imagine requesting some car manufacturers to let you buy that car body alone, they won't! 

I wish they will make bundles a little bit smaller in terms of items quantity."
I feel like I�ve noticed this too. It seems like the contrast gets fucked up sometimes and I have to restart my game
"Sadly, it doesn't get fixed for me after restarting the game. It just.. stays like that? idk man.."
Anyone?
"I�m sure you can change brightness and contrast levels somewhere in the game settings. If not then on your PC. But unless John Cena is in the picture this looks perfect to me. Much better than console. I can see the bullet holes down sight in the wall and an dead enemy gun on top the wall. 

If you�re getting killed while ADS on this map often watch the kill cam - prob coming from the side. Or a decent player is jump shooting from the other side because someone is always camped in your position."
"Wait, so you don't see the whole white wall? maybe its because of my monitor?"
Genuinely don't see the issue with this picture. Is it your monitor?
"Maybe it is, i had to tune down my contrast and now it looks kinda fine? whenever i try to look with a sniper scope tho it always shows all bright and stuff, like its just white. No line's of the wall and etc.   


Maybe it is just my monitor."
Where sun glasses dude
Bruh for a second my brain wasn�t completely focused and I thought you were in the back of Terminal.
Latency my guy
"??? what was *what*?

Are you confused as to why two shots to the foot and one to the body through a wall didn't kill?"
If you notice I missed my shots but I still got hitmarkers
[deleted]
I agree they need to make it 3 separate games. It's just a mess the way it is rn. Activison isn't very smart because they could make a lot of money with Modern Warfare but instead they are trying to kill it. Why is it so hard to update 2 games at the same time I just don't get it.
"If I remember correctly, I had to click on manage game and add-ons and install it from there. Otherwise if I tried to look up the game in the store or on the main screen, it wanted me to buy it. You have to install every single pack individually"
Absolute legend
If this works thats gonna be huge for me! Thanks!
Worked for me everytime I tried it! Thanks to the person bored enough to figure it out lol
"Did that, didn't work. Ps4 pro"
"It worked! But then after a game it didn�t work, but then it did again... even tho we allowed the points to add up."
"Mw killed my first Playstation and then I upgraded to a ps4 pro. Started to have overheating problems in 2 months. Eventually switched over to pc but yeah, absolutely ridiculous that issue still hasn't been addressed."
Get the heat sink cleaned on your PS4 . Mine is whisper quiet now . It would sound like a jet engine just sitting in the menu screen . When I had mine cleaned the heat sink was completely covered in dust .
"Lol if you cant beat them, join them. Oh wait, marksmen rifles actually require a little skill lol.

Edit: my very first ever reddit award! Thank you very much!"
No it's not
Just get better khed. or stop playing shoot the ship.
Wanna piss them off more than they piss you off?  Whip out a nostock VLKRogue with slugs on it and pump them with lead.  Faster output.  Equally as deadly.  Move way faster.
"Ty for this tips, i will take it"
Laughs in StS.
Use a rpg/shotgun and 2 proximity mines you'll get close to their score or beat it once you get the hang
"Ty for the help sir, i take it"
"You know, you could always just duck and slide lol"
That doesn't work all the time (sadly)
Aim higher.
U think?
"Lol. I�m the dude that flys around shoot the ship with a Lapua SPR, hitting every quickscope. Sorry fam (but not really)."
mad cause bad
"If you can actually join shoot the ship now that it's been removed yet AGAIN get an MP5/MP7 or a shotgun with dragon's breath rounds,spam stun or gas grenades,plant claymores/mines and shit on them.I do that whenever someone tries to shit on my game."
"Wow sir u actually going fire, like ur use every annoying thing to make them angry, tbo i keep this in mind so ty"
"With great gaming, comes great sacrifice."
gotta do what you gotta do
"that good, that's one less loose end"
Haha are you working on your tight five for the comedy club
I wish there was a better way of tracking your kill streak count and number of total nukes.
"TBH, I didn't know there was a way at all."
"What I find even better is 9 times out of 10 you are stomping the enemy anyway. If someone went on a 30 killstreak, unless it's groundwar and they are camping in a window in some corner of the map you are seriously helping your team going on a streak like that.

Imagine if in WW2, when Germany was invading France and they were clearly winning and then the day before they surrendered, Germany just said ""fuck it nuke em"" then proceeded to wipe out their entire army stationed in France and the last remains of the French army. That's the equivalent of what is happening."
It's a real Chad move nuking your team that is clearly winning
" 'can actually see your enemies'

Yet CW is very well known for having dogshit poor visibility."
"For real hahaha, I've never had a problem with MW visibility. With CW it's like everyone blends into the background, it's bizarre. I don't know if it's the lighting in the engine or what but I can't see shit at times"
"I get it pretty bad from time to time. Every match in this game, I get the obligatory lag spike. Servers are rough in this game rn."
Its happen to me before but i just think theres too many people on my wifi
I�m convinced they reallocated way more server priority to CW than they should have and now the MW player base is paying for it.
"Trust me, the Cold War servers aren�t any better haha."
We didn't deserve this didn't we? :)
nice jooj referenc
Oh you're man of culture as well.

Do you have a next-gen gen console by chance?
"Yes I�ve got a PS5, so wondering if it�d just make my game look nicer"
I have a question for PS player's.. on Xbox when you download the high-res pack 3 it uninstalls 2. If you redownload 2 it unistalls 3. All still are installed in system SSD but it just won't show them all installed in the game menu. Is that happening in PS?
"Haven�t had this happen, I have all 3 downloaded. (PS5)"
You don�t need them
Yeah they doesn't need them but should they download them to get the best out of the game?
"Mw3 survival is miles better anyways, so just play that

But yeah it makes no sense. Its not like there isnt already split screen for multiplayer"
Search for a game. Then button shows then.
"It's because they're for Modern Warfare, not Cold War which the Battle Pass is for."
BP tokens work on all games and modes.
It gets the black stock.
the iso isn�t required for damascus.  no gun that was added after the game initially released is required for damascus
"Most categories were fun for me, to my surprise, but launchers take too long honestly. If you truly love MW then I highly recommend but you have to start using launchers while using other guns or you�ll spend a week staring at the sky with these launchers."
With shoot the ship out. Hell yah if you are okay with putting it many hours.
It's gone
"I've got all ARs, all SMGs, all LMGs,half the shotguns, one marksman rifle, and 2 handguns.

What you really need to do is level them all up first then work on the camos. Less stressful that way.

Also fuck the launchers, i hate those things

This will tell you what you need.

[https://damascus.now.sh/](https://damascus.now.sh/)"
"All pistols, 2 handguns?"
How many other golds/platinums do you have
"Get platinum ARs then decide. To be honest Obsidian looks way better, I only use Damascus on secondaries now."
"Well bad news, the Iso being a dlc weapon, doesn't count towards platinum or indeed Damascus.

Also, imo Damascus is ugly and not worth the torture of launchers and the shield, this is coming from a guy who has platinum or every weapon class except those two, and I never will."
"Just go HC Shipment and people will help you. For launchers also you have the choice of playing ground war. You will finish within a week if you wanted, it's doable."
For pistols go for hardcore
Those spawns are atrocious
"nice

what gun is that?"
"Striker 45, aka UMP 45.

It's shit but in hardcore that doesn't really matter."
have u ever tried what i like to call the wombo wombo combo it is a wheelson vtol jet and a support helo
"Man, I cannot control the wheelson for the life of me but that is a deadly combo."
You need the name plus numbers. And activision recently made everyone�s info private unless allowed by the user so unless they have that idk if you�ll be able to see their info.
"Yeah, so as I suspected, the numbers are pointless. The player in question was a blatant WZ cheater. Have footage, and screenshots of the name. But I posted it here before and my post was deleted by the admins. When cheaters are protected, you know there's an issue...."
"If you want to look up someone�s stats just use that CoDtracker website, it�s just like the one for R6."
"The name is in chinese characters.... Also, I posted a screenshot here, but it got taken down -\_-"
"You just gotta wait for it to pop up in the store, remember to check both MW and WZ stores.

I have had this skin for a long time and it's cool, the ghillie stuff can freak me out sometimes, when it twirls into my vision out of nowhere."
"smh I NEVER see any bundles that don't have weapons in store

i just want the watch"
It shows in the store on my ps5?
"I'm on PC, just checked and it's not there :(

Is it in ""just for you"" section?"
"Like all store bundles, each one rotates through. Having said that, there are a number from season 1, such as the Bronze Knight bundle, I haven't seen in ages. Just have to be patient I guess..."
I became a navy seal just so I could quick scope with my SPR
"Speed doesn't matter in online gaming.

Having a low and stable ping is what matters."
"I would hands down pay for a gigabit connection even if very expensive and even if that was only for CoD. I've been dealing with my 5Mbps connection since mid-2008, initially it was 6Mbps, then it was updated to 10 (formally, never went above 8) and last summer it dropped again, this time even lower than the one I had in 2008, 5.5Mbps when lucky. My 4G swings from 2 to 20Mbps and the ping is close to 100 so I can't use it to play. Someone offers 30Mbps FWA internet (wi-fi, just to be clear) but they're well known for being unstable and so not adapt to gaming and they also suffer from saturation, meaning that when many people use them, their performances drop wildly, not to talk about rain and fog etc.

Now they said that they're going to cover the entire country with Starlink, that's expensive as fuck but I would hands down pay for it, if it had good and stable performances. We'll see, but it's crazy that I need to rely on a foreign company to have a half decent internet connection in 2021. I even risked to see a university exam wiped by my connection since the video call stopped for entire minutes twice.

I swear till last week my right hand was violet for all the stomps on the desk and I'm still bearning two wounds. Infuriating as fuck. It has also ruined my study because I'm so nervous most of the times for sucking because of my connection that I can barely find the focus. My connection has poisoned my life so much that no price could be high enough to put an end to this tragicomedy."
I feel your pain haha. I grew up having to use dial-up and then a 3g usb Hotspot to game on. Now I�m using an AT&T hotspot on until I can move and get cable/fiber. Gaming has always been very frustrating where I live.
"I had already a gigabit connection before MW come out, but even with this high speed I would get lag in some matches recently. I would say it depends on the host of the match and how good their connection are."
there is no host.  its dedicated servers.
Hardcore mode keep distance I found to be easiest and some maps are much better than others youll find
Ok gonna try out thx.
I played shoothouse and did it in 4 games
25 Long shots each game? :/
"Shoot house in hardcore is definitely the best option. Just go to the walls right at the beginning, there is always someone on the opposite wall. You have shoot the ship for a couple of hours still, try to enjoy it until the new playlist comes around. It way faster than other maps."
"I'd say either Ground War or Hardcore Domination. Avoid shoot the ship, far too hectic and close range."
"Objective based modes, hardpoint and headquarters I find the best because it shows how many meters away the objective is so you can camp right within that distance, it�s a slow and painful process that I find myself going if I can get 2 or 3 a game I�ll have them done in a week. I also start trying for them as soon as I unlock the challenge that way I�m not left being done everything else and am stuck with just long shots for gold."
Ground war or plunder tbb
"I just did it to get gold on my M4a1, its the hardest of the camo challenge trees for me. The best way I found was in warzone plunder and drop in a hot spot like airport/storagetown/train and you can get a fair number of people in that area dropping constantly."
"I personally handle longshots easiest on HC Shoothouse, 3 spots, Office looking into spawn, The concrete block behind the burning truck by C flag looking across the map towards the A flag spawn and vice versa. and also i find that building the gun your using to have the least range possible kinda shortens the range you need to have a kill considered as a longshot."
"When Warzone Rumble happens, grind for long shots if you can."
I forgot the name of the game mode but try the large scale battle mode and just camp out
I think you mean ground war but famas had zero damage on mid range so I think that kids with hdr would beat shit out of me xd.
Shoothouse but if a playlist isn�t there hardpoint is nice. People will always be running around the hardpoint and most hard points have a longshot spot you can find.
"Ground war, hard core cheshire bus lane and shoot house mid lane"
"Just play hardpoint and challenge people at range, don't play tiny shit maps like Shoothouse where you make yourself miserable."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/kmorc1/fix_for_coop_installation_suspended_error_message/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Here's an article, hope it helps. It worked for me"
"Thanks, I uninstalled one data pack and it workd"
"lmao i loaded up my game after an update and i was looking for modern warfare but all i could find was warzone. the title of the game, the logo, nothing said mw. i was pretty confused but i figured it out eventually lol."
There's a MW in one corner.
"I still think warzone should get its own launcher, and should be uninstallable, rather than being a required part of the modern warfare install"
"While I agree, I think the reason it�s tied to Modern Warfare is the amount of objects it�s shares with MW. Like there are whole ground war maps that�s use objects for Warzone and large amounts of the Warzone map are MP maps. To separate them out would require two massive games, where you could only fit 2 of MW, CW, and WZ."
Yeah the game should be like every other 500 CoD�s and be standalone. Warzone should be separate that�s accessible through the games.
Making Warzone separation from MW would mean that installing both MW and Warzone would take up even more space on a hard drive than it does right now because Warzone would need to install its own copies of all the assets instead of just sharing a file system with Modern Warfare.
Its seems very annoying that it used to be warzone is a mode of mw and now mw is mode of warzone.
"I just want them to stop shoving Cold War in my face every time I play MW. The first tab on the main menu is to buy Cold War. Season passes you can buy on modern warfare, without even touching warzone, are all Cold War unlocks. Cold War is just piggy backing the shit out of MW�s success with warzone. When I boot up MW/warzone, stop trying to push me into Cold War. When you make a season pass on modern warfare. Don�t make it full of Cold War shit. When you offer a free limited time event, don�t make it into a store link to Cold War. If I wanted a treyarch COD I would get it, but I don�t so get it out of my face while I enjoy the game that IW nailed."
"What the the fuck were you expecting, the game's life cycle have ended so the battlepass will be for CW only, also why the fuck do people care about the main menu? It only connects all of the games together, if you wanted content for MW only you should've bought it when it launched so deal with it."
Cry me a river i payed for black ops 2 why aren�t they still releasing content for it why can�t my black ops cold war battle pass items be used in black ops 2 i payed for it. Cod has been like this every year a new one comes out and that�s the one that gets updates.
"Did Black ops 2 lose its name ? -Did it cease to exist when you start it up ,Icons ,Loading screen ?"
And maybe fix the crashes when loading into a new game
Yes you can use them.
"Yea cod points carry across games since they are tied to your account, so even if you bought cod points in Cold War you could still use them in mw assuming your on the same account."
"If the bundle has the MW logo on it, then yes."

welcome to the club man. are you going to get the dlc weapons damascus too?
"Thanks! I already have a few DLC guns that I got to gold on the way, just because I thought they were fun: Fennec, Grau, Bruen, and a couple others, I think. Next I plan to get a couple more obsidian skins that I�m close to earning, then ???"
"I�m grinding rn man, any tips?

AR�s take really long lol"
"AR's may have been the grindiest part, because there are so many of them and the numbers required for camos were often higher than for things like SMGs (if my memory's correct). Shoutout to melee and launchers for not being enjoyable either...

Here are some tips I just wrote for a different post: 
* Look up what counts for each type of launcher camo, I.e. �Ground streaks� isn�t as bad as you think, because half the killstreaks that fly count.
* Use Double XP tokens to level the hardest weapons up as fast as you can. If you can get a weapon to max level relatively quickly, it cuts down the time spent getting camos by a massive amount.
* Play hardcore, it�ll help so much for pistols/shotguns/etc. And it�s practically impossible to get the shield gold outside of HC.
* Play Shipment with the riot shield, and ask for help. People may only respond every 4-5 matches, but it�ll be sooooo worth it. I offered to trade, �Who wants to trade kills/3-kills in the middle container�. It works.
* Focus on the launchers right from the start. If you knock down every kill streak you see for months, you won�t get to the end and only have launchers left (which seems to happen to a most people).
* Multitask - If you have some weapon where you need crouching/long shots/mounted, do all three at once if possible.
* Personal opinion: use Shoot the Ship as much as you possibly can. Shipment itself basically triples your leveling speed. I suck at sniping, but I could take a sniper on that map and bumble my way to 30 kills every time, easy. I got almost every �no attachments� camo in the game on Shipment, snipers included.
* (someone else said that getting knife kills is easier on Core vs HC, as one hit still kills them, but you're a little harder to kill, so one bullet may not kill you. I didn't try that though, so YMMV)"
"I got damascus last july and i have a couple tips
-take advantage of double xp weekends becayse levels take a long time
-shoothouse is great for longshots
-besides longshots play shipment only
-hc is really good with some ars, lmgs, shotguns pistols and launchers"
"Yeah, ARs took me forever. I�d say the hardest or at least most annoying are the Riot Shield and the JOKR launcher."
"Launchers I played harcore shoot the ship
People pop counter uav and uav a lot.

Melee.... just.... goot luck... I did it all in HC dom or shoot the ship. It was my first thing I got plat and I had a breakdown and begged people to help me do it. 

Snipers you need a lot of luck for the 3 kills without dying. I think I did the HDR and ax50 in ground war"
"If you need mounted kills and longshots, another useful place I found was the massive concrete block in between C flag leading into Junkyard. Use the destroyed jeeps to vault onto the concrete block thing and place a Deployable Shield down and you can see all the way down into Shanty Town, half of Junkyard and you're also able to get off the mount and look left to see if any enemies try to come from the Containers side of the map near the forklift into where C flag would be."
"For the shield, hop into ffa and you'll get some kind souls who'll sacrifice their Kd for the 3 kills without dying. I say ffa so you can speak throughout the game. It really, really helped me"
"You can hop from the burned out keep to the grey shipping container on shoot house. Put down a deploy able shield and it gives you a great line of sight down the right lane, perfect for longshots"
1.5 year long grind
Damascus looks amazing on shoothouse but terrible on rust
Shoot house is just amazing
"Weird. I didn�t play any matches past that one on Shoot House, so I haven�t seen it in other lighting..."
Welp now that you have Demascus get ready for people today say �YoUrE dOg ShIt AnD yOu HaVe DeMaScUs.�so fucking annoying
"Haha. I�m not great, so I�m sure I�ll hear that a lot. 

Plus side, now I get to be the dickbag who says, �Wow you�re trash, you don�t even have Damascus?!�"
Got Damascus yesterday and now I just feel empty inside after a whole month of non-stop grinding...
I�m planning on trying meth as my next hobby! I�ll let you know how it goes!
"It gets better, enjoy warzone with your fancy skins bro you've earned it"
May I interest you in obsidian??? The challenges are more straight forward at least
"Play Ghost of Tsushima, takes the edge off"
"Hell yea! I got damascus last month and have noticed my game play has gone down significantly since, haha, I think I'm just a lot more relaxed about playing now"
I�m trying for Damascus too after the massive disappointment that Cold War was for me. Any tips with launchers? How do I gold them on out on Shoot the Ship?
"It's a grind, but you need to focus on knocking down every killstreak you see, in the air or on the ground.

* Look up what counts for each launcher camo category, as their titles don't match what you get credit for... Half the flying kill streaks count towards the 'Ground vehicle' camo.
* You can use a luncher to melee Shield Turrets and Sentry Guns, and it counts towards your camo. Often on Shipment it's way easier to just bash a Sentry Gun to death, vs trying to get the JOKR far enough away and at the right angle to destroy it.
* Always have spotter equipped, unless you're on the 'amped kills' camo.
* Be prepared to get killed a ton on Shipment while you're looking up.
* I suggest having a class with a PKM as the weapon, then the STRELA or RPG as the secondary. Every time a VTOL goes up, nade yourself if you have to, then switch to that class. The PKM gets the VTOL to the 'black smoke' stage very fast, then switch to your point-and-shoot launcher and finish the job. Yes, you'll run into others on the grind who snake your kills, after you do the damage...
* For shipment I had the same class in three slots, but named 'RPG', 'STRELA', and 'JOKR'. Insta-rotate as needed, based on what kill streak just went up.
* Anecdotally, I saw way more Personal Radars/UAVs on Shoot House, vs Shipment, and you don't get insta-killed as often while you're trying to shoot stuff down.
* You *can* shoot down UAV's with RPGs! You just need to visualize the straight line that the UAV's traveling on, then lead it 4-5"" on screen. Lead distance varies based on how far away the UAV is, which means it's easier on smaller maps, as they appear closer. Also, crouching seems to straighten out the RPG's shots?
* I never had luck shooting down UAV's with the STRELA. Not saying it can't be done, but I never got a single one in like 30 tries. Maybe I just suck at it!"
"Here�s another one just on how to approach the camos that worked for me. While Shoot the Ship was in rotation, I did all of the camos for each launcher that required me to actually kill people. I knew I needed the madness of Shipment and the familiarity with Shoothouse to get these kills. I played Core because I died too fast trying to get shots off in HC. These were my rules:

1. Until JOKR was done, I played with this class whenever I had an objective based mode for Attacker and Defender. On shipment, spam JOKR rockets at objectives. You finish these camos very fast when you do this as objectives constantly switch possession in shipment and you�ll get attacker or defender based on who possesses the objective. You die A LOT before you get a shot off many times, so any opportunity you have to get both rockets off before you die is pure gold. 
2. Second priority was Strela because it�s very frustrating with a small blast radius for killing people. I prefer to finish the most annoying first. 
3. PILA was third priority. I played with this for kills after finishing the other two. (I had RPG kills done when I started actually focusing on launchers)
4. I used only the Amped perk until kills were done then switched to Spotter. I started to run specialist with Hardline and Amped equipped from the start, and Spotter in my first extra perk slot (only takes one kill to get with hardline)
5. I obviously still focused on kill streaks in non-objective modes, while on this launcher kill mini-grind. 

Once all kills were complete, I focused on kill streaks only. This is much much more chill. The order I did this in for my personal preference was JOKR, Strela, RPG, PILA. I�m on my last few camos for the PILA and it is a relaxed, mindless grind with streaks. This also allows you to play other maps and modes as you prefer since killstreaks are always there."
"I�m kind of close to Damascus. All I have left is launchers but man I wish to used them when I first got the game significantly more. I�m almost done with the strela-p, 75% done with rpg, 50% with jokr and barely touched the first one (forgot the name). Shield and knife were painful as well."
"IMO the PILA is the easiest. It can do �point and shoot� or quick lock-on. Doesn�t have a killstreak that it struggles with, compared to the other three!"
Damn I left knife to last because I thought it would be the most fun / easiest
Way to go and welcome to the club.
Is shoot house 24/7 permanent on this game yet?
"Hum... This only happened to me when they released a new big update and I forgot to uncheck 'read only"" on .exe properties."
"I very much doubt we will have sts for a 3rd week in a row unless they are deciding to make it permanent. Although it�s possible since they kept the by far most popular playlist during the Cold War free week. 

I actually don�t think that someone is actually rotating these playlists personally. I think they are just set on a timer that randomly cycles through x playlists in a queue, on Thursday at x time. And we get randomly generated cycles, we could get sts 3 weeks in a row or we could not see it again for 6 months, I think the only human based interaction with the play list cycle is what they add or remove to the pool of possible playlists."
I enjoy the polls. I�d like you to keep doing them
What even is this
It�s just a poll to see what game modes you think are gonna be in the playlist update today around 1-3 in modern warfare 2019
I already have damascus and many guns obsidion but i still play sts just for fun. Shoothouse is an amazing map besides office.
What was your way of going through the shotguns and lmgs
Keep Gunfight OSP
That�s a good idea but they usually change them but I would like that
Most underrated mode in MW
"hey OP, has the mode change happened yet?"
No it happens around 1-3
Yep that does make sense. Lol. That means if STS stays I could get it this week
I hope we get 3v3 knives man
Good news
I want Reinforce back!!!
"Same. It's absolutely criminal that that mode has only been in the game for ~3-4 weeks total. It's amazing and deserves a permanent spot (or should at least rotate once per season)

They have like 4 alternate playlist spots a week. That's enough to alternate between all LTMs every month surely."
"Can anyone tell me how to do a player lookup??? We get given this #Number.... Why can't I use it to look up the stats of this player???? If anyone could help out, it would be great! Thanks."

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)

Commands: `!fordo`, `!optout`"
I heard about it but tbh I have no clue what it actually is and I'm kinda scared of it tho xd.
"Not sure if we'll get another week of Shoot the Ship but if it's still active this morning hop on Hardcore -> Shoot the Ship to get all the ""Kill enemies"" challenges done.

You can just run around melee killing people (plus if you target the far corner with a rocket you'll usually get a kill or two).

In fact I'd suggest getting all the JOKR enemy-related challenges done this morning while Shipment is still accessible without having to back out of 25 matches to find it, and then switching to the other launchers and doing the anti-personnel challenges in those ones too. (Including the Attacker/Defender camos.)

Once all your anti-personnel challenges are done, switch back to the JOKR and head into Core -> Free-For-All to look for Personal Radars.

From what I've observed people tend to use PR in Free-For-All more than any other mode (since you don't have any teammates who'd benefit from a UAV).

And they tend to use it more in Core-FFA than Hardcore-FFA.

It's best not to leave the launchers for last, so you can spend your time maining a rifle or pistol and then just switch to the launcher when someone pops up a killstreak. 

Having left launchers to last, you'll spend a lot of time just getting frustrated that no one is popping up PRs.

But just stick with it. When you find a lobby where someone is using PR, remember what part of the map you saw them and sprint back to it after they kill you. Keep feeding them kills, then as soon as the pop up a PR, kill them and start their killstreak cycle over again.

EDIT: Also wanted to add, in Ground War on Tavorsk you can find a camping spot on a high-up rooftop and target vehicles pretty easily while they're still deep in their own territory and unlikely to get blown up before your rocket reaches them. Use tactical insertion and Tune-Up so you can suicide when you're out of ammo and respawn back in your launcher blind with full pockets."
"I'm slowly doing Master challenge for JOKR so I can add some points.

Launcher kills - Shipment hardcore. Keep spamming the rocket each time you spawn.

Vehicle/Killstreak - GW is the best. Ground vehicles will be an ass because they will be targets for all players grinding for all kinds of launcher camos. For Air Streaks, I would actually prefer camping at your home team spawn, position yourself to an area with clear view of the sky, honestly, I wouldn't recommend going after VTOL/Heli/Chopper/Gunship because most likely you won't be able to shoot them down. 

Go after P Radar, UAV, Counter-UAV. and out of these 3, prioritize on shooting down UAV because most of the time your teammates will shoot down P-Radar and C-UAV first."
"Hopefully the STS playlist stays on for another couple of weeks. I totally forgot that it�s Thursday today where they would change the playlists. 

So my priority would have to be getting the Defender and Attacker kills right? The other camos would just come naturally wouldn�t it?"
GW Promenade
Alright thanks man!
"Shipment works surprisingly well for kills, especially if its an objective game mode."
Alright thanks a lot bro!
Shoot house
Alright thanks bro!
Shipment helps a lot
Thanks a lot man! Only thing is they had just removed STS. But it ain�t gonna stop me though since i�ve came this far. Only got 3 launchers left.
Attacker/Defender camos - > Hardpoint
Thanks a lot man!
"I'd recommend leveling up the launchers to the max level before you start going for camos because there are a lot of camo categories that overlap.

I leveled all the launchers up in Plunder. Pop a double weapon xp token, grab a chopper, and run supply run contracts. You can max out each launcher in like 3 games.

I saved the launchers to the end as well, and all I can say is... good luck haha"
"Alright will be sure to try them out soon. Yeah bro the only different camo category is the attacker/defender and the kill enemies category. The other ones are pretty much the same and always count in every category.

Yeah bro I�m starting to regret leaving the launchers for last lol. But hey, if I had done the launchers first, then I might not be able to complete my shield, knife and pistols lol.

But still, thanks for the help though bro!"
"Domination for kill challenges and for streak challenges free for all. Also, if kill leader is at 20 kills in FFA and you haven�t seen much streaks or if someone with one of the other faster launchers is shooting down streaks I would just leave and look for a better game. Perks I ran on my class were cold blooded for when Vtols or sentry guns came up, ghost just to be hidden from UAVs(perk 2 could be anything but overkill though), and either amped for the kill challenges or spotter for the kill streak challenges. Worst part of the grind was definitely leveling up the weapon, but after that it was just being patient and letting the launcher do it�s thing. Hopefully this helps and good luck."
"Yup I�m playing FFA at the moment to get the kill streaks done first on all the launchers now that STS is gone so when it comes back, I can just focus on getting the Attacker/Defender kills done.

Yeah bro grinding the levels are pretty tiring but still, it�s better than grinding weapons on Cold War where it is extremely slow, even with Double XP on. I might try to go on Plunder and spam Supply Run contracts to get the launchers to max level first before grinding the camos. Would be a waste to do the same thing repeatedly since most of the camos on the launchers are just similar to each other.

Anyway, thanks a lot for the tips bro!"
Damn how high is your brightness?
It�s a weird thing happens when capturing hdr video on the PS4 my game doesn�t acctually look like that. Hdr helps me see in dark spots a bit better that�s why I use it
Kind of hard to spot anything with this blurry resolution.
When moving around  the capture in hdr gets more pixley also photo is taken on my phone trust me you cannot see him it was impossible
"""I just happen to like the Roze skin"" They always have the most meta weapons too."
"Yeah don�t get me wrong the operator isn�t bad it�s just invisible in most spots this happens with other operators to, in warzone my friend had to clutch the win because I died to An operator that looked exactly like the rock face when he was lying down  but I guess it would play a role as camo irl"
"It was up for couple days only. I bought it as soon as it came out.  


But.............there's hope. I was playing Warzone 2 days ago and I found the blueprint in a crate. I was really surprised and that usually means the bundle will be back in the store this season, because they love to advertise blueprints like that. Keep an eye on the store every day, you never know."
"That Uzi shreds for real. People shit on it because of the thermal hybrid but it's got the ammo conversion, mono, and 2 other attachments. Really great early game floor loot"
yeah i got the blueprint too and thats why i want to get it. rly hope youre right about it showing up
I check for this pack every day!
Wtf I�ve never seen that bundle I would of gotten in a heart beat .
"The new bundles just don't release for everyone. It's a known bug, but it's not on the Trello board yet, so not sure if Raven is aware."
"New MW bundles only last a week now. Roze unmasked, Lerch Gassed up, Domino Akira, etc... all about 6 days then removed from the store. No warning."
But they leave in all of the executive armory BS
Dirty tactics. Instead of giving us all bundles they gotta cycle them through to create the illusion of exclusivity.
It released late December. Didn�t show up for everyone though and I hasn�t been back since.
"It released for everyone (because all my friends saw it as I told them it's in the store), just nobody was bothered to check the store as there was no announcement from anyone.

I log in every day (either to play or check if I want to do any dailies) and I saw it. Quickly bought it. It was only up for 2-3 days."
"It has been back as I bought it in February, but pops up at random times."
"Go to the Uzi in create a class, select 'store' next to it, look for the Tsuiso blueprint, and it should pull up the bundle"
"Naw man, doesn't work. been checking almost daily for a month that way and nothing"
This trick rarely has what you want anymore. Its really been limited stock since Black Ops season 1 started.
it was out for a week then removed
"1 week? I don't think so, I check the store a couple of times a day. And I have never seen it."
I think it released on the 12th of january and stood up for like 5-6 days. I got it the moment it came out cuz I remember seeing the leaks of new MW bundles with the black ops season 1 bundles and was super surprised to see it pop up in the live store. Too bad it's super fucking red or i'd use it in warzone all the time
Still waiting...what am I looking at/for?

"Poor man got spawn killed by a knife, them immediately spawned next to where he died and got executed :("
im gonna try this now
"Haha, I'll have to watch for you. On our knife only round (this was Lmg -a nd why everyone was dead at spawn) I hid in a box to the left of site in the supplies tent and got a kill, then watched the body for a res and got that kill. 

Some sneaky stuff you can do when you catch people off guard."
This is the worst gameplay I've seen here bar none.
�Hyper ADHD mode� Gets one double kill...
smh my head its about how hyper i was 4 it
No wonder I still haven�t seen those packs in my shop up until now. Checked it everyday and on time when the store bundles refresh since I really want that Mara S1 skin.
"Yeah, and I just want the Bale Sokoly pack :/ honestly I don't care about any of the above except for the soviet head cushion skin xD The base execution makes too much sense in it xD  


But it's kind of frustrating when from firsthand experience, it's clear MW has turned into a cash cow. But they can't even milk it properly. That's how unbothered the management is about our community."

"yea it's a blast. Tried it out in warzone, insane hesdshot damage, and its AR rounds so you get 210 reserve ammo lol"
"Good in MP, no good in Warzone. Doesn�t have enough range to run it the way I�d like to."
"Unlike the SKS and M14 the AS VAL quickly loses it's 2 shot kill potential when you shoot people at range or hit them in the arms/legs, and it even loses the one-shot headshot, so you might as well use the FAL which has bigger mags, lower recoil and a very similiar damage profile. The only notable difference is that up close the VAL can 2-hit kill in the stomach whereas the FAL only 2-shot kills in the upper chest."
"AS VAL is for campers, run around killing everybody without giving a damn to the match object. That is what happens crossing players using it.
The mag is enough for campers I guess"
"Not the normal 20-30 rounds, and with 10 rds you it�s hard to rush more than 2 people, you have to be a good player, constantly going behind cover"
Should of bought a Xbox
Great help that
So he can't even have is own voice in audio clips? Good try.
"Did you install Warzone before buying and installing MW? If so, I'd try and delete the whole thing and reinstall MW from scratch."
"I had both WZ and Cold War installed prior to last night installing all the MW packs, on my PS5 in the storage settings it literally has the MW logo/game under installed games but it still asks me to purchase it when I try to access it. I will try to uninstall WZ and download it all again! Thanks"

"Are you trying to load modern warfare through the warzone app? Try uninstalling the warzone standalone app if you have it, and uninstall then reinstall whatever modern warfare files you have from that game's page. I don't know that this would work, but it's what I would try first."
"I had this problem as well, but I have to ask you a question. Are you using a friends account to download mw? If so, you may not have his account set as primary. You have to set his account as primary, in order to be able to actually play the game."
Use the feather bolt assembly and you have the fastest.
"focus is excellent for quickscoping because it reduces flinch by a lot. bolt assembly is not really needed, spr fires fast enough. 338 lapua ammo increases the one shot area and increases bullet velocity so it can be used with the short barrel much better.

my favourite setup is: 338 laupa magnum, tac laser, blitz stock, sniper scope and focus perk. its a bit slower than some setups but it packs a punch"
Marksmens don�t need focus as they�re pretty accurate.
"Mono suppressor, zlr asp barrel, solozero 28mm scope, tac laser and xrx blitz stock"
"use the feather bolt, the deadeye decreases your rate of fire while the feather increases, making follow up shots faster and easier"
"i use the shortest barrel, the solozero 7x scope, blitz stock, .338 lapua and tac laser.
made quickscoping really fun"
Do you play hardcore or core? Are you consistent?

"I swear man this game has an issue right after another, I guess we just gotta hope they fix it soon and not 2 weeks later."
"I had the same issue, where I would start with getting good frames (varying between 100 and 150) and it then dropping to 50 to 70 soon after.

I had some other issues that where caused by GPU Tweak 2 and since I deinstalled it, I set the graphics settings and never touched them again in fear of the game not being playable again.

So the only thing I could suggest is turning off msi afterburner and all other unnecessary programs in the background and see if there is an improvement.

Also the FPS seem to vary wildly based on the servers."
"ok, thanks for the tip. how can servers impact fps? weird"
I'm having similar issues to you with a RTX 3070. I'm at the point where I can't even get into the menu without 20-30 fps. The game was running fine a week ago. Hopefully there will be a patch soon.
damn I guessed that more people have this kind of issue. it�s super annoying and not worthy for a $900 gpu. if it would stay between 120 and 150 it would be fine but these drops are trash
"Like the other user said, for some weird ass reason, FPS seems to be connected to server performance, somehow."
Turning off nvidia reflex in game seems to help with fps in my experience with the 3090 and 10700k and 32gbs cl 18 ram.
yeah I already disabled that since it�s a dx11 feature in a dx12 game
"You checked what temperatures your GPU and CPU are, in case something is throttling?

It might be worth trying ISLC ([https://www.wagnardsoft.com/ISLCw](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/ISLCw)) and Process Lasso ([https://bitsum.com/](https://bitsum.com/)) to see if they help inprove anything."
"i�ll try that, thanks. my cpu is at 50-60 and gpu first 68-71 and in the end 63 when gpu usage dropped"
It could also be your current driver.  Revert back to a previous one and try that.  Sometimes certain drivers don't play well with certain games.
"Honestly until there�s a patch, you should figure out the average frame rate you get and set your FPS cap to that frame rate. This is to prevent huge fluctuations which causes choppiness. 

Or just drop down to 1080p...which I know, with a capable system like yours, it�s sad."
found a way around
"For what it�s worth I�ve been experiencing the same thing on Xbox Series X recently.  On 120hz mode it progressively gets worse as I play, and when I put it back to 60hz it feels like it�s running at 20fps."
xbox is probably throttled by  thermals. Try removing the case and test it open.
Its supposedly a glitch when you set your operators as random in multiplayer
ok thanks

That a new skin? Looks dope

"Original Mara was a skin from season 1 battle pass.

No, if you buy a skin, it unlocks the operator to play as in that skin. You cannot unlock other skins for her unless they are included in a bundle.

They did intend to release season 1 vault bundles, and her original skin would�ve been available in one of those- this was announced in October or November of last year and they never came to fruition. No telling if they ever will to be honest.

These bundles would�ve been available to purchase when they released for around 2,000 cod points."
"They just added the Bundles, the original skin is like 1500 I just checked. There's a second original skin Bundle with more stuff included for 2400 too.

Go for it if you want, and see how your game runs. you can find them in the install manager at the bottom of the general settings"
Also just know that there is a bug that keeps them from all being installed. If you have 1&2 installed the moment you install 3 it's going to uninstall 2. If you reinstall 2 it's going to uninstall 3... It may not happen to you but there are post discussing the problem.

Adding to what you said, turning on tritanopia color blind mode in the game settings makes visibility a lot better in general. turn off film grain too. I also turned on the ""gaming mode"" preset on my monitor, and turned the contrast up a little bit more than that already did. I have no visibilty issues on ps4 pro and doing all that made it a LOT better when i played on xbox"

They probably just have a few artists who's job is to crank them out. Plus some of the calling cards reuse concept art and other promotional stuff. Only a few though.
That's where the storage space goes = shit gun dingle berries
In CW it's all recycled shit from old games or cards and emblems with no animation. People like to take a dump on MW but they really took the time to make new fresh work.
"I agree honestly, the MW selection of emblems and calling cards looks really cool, and are original for the most part, that�s why I�m curious as to who made them."

Use other blueprint if you want to get ride of it. The Kar in obsidian looks amazing tho
Yeah I have the old growth blueprint and that�s what I use because it gets rid of the sling
"This is an additional part for weapons (from another skin). This is not only for kar98.

Added info: I mean this is like extra thing."
Use the base kar98 model no blueprint and then make it obsidian
"I actually prefer this, obsidian is hard to notice without it contrasting something."
do you know what blueprint keeps the brown sling? also if you use the variable scope from tower blueprint it gives a gold scope with obsidian
"Just an FYI I�ve read one to many people claiming to have been wrongfully banned whose story starts strangely similar to your post. 

The ole �I was doing xyz while matchmaking and then all of a sudden my game crashed. Load it up and I�m permabanned�. 

Most doing innocuous things that wouldn�t warrant it. Not strictly on topic but just a heads up. Their anticheat is overtweaked. I�d recommend doing that on another device while lobby surfing unless you�re ok with the risk of becoming another false positive. 


As for your question, does it resolve once you return to the game? There have been many people who report performance dips when alt tabbing out of modern warfare. It could be related to that."
Get a better PC
Not sure how it works with a ban but I think you usually get a name change token every 6 months or something like that
"I hadn't changed my username since season 2 of MW, we're in season 2 of CW. I'm either nearing the token or I'll never get one of that's the case. I can't wait to have a username back because it's pretty hypocritical that people that are literally named the n-word can roam free but a booby emote gets canned. I still see people with invisible names as a way to hold an advantage and they never got in trouble. Stupidest shit ever."
"Was supposed to be the 1st but Acti fucking fails us YET AGAIN...

Some have made comments that the date was changed to the 15th though."
Isn't there a rumored season 7 dropping on the 11th?
Maybe you'll have to wait for days to get these bundles because the store bundles have a certain amount of time roster.
Bundles cycle. Those bundles were avail recently.
"You can still get them, but it won't advertise the bundle on the operator select screen because the game registers you as having the operator already."
"I�ve had previous people mention that they�re weekly/monthly cycled, so is every Operator's cycle different? Because I can still buy Griggs', Iskra's, and Velikan's bundles with their base skins as of right now. I know Ghost, Mara, and Alex don�t have operator bundles because they were their battle passes main attraction. But Talon and Gaz still don�t have available bundles for me to unlock, even though previously mentioned characters do."
you can probably use the store blueprint button to look for one of the gun blueprints that goes with the gaz/talon operator bundles and then purchase it there. you dont need to wait for it to come back around
"You do now, they changed it when CW released."
"In Gaz�s bundle he has access to Kali Stick blueprints called �Hit Sticks� in my blueprints the Kali Sticks have no blueprints, but at least it was worth a shot"
My buddy got one of these when i was watching him looked like the m60 by the recoil and stuff but it shreds

Probably new meta
What are your specs?
"I have a 7700k, 32gb of ram and a gtx1080, it�s run the game like butter before I just can�t seem to find out why it keeps crashing"
"So I finally grinded out a 3.0w/l and I'm pretty pumped.

I play HC Dom/HQ pretty much exclusively (or HC shoot/ship when available) and it's been a tedious back and forth grind trying to fight enemies as well as picking up the slack from camo grinding teammates to get here (no disrespect, I understand the grind even though I won't partake). I spend pretty much all my time on the objective and don't really care about k/d as you can probably tell with only a 1.08kd. As for spm, not sure why I'm at 55spm because if you divide my score (10,085,030) by my minutes played (23,756) it's comes out to 424.5spm so idk what's up with that.

Anyway, here's to the next grind, getting to 3.5w/l."
"Does the same dumb shit for me. Now I don�t have any space left to download even tho it was all
Downloaded before."
"happened to me over the past couple days and it�s never done this before, i�m on ps aswell"
"This needs way more awareness than it has been getting.

PS5 here and I swear I have re-installed these packs like 6 times over already. I cant keep having it happen so blatantly.

If it happens again I am uninstalling til they fix the fucking shit. It is the most infuriating bug right now."
"If you figure it out, please message me and let me know. I�m dealing with literally the same exact situation currently. So frustrating, and I�m ready to call it quits on cod."
You were hacked  unfortunately. Did you have 2fa enabled
I think I did.
I just want HC ground war tbh
"For real. Just put it in the Quick Play filter, they already have 10v10 and other playlists with varying player counts so clearly it could be integrated. I've also heard of core players who wish they could rotate Ground War in with other game modes for variety's sake, so it'd be a win-win. Can only hope though"
Might be interesting to do a larger CTF game. CTF was my favorite gametype in Soldier of Fortune II with 24 - 32 player servers.
"Speaking of which I wish to god IW would consider replacing Hardcore Headquarters with Hardcore CTF. Fucking nobody likes Headquarters, especially with its broken-ass XP system"
Offensive team would almost always win if they stacked one bomb.
"Either that, or you'd spend half your time waiting for one of the teams to die off because nobody is playing the objective."
"Either demolition or EVEN headquarters, would be ultra fun having everyone in a small room contesting the hq"
Maybe Demolition?
For that I'd just go and play Rush in BF4
What about old school ground war. 2 teams of 10. Normal maps
It's in the game as 10v10.
Nah. It'll be like 12v12 search where everyone dies fast then it quickly just becomes a small lobby
I can't even play Ground war every single match is laggy af
"idea:


have a small part of a GW map have 2 bomb sites. one team are the defenders and the other are the attackers. Unlimited lives for both sides. but when both bomb sites are blown up by the attackers, a larger portion of the map is accesible, with 2 more bombs to blow up. the cycle repeats until 4-ish portions of the map are covered and all bombs have been either defused or the timer has ran out"
That reminds me of Star War Battle Front2 with the game mode Supremacy
What about old school ground war. 2 teams of 10. Normal maps.
"Love it when I�m the thrower, but hate being the recipient!"
Especially at the beginning of the round lmao I just wanna rave quit
What happened to the colours...
He's colorblind...
Must be something wrong lately. I never had server issues like that since I started playing MW but last night I [had a max payne acting server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmfkgpdUSNE).
"Whenever this happens I put on my tracers and watch lazers go brrrrr. 
.yeah servers are sometimes shit"
I've had absolutely zero issues on modern warfare
Good for you
What camo is that
Toronto ultra cdl pack. Not sure you can get it anymore
"Bro, you need to work on your editing.

Thankfully I haven�t encountered server lag lately, although it�s taken 10mins to find a game at 200ms ping and it was the exact lobby I just finished a game in previously."
Still on dual-up 56kbps?
God have mercy on their souls this was disgusting
"Absolutely shit on lmao, cleanup on isle 3"
Bro I would pay to hear that voice chat goddam. It must've been so hyped in that lobby.
"Did you purchase the full Modern Warfare game for $45-60 or did you just get the free Warzone game mode? You have to purchase the full game to play MW multiplayer, coop, and campaign."
yeah i have the full game but someone told me i needed xbox live to play campaign
You need xbox live to play online
yeah i know that but i just wanted to play the campaign
"I'm so glad they took it well, he was only bantering lol."
Wholesome ending? Impossible...
This 100 resurgence is shit they should revert it back to 40
"the cruise missile hitmarker is because of spawn protection, it will show as a small shield next to the hitmarker and it doesn't look like the one for EOD"
"He was on our side of the spawn when I launched it. He for sure didn't just spawn. I know cause I killed him, then he killed me and was in our spawn, I respawned and used the cruise missile I had from earlier in the map. it was on HC so I forgot I had another one."
U are asking for a lot for a game they are mostly done with
"Which is my point. These bugs have been in the game since launch... It just shows how stupid CoD community is regarding how they just butt hump the next FoTM metas.. ""Can't beat'm, Join'm"" mentality... It's sad. Besides, what I'm asking should have been done from the beginning, point blank. it's not asking for a lot, it's asking for what should have already been in place. All I know, I wont be playing another CoD game ever again. Straight garbage community, and garbage dev decisions."
"The cruise missile thing is spawn protection (little white shield) not EOD (a different symbol). You see it a lot on maps like shoot the ship 

Only other thing that blocks cruise missiles are trophy systems"
"HC is an afterthought for the devs and never gets any adjustments. Killstreaks and equipment in general is pretty overpowered for HC to begin with, let alone on FFA where you can just farm up killstreaks by camping. It's almost pointless to run anything but dead silence, and it's overpowered as all hell because you don't have the health to give you time to react to silent ninja people rushing you. The meta for me has become less about what weapon I use and more about constantly having to shoot down killstreaks with rockets or an FMJ LMG and running spotter to find campers and destroy mines/clays.

I know this one bastard in HC FFA who always runs VTOL/support heli/white phos. If you get matched in a game with him he'll just sit in a corner and get enough for a vtol and then the match is pretty much over. That shit is not fun to play against."
"basically, yep. I just know the next game that comes out of Activision won't get any attention from me.. their devs just want money. which is why we have broken mechanics and bugs that have been in the game since day one. but new shop items/modes and ect.."

So popular that you wouldn�t even think a new game had been released. I personally never made the switch and haven�t seen the slightest of signs showing that it�ll die down anytime soon either.
"Now that's a seller, thanks for that"
It's still fairly popular in my part of the world. The only game mode I have trouble finding lobbies for is Ground War.
Still play most days. My mates and I played maybe 5 CW matches and we�ve all come back to MW for multiplayer.
"I get shoot house headquarters 70% of the time, honestly so annoying."
"Same, so annoying"
"27 times and it dropped me in a game in progress with an attack chopper. Thank you so much, game."
[deleted]
Pistols are perfectly usable on shoothouse
It�s people like u server hopping that is causing you to only get shoot house
Yeah but every game I get is basically shoot house headquarters. I cant stand it. Cant blame people for hopping out of a game mode they are sick of.
How does that make any sense it shoulf be the opposite
"Play Hardcore, since it only have TDM, Hardpoint, Domination and KC, People Lobby surfing less than Core (Where there is HQ, Team Defender and Crankced).
Also Hardcore is much much easier for pistol grind. Actually Pistols are very useful in Hardcore."
You are part of the problem
Have you guys seen some of these mastery challenges?  For pistols obsidian: 75 point blank headshots with 3 attachments. In what world is that possible/plausible on any map but shipment
"As part of a long grind: when you sneak up on the shoothouse snipers, or any campers really. But yeah. All of mine have been in hardcore shipment. Just have about 50 more to go with magnum, which is paaaainful. But I use the same set up on all pistols to get these done. 5MW laser, lightweight trigger, stippled grip (for the Sprint to fire) and just walk around like an idiot. I get 3-4 a game like this. Eventually though, you get dropped into just the dumbest lobbies and you can get 7-8 per game til SBMM catches up."
THANK YOU
It�s obsidian. Why would you want it to be easy
"Ummm? Sneak behind ShootHouse mid campers and point blank headshot them? Or you know...OUTGUNING PEOPLE by headshot them? 

Cmon, this is inexcusable. You are basically saying �I suck so bad, can�t outgun people, can�t sneak behind them,...so just give me the easiest map in the game where I spawn behind them�. If you get Shipment then good for you, if not, then complete the challenge like everyone else. It�s suppose to be a challenge, it�s suppose to be difficult, stop trying to use a broken map to mask your own incompetence."
"Will you people ever stop crying about everything ? You begged and they�ve given you shoot the ship 4/6 weeks, now you want shipment only ? You can grind pistols just fine on shoot house unless you�re garbage, I went 67-34 yesterday"
Yeah if you play against bots
"As far as I believe, Avoiding Shoothouse will force you joining shoothouse, server hopping is detected and there are some punishments to it. 

I've been in the same situation too and worse, but believe me that getting shoothouse games will make you get Shipment more frequently. Or you can join some of your friends who get shipment more.

I think shipment is more enjoying regardless the more kills."
Faxx
"Play HC. 

Theres no issue with pistols on shoothouse. You should easily be able to drop 25-30 with pistols as long as youre on the objective. 

40+ if you wanna be a scumbag and only go for kills. The sprint to fire time and ADS speeds are insane and stupid easy to get kills with in HC."
Ryzen 5 3600 is a lot faster than your 2300X so I think you will see much better 1% and 0.1% FPS due to its better single thread performance.
My fav is the EE on station
"Short answer, full price? No. On sale? Yes, most definitely. I�d go with mw19 over cod4 remastered. I personally enjoy mw2019 a million times more than I did with Cold War. I stopped playing Cold War within the first two weeks I had it back in December. I�m like you, I never really enjoyed the black ops games. So this game was perfect for me. I bought it back when I launched and had a blast. You�ll still find lobbies and everything, but you won�t get away from the advertisements of Cold War, and there�s no new content being released for it."
"Is there a history of cod, or mw in particular going on sale? I enjoy the the gun game and face off of CW. Really miss fast paced respawning in warzone."
"Okay... for all launchers try to get them to max level (level 30) this will make everything much easier, to achieve this just play as you would but with a rocket launcher, also try to find shoot house or shipment this helps drastically!

Then for the actual challenges, you will want to shoot every kill streak you see.
Specially go for counter UAVs, Personal radars, UAVs and Vtols, because these kill streaks count as ground based kill streaks and regular kill streaks.

In some occasions if you tell people before the match starts, that you are doing challenges for the launchers they might help.

Specific map strategies:
In shipment, with the (joker) try finding a domination or capture based objetive. Your goal is to stand on either A flag or C flag and shoot to the opposite one. So you basically stand on C and aim to the wall of containers, as close to the A flag, this should count as attacker and defending kills.

Also in shipment, UAVs fly lower so they are easier to shoot down with the strella P and the RPG.

In shoot house, with the (joker) you need to stand on the A flag wall towards the center and aim to the wall on C Flag."
All kill streak/equipment related challenges I did in ground war by sitting in the spawn and using munitions boxes. All kill challenges were done in domination or shoot the ship.
When I sit in the spawn and use the ammo thing it doesn�t give me rpg ammo
"My best advice for you is to play shipment objective modes (hard point is the best as any objective kill counts as a defender and attacker if I�m not mistaken) If you�re done w the killing challenges id suggest grinding the launchers passively. I.e work on other classes AR�s SMG�s LMG�s or whatever else you need, while always carrying the launcher as your secondary (make sure you have spotter and cold blooded on, when I was grinding I remember some streaks didn�t count if I didn�t have spotter on). I�d mainly focus on shooting down CUAV�s, VTOL�s and personal radars as they count as air and ground streaks. But most of all you just need to have patience like a mf, it�s by far the hardest platinum weapon class but my best advice is for you to just unlock the camos passively once you finish all the kill challenges and have it leveled up."
"Basically taking down every UAVs, personal UAVs, counter UAVs, and VTOLs should get you all the killstreak challenges. If you're having trouble with the JOKR, I heard melee kills with it count."
What�s the best gamemode where more people put them up?
I put on double XP and ran around with a riot shield and a launcher meleeing everyone I literally finished the joker in under an hour with getting it leveled up once it was leveled up I finished it in two days
"Play ground war for launchers. Always a ton of Vtols and personal radar, uav and what not."
They stopped the unlocks and reset everyone�s levels for it
How rude
all bundles are on your HD no matter if you have it unlocked or not.
it'd never affect you whatsoever why're you trying to delete it?
Send it to Kylie.

|6|Archipelago Assortment|[Tide Pool](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/151-tide-pool)|

**What's up with the Fatal Freeze?  It's unreleased?**

The Fatal Freeze is a strange one, as it was advertised and promoted by Sony's official Twitter ([here](https://twitter.com/playstation/status/1252681006433394689?lang=en)), even featuring a nifty video, but there were no details on how to unlock it.

Unlike other PS4-exclusive Blueprints, there do not appear to have been any Missions that would have unlocked it.

The game's official website even has placeholder language for the weapon (""showcase weapon traits), instead of detailing the name of the Challenge Mission that would unlock the Fatal Freeze: [https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare/ps4](https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare/ps4)

Indeed, Googling the Fatal Freeze just turns up more posts asking about its lack of availability.

**Which Combat Packs are not yet available to Xbox/PC users?**

* [Season 2](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-whats-in-the-call-of-duty-warzone-playstatio/1100-6474650/) (feat. Track Star, Showstopper, etc.)

* [Season 5](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400317-call-of-duty-warzone-combat-pack) (feat. Footballer, On the Volley, etc.)

* [Season 6](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400488-call-of-duty-warzone-combat-pack) (feat. Jailbird, Slipshod, etc.)

**Wasn't all of this content advertised as being PS4 exclusive?**

Yes, but as a ***timed***\-exclusive - much like Survival mode, which *was released* to Xbox/PC on 10/1/20.  Inconsistently, however, these Missions/Blueprints and Combat Packs were not released to Xbox/PC.  If you need official examples of the timed-exclusive language, here ya go ([1](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/02/10/modern-warfare-season-two-starts-tomorrow-including-new-ps4-exclusive-content/) / [2](https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare/ps4) / [3](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/28/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-season-six-adds-a-fast-travel-subway-system/)).  I can dig up plenty more.

**When did the exclusivity period end?**

Most were advertised to end on 10/1/20.  The exclusivity on some of the Season 6 content was advertised to end on 12/1/20.

**Well those are the earliest dates the content** ***could be*** **made available.  No promise that it would be made available by a certain date.**

Absolutely true.  The whole point of this post is to raise visibility and ask IW/ATI to release this content, as they did with Survival mode, as the exclusivity period has expired months ago.

**If you care so much, just unlock the content on PS4 and then link Xbox/PC to the same account.**

Tried that.  Unfortunately only some of the content displays properly - most likely due to being Warzone loot drops.  Interesting, though, is that ""Lock and Stock"" for Otter did not display properly *until* a couple months ago, so it could be a good sign they're working on it.

**Those calling cards are rewards from past Gunfight Tournaments.  They won't be made available again.**

Not so fast.  Many signs point to past ""exclusive"" content being made available again.  For example, there have been at least [11 leaked bundles](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles?q=battle%20pass%20season) of past Battle Pass content, plus previous BP Operator missions have been displaying, which could indicate their return to the game for those who missed out the first time.  This would suggest they're open-minded to making past ""exclusive"" content available again.  Plus it's been a year since those calling cards were rewards.  Any ""clout"" from having them has since worn off, and, as a general principle, it would be great to make all past content available again somehow.

**Who cares?!  It's just cosmetics.**

Yep, and cosmetics comprised $1.2 billion of the company's $1.9b in revenue in 3 months time:  [https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-made-dollar12b-in-microtransactions-in-the-last-quarter/](https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-made-dollar12b-in-microtransactions-in-the-last-quarter/)   They're obviously important to many people, as the entire value proposition of the Battle Pass, bundles, and all DLC centers around cosmetics.

**When do you think this content will come out?**

Maybe never.  But I'd like to think more optimistically, as I do know ATI/IW listen to our feedback and try to help us out where they can.  Given that Warzone's one-year anniversary is coming up in a few weeks, March 2021 could be a great time to add this content in for everyone!

cc: u/artpeasant u/dmickner u/ashtonisVULCAN_IW"
"MW if you want a refreshing COD experience.
CW if you�re looking for nostalgia."
There is nothing nostalgic about CW unless you find BO4 nostalgic.
"Look at it this way... both games have had the same amount of active users and one of them has been out for more than a year.

If thats not enough, think about the fact that CW has been put on sale multiple times even though it launched a couple months ago, whereas MW has not seen one sale event on the whole game. 

If youre planning on playing mp, get MW.
If youre planning on playing campaign and zombies only, get cw.
If youre planning in playing multiplayer and warzone, get MW."
best answer
I've seen mw on sale quite a few times...
"MW has fantastic MP, good campaign and (IMO) decent spec ops. Spec ops is fun every now and then but can't play often as it's a bit repetitive. If you've played the original MW games I'd say this is a great successor to them MP wise, large variety of modes with 2v2, 6v6, 10v10, and 32v32. They're pretty much all really fun too when you get into them. 

Cold War has a seriously fun campaign, zombies is great, but MP is pretty awful. It really pales in comparison to every other Treyarch MP to the point where it just isn't enjoyable. Whole time playing you just think ""why am I playing this when I could be playing any other COD"". It's little things that all add up to make it one of my least favourite COD MPs. Isn't aggressively bad or anything, just so bland and like I say worse than all others. I have zero motivation to play MP so I just don't.

I don't regret my purchase of CW thanks to the fun I had on the campaign and I really enjoy zombies, but MW is just far better and more replayable

EDIT: to address your points though, I wouldn't say MW is solely better because of more content. Strip away most of the content in the game and at its core it's still a great game. Cold War MP is just fundamentally flawed with the clunky engine and some poor game choices. The scorestreak system feels so arbitrary and you just get streaks handed to you. It doesn't reset on death and has a cool down period after using streaks before you can start to earn them again. Its such an artificial handicap that it takes all the fun out of killstreaks. You could use a chopper gunner then get a 15 killstreak the next life and earn nothing because of the cooldown. I also think the maps are bad, the time to kill is too high, hit detection sucks, and honestly theres a ton more complaints I have 

But MP aside, zombies is really fun. Different to old games because it's less about survival (maps are quite open so training is very easy) and more about upgrading guns and firepower. The fun comes from killing zombies and grinding points/salvage (new currency) to upgrade guns, and less about just trying to survive. There's a new large open world type mode that's very fun too and fits the mechanics perfectly 

Campaign is straight up my favourite COD campaign. It's very short (you could probably beat it in a day) but it's quite inventive and fun. Less shooting people, more sneaking about and making choices. There's dialogue options throughout which help it feel more immersive, and some of the sneaky missions are very cool with different mechanics for each level. Plus a fantastic mission towards the end which I won't spoil.

If you ONLY care about campaign and PVE mode then go CW as it's better in that regard. But MW still has a great campaign, and the MP is really one of the best. Plus the engine is so much nicer. CW feels clunky, MW does not."
Assists counting as kills is kinda lame too
"I am more interested in MP and MW does look better in that regard, however I feel like I sort of missed the boat as it wont get any more updates and just seem it will get more stale cos its 'old'. It just seems not worth the full price any more because its sort of been abandoned and from now on will just bleed players due to the lack of new content.

I rly wish they just stuck to one COD and not make a new one every year."
I like MW for multiplayer and war zone but I like CW for zombies and campaign

"I've heard problems of PS5 deleting packs randomly, especially for people who play on disc. 

I'm on XSX and the console doesn't want to have 2 and 3 downloaded at the same time. Installing one deleted the other. I just have 1 and 2 installed and not 3."
Check to see if they are installed in the manage game add ons screen I believe it's a visual bug when viewing it from in-game.
"No Disc, digital copy transfered from my Ps4."
"This happens to me every couple weeks. No idea how to fix it. I�m literally sitting here now watching 5 different packs get redownloaded. 

Must be a PS5 thing. So frustrating. I was just playing the game 10 minutes ago and restarted my system bc I restarted my router. 

Ridiculous."
"Delete the whole game, and start the transfer again, I would go as far making the game is fully updated on the ps4/Pro before doing the transfer"
"I just had this happen to me on PS5 as well. It�s  annoying but I�m glad I�m not the only one experiencing this.

Edit: I�m on disc free version but running the game off an eternal hdd."
Data cap? Where do you live in a third world country like America?
I live in the middle east
Every now and then it falls apart.
"Activision trying to kill the game? Pretty frustrated with it since a lot of people still love this game, including me :("
"That was so clever!
So interesting!"
"I don't think he meant to, but my eyes are bleeding"
"Thats the Domino rainbow sparkles tracer pack that was released a couple weeks back. It was bugged where only a few players could see it. 

Of course people are still in denial that it released."
"Same deal with the vault packs. People are saying that it's fake, and hasn't been released."
I don't think I ever want to see it again
I saw it and I KNEW instantly that it was the bundle that the helicopter with the rainbow trail affect had. I really want that but I guess I can�t get it :/
"Yes, it's released. Please upvote my last post on this sub where I'm asking to unpin the s1 vault pack post, because A LOT of people including you **are not getting new content.** I always get downvoted by 30% of people that see it and I get hater comments for wanting **to get this issue out of my face**

**Activision, for one tiny moment I want you to take my money. What are you doing with the scissors? Activisioon?**"
"I want the singularity bundle so bad, but the week it was realised I was to busy to play. My guess is that all of these are coming out on March 11."
When did the rainbow bundle release for you?
A couple of cheeky people have a mod for the store to get all the new bundles..
"Exhbitit A. 

These are not modded. Several of the new bundles were already released and are bugged where they only show up for certain people. This happened most recently with the Roze pack. It was the only one that was fixed after people brought it to the attention of the devs. Right after that the same bug was present with the vault packs."
Futives fan I see ;)
Ofc. I honestly think he is one of the best Modern Warfare players. And he�s only getting better!! The last video was great cause he�s getting more comfortable with talking.
"It�s an unreleased bundle, comes with rainbow tracers. Was added in Cold War season 1, hasn�t come out yet."
Do it in whatever order u like and constantly work on launchers while you're doing everything else
Launchers about to be the biggest pain. Especially the JOKR
hardcore will help u level up camos for guns in a hurry
"Ok, take this from someone whos not that good. Biggest tip, do hardcore. Im trash at core, but HC is where i excel. Shipment is also a good option. I didnt take any sensible, methodical route, so with what guns you should do first idk. Im weird in the sense i cant let go of something, so i wasn't good with sniping or rifles, so i kept using them, grinding with them for a few weeks until i got them gold. Rpgs good on any map. Assault rifles easy. Pistols are also easy on shoothouse and shipment HC. Basically i just grinded. Quantity of time over quality of skill. But shipment and shoothouse helped a lot."
"Hardcore, Much quicker kill and easier grind (Not for Snipers tho)
VLK 3.25 optic is the best thing for longshot.
Deployable cover help you a lot with mounted kills and recoil control, specially for longshots.
As soon as u unlock that 0 attachment camo, remove all attachment from ur gun (so you get rid of it first while you get some other camo too).
Mount on the side of deployable cover so you get crouched kills too!
Use ""CAMO"" in ur clan tag, so people know you grinding camo and wont blame or call you camper, sometimes they even help you!
Some of the guns have very high recoil like scar or oden or AK47, putting them in semi auto mode is very effective, cuz you have more control over it, specially for longshot.
Use Damage Range attachment on weaker guns like SMG or M13 cuz the have High ROF but less damage, so u get hitmarker in longrange, but that attachment will help u.

Sometimes using suppressor help you too, specially in quiet maps for 3 kill in one life.

Good luck."
"I've had good luck following Damascus guides I found on YouTube. Just know that for every class of weapon, there may be a mode or map better suited than others, and for pistols, make sure you play hardcore."
"Oh, and another thing. Idk if you knew this or not, but this being my first cod i was able to play online, i didnt. You do not have to level the dlc weapons. Just the guns that came out at launch. Just an fyi."

Yep. This is/was your average MW2 lobbies and lowkey I do miss them"
"Are you in PC or console? 

My gf and I haven't been able to play for weeks... Cause the game won't stop crashing. We're playing on an old Xbox One."
"Fun fact: you sadly cannot split screen on pc


Edit: not so much fun now that I think of it, sadly"
"Also an old xbox one, it's unplayable splitscreen in its current state."
"YES. Same. What the fuck. What platform are you on. I�m on Xbox one 

It�s been since the last CW season"
"Yes xbone too, since the cw update its almost unplayable splitscreen. There is like 50% chance that it will crash."
I'm 4/6 for crashes tonight. Really kills the fun as it takes a few minutes to get back into a game. Then the next one crashes again.
Yes exactly!
You need a really good tv I had this issue on my regular hd but it would run smooth as butter on my new 4k. If your screen has a 60fps cap it will not run and it�ll but shitty on my monitor with 75fps cap but my 4k does HD at 120 so it runs just fine
Ok I'll try it on my 144 hz monitor.
Wait what?
This happened to me on shipment once.
Same. I had to close the game out and restart it.
what happend
At the end of the match it didn't play the final killcam and taking me back to the lobby. I got stuck there and I couldn't move I could only spin around.
Activision sucks
"This seems to be a common issue after people get their accounts back from hackers, they can log in but the account end up being perma-banned for no reason afterwards.

How did you have that much luck even getting to activision support? I was pretty much told I can�t get my account back cause of covid 19 working hours, denied a refund on all my paid items, and when I asked if my account is just gone then, they didn�t even reply.

Still waiting 3 weeks later after sending my account recovery form.

My account was also hacked even whilst I was In the middle of a game of warzone with a friend. Kicked out the game to �your activision account has been unlinked�

12 years of call of duty and that was the help I got from the support team. I�ve moved onto other games that belong to more capable devs and support teams cause I just give up in the end. Hope you  have better luck that I�ve had with them dude!"
"Same with me. I hope they lose there lawsuit and it cost millions. Nothing ever said good about Activision.  No wonder so many people play Fortnite. There customer support is so disgusting, They randomly emailed me about feed back on a game once and I said I would get back to them in about 10 days and did what they do, and didn�t even bother replying."
"I�ve been in contact with them through their live support. Trust me, it�s not worth contacting them that way. You have to wait a minimum 1.5 hours for them to say banned accounts can�t be reviewed. I�ve also sent them a recovery form and an email. No respond from either. I�m just glad that I�ve never bought anything from their in game store. I guess we both need to move on - we don�t even have a choice. Not only is this banning us from Warzone/MW, but from all future Activision titles. What a joke."
Friend of mine wasn�t able to get it to update today so tried deleting everything and then came 1gb short. So even deleted CW. Now he got a update of 86 gb? We have no idea what�s going on because it says online the update is only 240mb
Has this recently been un patched to piss people off and move to cold War due you think? As I swear it's came back this last week as it was patched out some time ago
Has what been un-patched? Quick scoping has always been a thing in modern warfare haha
What gun is that
SPR
I still hate that fucking gun... It's like hit markers galore every single time when I aim for the head...
Gotta use the lapua rounds
"The Sykov along with the RAAL MG, and the CX-9 are yet to be released. There have been in game bundles for soap and various operators with the guns leaked for monthsm"
You can use it in spec ops. I don�t know why after the feedback that spec ops got that they would choose that of all modes but That�s how it is
"Yup, it must be for Cold War/Warzone. Now that they've merged progression of all 3 games, you'll keep getting unlock notifications and green dots (which doesn't even make sense) in main menu from other games while playing MW."
"Nope, it MW and you can use it in Coop Survival, including leveling up it (maxed out few months ago. Fun pistol). Well, you was. Idk how things now with Sukov and CX-9"
Nope and nope. They have bundles yet to be released for MW. Don't talk about what you don't know. It's all been leaked a while ago.
They use a mw attachments tho
They are in the files but not released in MP. Fully useable in spec ops and as  ground loot in warzone but as of rn the only was to use them in MP is to extort a glitch with the weapons drop field upgrade since they are in the files they have a chance to pop up
"Everyone gets it after doing the challenges, some even do it unintentionally."
Just noticed this too it seems that only one can be installed at a time for some reason.
But I have pack and 1 and 2 installed no problem.
Same. First it said 3 was not installed now it says 2 isn�t installed. Wtf?
Same here... has there been a resolution?
Yes a singular resolution!
"same problem, i have all 3 , but keeps saying ones missing..."

Make sure your resolution is set to 100 and the same as your monitor.
"The squad thing is weird, it's got absolutely nothing to do with anything at all, it's purely just an app thing to do those weekly ""most kills"" challenges. It's probably randomised to make ""fair"" squads 

It's completely separate to regiments (Clans in old CODs). I wouldn't worry about it tbh"
Thank you.

"They can't be fixed imo. The audio devs prioritised a cinematic feel and (broken) occlusion. 
Sometimes footsteps can be heard through concrete walls, other times the first footstep you hear is the last sprinting-step the dude takes, before ramming his barrel up your crease. AAA development team btw"
How can all the streamers hear footsteps so well that even I can hear footsteps in their stream?
"For me I had to go with boost high (low works as well) with my cheap corsairs for better footstep audio. I also have my effects at 100% with everything else at 5%. This is the best fix I've found if you'd even call it that. 

I think footstep audio is general is buggy (still don't understand how game got the best audio of the year) and have the suspicion that certain players get buffs and nerfs to in game audio. Some kill cams I'll watch where there's no dead silence and there's someone tactical sprinting and sliding right behind me."
"Exactly, this game for some reason doesn�t make sound of people running at all"

I can�t even be good once how can I be good twice
I read somewhere if you play as two players at the same time using two mouses and foot pedals that you can get better
I can�t even be decent once! How can I be good twice?!
By playing a lot and learning. In multiple of the video cuts he pays attention to one screen then the other. Just practice my friend. Worst comes to worst you get shit on and then get in a bot lobby
did u know multiple mouse = mice
"Hey! I�ve been working on this idea for awhile now & compiled a few clips of some of my gameplay from the past month. This is possible by using a mouse for each hand and foot pedals for each foot. If anyone�s interested, I can explain it in-depth in the future or make a video about it too."
"That's a pretty cool idea. Can you post the link to your youtube channel?

(Edit) Nevermind, I found you:
https://youtu.be/XEv_PjMGu3E"
I�d be curious. Definitely wanna know how those foot pedals are laid out.
"yes we are interested in the in-depth. i�d say even non gamers would be interested. this is a fascinating expression of what the brain/hands can accomplish! everyone is really interested in this, just trying to encourage more traction to your chancel, anyway good luck!"

All I gotta say. Just deal with it. No way around it
"If you're getting dunked on by Rytecs, thats on you lol."
"Modern Warfare is just a giant game of rock paper scissors.

Dragon breath shotgun? Keep your distance.

Rytec explosive rounds? Get up nice and close and move around. Explosive rounds travel slow and the ADS on the rytec is atrocious, especially with explosive rounds."
ig fair enough
[deleted]
I dont think thats what he's worried about
What does gore have to do with this post bro
"rytec explosive ammo has terrible bullet velocity. getting kills with that thing is fun as fuck tho, so if you somehow get killed by those things then youre not ducking quick enough"
I noticed this as well. My guess is that they lowered XP in MW to try to push people into playing/buying Cold War.
"Thats disgusting, wtf"
"I've had that as well.    I've been going through battlepass tiers like a flippin snail.   Every game is like 1/13th of the tier.      However on cold war it's fast af.   
I regret getting cold war when it was first released but damn they favour XP af.     

And the fact that the players favourite playlist have been up for agessss(nuketown 24/7)- comparing to shoot the ship"

There were some in Battlepasses. Not sure there's any bundles with it and those would be the ones found in the store.
"There was only one in season 6.  The SPR was in the battle pass during that time, and no other blueprint has been put out yet."
:/ that sucks just started playing recently oh well! Haha
Have you tried it through the companion app?

Delete texture pack 2 and reinstall
"Im going through the same thing, I dont even want the high texture pack but the game isnt letting me download the multiplayer packs..."
"Delete it and reinstall, you can find the packs in settings"
I�ve tried that already and when I uninstall and reinstall texture pack 2 it says I need to install texture pack 3 even though it�s been uninstalled and reinstalled already
Games been running like sgit since i installed it. Wtf
thats cool as hell
Appreciate that buddy
Ahh... this has happened to me numerous times. The only way to fix it is too re-download it.
Someone lmk if there is the new weapons added in
no
I'm on One X. Same thing. I can't notice a difference anyway tbh.
Check the game addons in the menu on the xbox itself. I'm pretty sure its visually bugged when viewing it within the game.
In the game add ons all texture packs are installed it�s just within the game it show texture pack 2 as not installed
You may to to delete all data for game and reinstall I�ve had to do it a few times now
Same thing happens on my one X
"Same on SX. I just have 1 and 2 installed, ignoring 3"
Nah just take away the flinch so my guy doesn't look straight up in the air as soon as i get punched. It exists for literally no reason other than to help bad players get kills.
What?
"You know like they have in minecraft when you have a sword and you hold left trigger, knife arms are out the dual weapons hold them infront like an x to take less damage from other melee attacks."
"Devs of various FPS games have toyed with the idea of a partial shield (a mini riot shield with a smaller surface area coverage). Something to consider, I agree."
That would just break melee/takedowns because everyone would counter. Might as well flip a coin.
Maybe just remove melee altogether
"Ebr mk2 kar 98
Dragonov ax50 hdr"
"Ax-50, Dragunov and HDR but you also need marksman rifles for platinum"
"You need to get the EBR, the Kar98, the MK2, the HDR, the AX-50 and the Dragunov gold. Basically you need to do all guns that were in the game at launch"
Thank you all... I�m glad I don�t have to waste time on the Rytec!

This will help with your grind https://damascus.now.sh

That's rust baby!
I feel like anybody who names the Cod accnt after Vloger or Porn Stars are the top tier worse call of duty players of all time
Looks like you made them delete their account
Finished w the mg34 anti aircraft gun :)
I still got a long ways to go to get damascus. So far I got 4 or 5 weapons gold.
"Keep on grinding and you'll get there :).
You should rn ttyna get JOKR maybe cuz there is shipment"
I have 0 but I switch mid smgs to riot shield since shoot the ship might be leaving and riot shield I almost have gold and then I�m doing knife
"Yeea, i was grinding lmg and jokr together"
When did they release this on PS3?
Congrats! Got myself a platinum on Launchers today. I can�t even imagine your struggle for Damascus!
"Nice job dude. I�m grinding too, currently have play for all smgs and now working on rifles"
Congrats man! It really was one game left lol
Running around shooting the sky like a maniac is the last required step...
This LMG is so underused. Rightfully so though its not very good outside of hardcore that ive noticed. But its still one of my favourite LMGs to use.
"I�m proud of you soldier, I�m grinding for it and I need 2 pistols 4 ars, all the rpgs and I have it. Stuck on leveling up weapons tho lmao going for the rpg now"

would have been clean if you didn't melee after every kill
I hit the joystick too hard mbd
why do you melee after every kill
"If you ask me, the issue is that spec ops is one of the very few data packs you can actually delete while still being able to play Multiplayer and Warzone. I tried playing at some point, specially because you supposedly can continue the campaign story there. But being so random and, if you ask me, difficult while also being something you can let go and make room on HDD made it so people stopped playing it. I actually think it's fun."
They should have the option to start SpecOp without any teammates. Theres nothing wrong in starting alone since late entering will just parachute you in.
"I could never find a match last I played only lobbies of 2 or 3 people who would leave after 2 mins of waiting, Honestly I wish Infinity Ward would of just had a quick match option for spec ops for people that didn't care which mission they played.  


Shame too, I actually had a blast playing it, and it was a fun way to level up weapons outside of PVP."
I played about 3 spec ops missions last week. Each took me maybe 3 to 4 min to find teammates.
"Damn, I�ve been trying for ages and only usually find one other person who backs out"
On ps4 u can find specops lobbies faster with crossplay ON.

"Hey, a fellow Grandmaster grinder. I'm currently at 265/306. The first time I remember seeing the progress bar appear was around 40/306 ish. Also, I had Damascus for all base guns and DLC guns before I started. I think it is really important to get all guns unlocked first, because the skill challenges are all +1 each and are a lot quicker than getting 2500 kills / 1000 headshots (especially with stuff like the crossbow). You don't need to complete all 6 challenges for each gun, just complete enough to reach that 306 threshold. Remember to always have a launcher on your back, because you need 1000 destroys with each for their Damascus titles, if you choose to do those"
Do you have enough weapons damascus to go for it cause you need that.
"I have damascus yes, do you need to get every gun gold then for it to appear?"

Set texture resolution to normal should solve the issue
I wish I could but I can't get that far it crashes on the loading up bit.
I have uploaded a video of my issue.
"Try resetting your Modern Warfare settings files.

Located the 'Modern Warfare' folder in your Documents folder and delete everything inside it. Once you click play on the game, it will prompt you to run the game in Safe mode. Select 'yes'. Once the game loads (if it doesn't crash), tweak your settings back to your preferred values.

Come back here if it does not work, I can keep helping!

p.s. Does this issue also pertain in other games? (other than Cold War and Modern Warfare)"
"Hi,

Thanks for this detailed response. I have a backup copy of modern warfare and cold war. I just moved over Modern Warfare and am currently updating it (38GB to do), will be done in 10 mins. No other games are fine just cold war and modern warfare are having issues. I will finish this update and see if it works, if not I will respond here again for further assistance. 

Thanks,"
"OK update done and still crashes, also did your above steps and still to no avail."
Downgrade to the previous version of Windows 10. This fixed it for me so i just skipped a beta build and it's still working.
How will I go about a downgrade?
\^which Version are we talking about?
"Exact same problem for me, i have tried everything but i couldnt find a solution that worked"
Try the one in the edit it may work
"Make a backup of your user folder (documents\call of duty modern warfare), delete it and restart your game"
Thanks for this however I have done these steps and still won't work.
I really enjoy MW. Mostly because of aesthetic. Also matchmaking looks not this fcd up like in Cold War.
"Hmm, I like both games, Though I lean towards Cold War more personally, I think I like the slower TTK.

In terms of pacing It's pretty much a tie for me. Both games have there mad men who've done a line of coke and main lined a triple espresso before getting on, that's just call of duty for ya."
"I say yes. I don�t know how much you care about individual aspects of certain games, but I think you will enjoy MW more than CW. Don�t get me wrong, MW can really fast sometimes, but I think it�s an amazing game. 

If you�re on the fence, try Warzone. It�s free and you have to install it anyway if you�re buying MW, because they are basically the same game, complimenting each other. 

Also don�t worry about player numbers. They will be high enough till next MW sequel, which is 2022. Me and my friends been playing MW on almost daily basis."
"Servers are Activision's. They're crap like all others, I guess. xD

The feedback I keep seeing is that people keep playing MW MP. CW is only good for Zombies anyway.

The fact that you're still paying full price for MW after another COD came out says a lot, I guess."
Yeah what can you do tho sadly
Not worth. I wasted so much money on that game and warzone. Activision only cares about money. Not fixing or improving their games.
Holy shit that was nice.
That was clean as hell
This just reminded me i need to take a shower. Clean
I can feel the anger from the enemy team
That's a Fancy AX50
Now that was smooth
What do even say if you�re the other team watching the re-play
I wouldn�t even be mad. I always enjoy seeing nice no-scopes.
Now that was an instant RQ from two players
That..that was nice...
Never in my dreams...

"You can't, he's using an exploit in the games networking code. Unless a third party patches it, it'll be a consistent problem.

I know there's a third party multiplayer mod for the game that fixes things like that but i can't share it here. You could find it and find out if they patched it, maybe they could provide a patch to use on the official version, I'm not sure. Would have to ask and find out."

whyd it get taken down
Holy shit. This is the first time I've noticed a huge mountain on the horizon!
Lol wtf
just a random teammate in plunder :)
If anything theyy should reduce the number of studios working on titles. Now there is warzone attached to the games I wouldn't have a problem with cod releasing a good non buggy game every 2 years instead of buggy games every year with one good game every 5
"Hmm, yeah have to agree on that. They should have like a 1/2 year break. So no rushing, take their time with the game development and polish it to the max."
They�re currently shitting the bed with MW/WZ and you want them to have their own title?
It's a rocky start but they can do better.
"The same of MW Remastered? Please, mercy."
The same? What do mean?
"I don�t think it�s our position to let them do anything *but* if it were up to me I�d stick with what we�ve got; IW for attention to detail, creating a believable atmosphere and for the more tacticool geardos amongst us, Treyarch for the goofy more cartoony designs and Sledgehammer falling somewhere between the two.  I don�t really see what Raven can bring to the table as a main developer, their handling of the CW integration to Warzone has been rough (granted there are a million reasons I can think of but that gets into the what ifs, which is a never ending hole) so with that in mind I�d prefer to stick with what we�ve got.  if Raven put out a standalone Call of Duty title that wasn�t linked to any greater universe like Sledgehammer�s WWII then I�d certainly give it the time of day, just as it stands at the moment I�m not particularly confident that they would find their own path rather than create Black Ops Cold War 1.5 or Modern Warfare 1.5"
"Raven actually do a lot of work on each of the games that release each year. Raven is usually in charge of post launch multiplayer support.

Taking them away would probably be noticeable on the games they would have otherwise worked on. I say leave them as they are."
I just want Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 (2022)
Haha soon mate soon and hope they remastered MW3 too

"I mean yeah but it's a rocky start but maybe they'll do better if IF they were making their own CoD title. Who knows, you know."
"I�ve done the Damascus grind. I saw it as an added bonus on experiencing all the original guns and getting use to them. I think it made me slightly better at Warzone tbh

The only pain I found was the shield and a few of the RPG tasks. Those were a pain, rest of it I found kinda fun."
"Nope, for me personally.. it wasn't worth the effort"
"I�m on the Damascus grind and with shoot the ship it speed it up but the launchers, my god are they slow levelling up. Taken 3 days of shoot the ship to do the first launcher"
"tip for the launchers , you wanna be doing them alongside another gun , the launchers will take a long time and just focus on another weapon class and if you see a uav or personal radar and stuff pull out your launcher"
"Best advice for launchers is to always keep one as a secondary and focus on one at a time.  Before i tried unlocking the skins, i leveled them up fully in Plunder.  When they are fully leveled up, a lot of the kill streak skins stack with the various skins.  It makes the grind a bit bearable.  Attacker/Defender kills are good in Hardpoint and Domination.  Def recommend Hardcore mode for those two games.  Best of luck!"
"I still need LMG�s, Launchers, & riot shield. Should I go for Damascus ?"
Having all the guns leveled up and a nice camo to cover the ugly guns is nice
"Dang that sucks. The good news is you'll make back 1300 cod points if you grind out the whole battlepass. The grind is going to suck especially since you wont be able to use any of the rewards, but atleast youll have some extra points for your trouble"
"No, there's a lot of people who went through this last season and you're the second I saw for season 2. There's probably a lot more. You can get most of the content in Warzone but yeah, this is mostly CW. I don't own CW and bought the BP but I did so knowingly because I play mostly WZ these days.

Yes, the cash grab is real, though."
I admit it it's my fault for not reading it more thoroughly but I still feel cheated.
My guy it�s season 2 already it was the same thing with season 1 stop complaining about it and it clearly says warzone and Cold War
"Maybe add to this the fact how you're playing game that's over a year old within a franchise releasing games yearly. Also this game you are playing already had its own 6 seasons that ypu seem to be aware you misded. Also the battle pass is named black ops/warzone battlepass in several places, as opposed to the modern warfare battle pass we already had 6 times and isn't there anymore for a reson(new title, old stops being supported maybe?). 


Don't get me wrong but it's not them, it's you."
I understand but it doesn't make sense being able to grind it by playing a game that you say has it's 6 seasons already. It's my bad and thankfully it's convenient since I can play it and maybe when I buy cold war ill have it unlocked. I've never experienced having multiple games in a game so I had no clue what's cold war and what's modern warfare hence the mistake.
as val is incredibly OP
I'd take off the incredibly. IMO it's harder to use than the other ARs. Sure it's powerful af but it's not good for noobs
"It's not that bad, its just really good as a duelist's weapon.  


Also: shotguns/quickscoping can beat the AS VAL easily enough. The AS VAL might have a fast TTK, but there's no faster TTK than ***instant***."
"I'd say AS-VAL and CR-56 Amax as strong meta, and then the MP5 and SPR/Kar are also fairly common."
"Imo, the balance is pretty good right now. The AS VAL and AMAX certainly have an ""edge"" but nothing that can't be outplayed.  


Most weapons are pretty viable, but these are the favorites I see most frequently: GRAU, M13, M4, Kilo, AMAX, AS VAL, MP5, MP7, KAR98, SPR. Obviously the 5.56 ARs are very familiar and comfortable, so alot of folks still default to them."
Dragunov is pretty broken and I get killed by at least one every game
"Try G2A, Kinguin or key4you"
Thank you!
Well i just googled Obsidian and most of the results come up black. No idea what you have there.
That says rainbow obsidian.. try black obsidian no?
I think that got patched
"Damn I hope not, it'd sum up my timing pretty easily."
Wait it�s been added into multiplayer ?
"Not yet, but every tutorial on YouTube says the same thing.

As far as I know the only way to actually use it in multiplayer is through the weapons drop. Though there's a small chance of finding it"
They patched the weapon unlock and xp for the new weapons i tried it in survival
That�s weird. They patched the unlock for the RAAL and CX-9 but I was able to unlock the Cykov yesterday. But you�re right about the XP thing.
"I tried to complete the challenge in HC MP, Boots on the Ground, and Survival.  Nothing I did worked."
"Agreed, I got CW for the free week to get the outbreak rewards, completed that and said I'd try the multiplayer and it felt like I went back in time as far as gameplay mechanics.. absolute piss!"
CW is total shite.  I'm back to MW and Warzone again.
"Dude, this is exactly what I�ve been telling people when they ask if they should buy the game
The game feels like a chore to play. Most of the players I�ve talked to agree that we�re done after dark matter ultra, and honestly I don�t even know if I�m going to do it. It�s so much worse of a grind than Damascus because several challenges rely on rng and luck.

It�s a horrible game, and it would be a huge mistake for activision to take cod in this direction"
"idk man, I enjoy CW. Though if MW2019 ever gets discounted again I'll probably get it since I liked it during the free weekends it had."
"Thats exactly why I hate Treyarch
Infinity Ward put passion into MW2019
Cold War, BO3 and BO4 are just hot trash"
"BO3 is a good game, people only get mad at it because its a 3d movement game and the campaign was confusing"
[deleted]
"I routinely play both and within a game or two you get back into it, Cold War is frustrating to level up guns and turn them into beams I do agree but the health on Cw is higher than mw so you shouldn�t be dying quicker and it�s either your internet or your aim if you�re losing gun fights if you�re shooting at them first!"
"I play it for zombies, and I�d say it�s a suitable vehicle for that except the servers are terrible.

But the actual multiplayer is really bad. Everything is so stiff whereas Modern Warfare feels super fluid and smooth

The weapons all feel the same, the attachments are bad, they look bad with attachments, and the reload animations are stiff.

One plus for Cold War is the variety in the settings for maps, but they�re laid out so terribly, and they�ve quickly abandoned the 80�s aesthetic in favor of recycling old maps with no visible change."
"For the zombies part I don�t think that you should be comparing it to the one from cod mobile, you see �Outbreak� is a entirely new gamemode and is open world so it�d be entirely different from your regular zombies experience, if you want the good ol zombies experience in Cold War you�d have to buy the game or wait for Activision to drop a free access week possibly when DLC 4 comes out"
"I've been playing a fair bit of cold war (I think ive got about 15 hours, I know that's not a lot, but I only really picked it up for the 2xp last week, to try to grind the battle pass and work on dmu and dark aether), and there are some aspects I like more than mw, there's a lot less camping in cold war (bear in mind I play mostly hardcore nuketown, face off, and the raid/crossroads playlist when it was there), the sound is awful, and the knife swings a bit too slow for me, but other than that, I would say it's a pretty solid game (not saying the game is up to expectations, but it's still a relatively good game). I'm planning on getting to at least damascus (3 ars, 2 lmgs and 3 snipers/mksmn rifles left to go) or maybe try to get it on all my guns (except the crossbow, fuck the crossbow) and then move to cold war. But I feel like shit talking Cold war is like Shit talking the star wars sequels, they weren't that bad, they just didn't compare to the originals. 

tldr: cold war not all bad, but still pretty eeh"
The higher ttk was the issue for me. Higher ttk doesn't really solve the camping issue and it messed up my timing from MW.
"I deleted it after a couple hours. It really is an awful game. The perks are mostly useless which isn't surprising for a black ops game. The few perks that are good are the only ones that anyone uses. Full autos stomp absolutely everything at any distance. I tried using the m16 and DMR, got smoked at super long ranges before i could fire a second shot by some guy with a stoner or xm4. The spawns are somehow worse than modern warfare. They seem completely random regardless of player positions. The game just doesn't flow well compared to previous games."
"my friend says he can't tell the difference and just that there's less camping in blackops. to me everything feels too different, too arcadey and clunky."
I can't believe Activision is killing MW for a game as shitty as CW. What an absolute fucking waste.
"This is just thr cycle of cod games. New one comes out and we say 'last year game was better' 

2021 release will happen and we will say its not as good as cold war.


Just play what you enjoy. Don't understand why you need to pick a side."
"Except some of us actually do enjoy a lot of the COD entries. I, for one, always enjoyed both infinity warfare and treyarchs additions into the franchise. But Cold War by far is the worst COD/multiplayer experience I think I�ve played.

This isn�t about the �cod cycle.�
This game was clearly rushed, bugged, and janky when it does work; it isn�t anything other than a cash grab and I really hope activision doesn�t feel incentivized to let the rest of the franchise fall into this mediocrity."
"Modern warfare is quite clearly the best cod game in terms of quality, by a long distance."
"Nah, this is a literal step backwards."
Man this sub is like someone who won't shut up about their ex. Give it a rest already.
"I mean if your ex lived in your house and showed up in your room everyday half naked going ""why won't you just sleep with me I was only a bit abusive?"" You might feel the same way. Cold war is advertised in modern warfares menus."
The Milano is the best gun for hipfiring.
I completely agree I pre-ordered the game and I paid 60 bucks bc I thought it looked like a good game but I was wrong. The machete just came out and I was gonna grind for it but 3/15 of the way in I lost my mind.
"MW2019 would have blown every other CoD out of the water, IMO, if it had Gung-Ho and Dead Silence perks and Ghost only worked when you're moving around."

Same
Yeah this is the only error I get and I tried 2 different system 5950x and 10900k both 32g but different ram and the same 3090. Yet I still got the error.
I haven�t had it in a couple nights. Praying they�ve fixed whatever the issue is.
"Same, do you have a 3080 or 3090?"
I don�t. And I�ve been getting like 3-4 different numbered dev errors actually
"Same same - deleted [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) cache as well, didn't help."
Quality content here
"So there are several things here:

Cross play, if enabled will optimize by location not by network. That�s just the nature of the beast.

1. Despite millions of players, you are still restricted by region. Just cuz millions are online doesn�t mean you�ll get to play them.

2. Algorithms abuse, often mistaken as SBMM. This is the game putting players who pay money on better teams or players who don�t pay or stream in with weaker teams. To foot the average.

3. Warzone counts as the MW player base, so even though millions are on, that�s counting people playing warzone...so they get to double dip their numbers and make the game look more popular than it is.

4. Game modes. Some games modes just aren�t that popular.

5. Connectivity issues, general stuff. If your ping is at a certain rate you�ll be put in with those of equal rate to take stress off the server"

no competition
Ronin look up Tu Lam
"lerch.  ronin too edgy, all show"

"I have questions for you, why in the lords name are you running a tactical insertion in S&D?

I have never seen someone run the mini map like you. You have it set to square, that's good, but why did you change it do where it doesn't rotate with you?"
"I got some answers for you! My teammates also gave me shit about the tact insertion on S&D and to be completely honest, I have a Kar quick scope class I use for S&D and an SPR that I use on ground war. Decide to use the SPR a few times and just never changed it(but I plan to now that I like it more than the Kar).

As for the radar, I�m experimenting. I�ve always had it to other way but I wanted to try this out. I was gonna give it a week but it�s only been a couple days and it�s driving me crazy"
"what do y'all mean, they're carrying guns, that's toxic"
SPR makes me wanna kill myself
"Pretty good, good use of the filthy frank, pretty accurate"

"Maybe... Maybe its to be slightly different so it looks interesting... So to not be called out at being lazy at animation, and upping the viewmodel game.

I dunno, i'm not genius like you guys."
ha lmao
The magwell is at an angle so you would have to put your hand at a weird angle to reload like an AK would
And the an94 is basically a collet AK so one must show off in any way
"yea, the an94's firing system is the reason why the mag is canted, but seriously, why would you twist your arm like that"
"It's so weird since its canted that kind of reload requires more arm twisting than not.

I went into bots and reload to record kill cam of me dying while reload and it looks so weird."
yup
"its stylised, there are already multiple other ak-magwell style guns where you rack the mag into the receiver. the animators probably wanted to make it look unique because its a rare gun in reality"
"yup

its ""forgotten"" according to many sources

and its also really expensive"
"because it looks really cool, dont look into it too much"
true dat
"They also try to make as many things seem different on each gun so you don't catch on that it's extremely similar to the other ARs.

They introduce a new AR that shoots the same ammo but has a .105 faster reload and a .027 slower fire rate and call it new."
k
"Reload mechanism is on the right side. If you reload mag normally, you would have to move your hand under the mag before you can reload.

Now when your hand is on the right side of the mag ""upside down"", not only you can instantly have your hand on the right side of the gun and reload but your palm is pointing directly towards the reloading mechanism making it the fastest way possible to reload this gun if done with the left hand.

It's probably only 0.2 - 0.5 secs faster but when your life depends on it, you have to do it efficiently."
"dude chill!!!

its a video game, not india-china  war

but on the other hand, its good knowing these things"
"It�s a cantered mag to allow for the Hyper Burst.

Infact one of the reasons it was never really adopted was Becuase of the reload requiring a new training style...that and it�s ludacrisly expensive price tag.

At the height of cost 1 AN-94 was worth 16 AK-75�s with each having three magazines"
"yup

the an94's canted mag is designed to accommodate its firing system

damn you know your guns

dont ask bout me, im just 14 yo and go with what wikipedia tells me lmao

but i do know a bit bout guns, how they fire, ammo types, types of bullets, etc"
"Most of the idiots here are saying it�s because the mag is canted, when in fact, it can be reloaded like the normal AK just by slightly tilting the AN94 to a slight side."
"idiots is a bit strong, but yeah youre right

but some are even discussing why its canted"
"God, that looks painful... twisting your arm like that."
"yup

that too each time you reload

and in fps, reloading after firing a single bullet is the law lmao"
Exotic animation for exotic weapon
"its pretty damn good in mw and warzone

especially the 2 rnd burst when you toggle fire mode

but i personally feel the hyperburst should be more like 5-6 rounds, instead of 2

but then, that would be unrealistic in a rather too realistic game"
Why? Because yes.
That's how you'd reload if your magazines were kept upside down in their pouches.
lmao
Which ones are you confused about?
All the ones that involve different types of kill streaks idk what the difference between most of them are
The killstreak ones are basically the same. Destroy any killstreak and you are getting the challenge except for the aerial killstreak (obviously only works for aerial killstreaks). I'm currently working on my launchers so I'm trying to destroy every killstreak I can and it unlocks camos for all of the killstreak challenges.
you gotta love cod chat
https://youtu.be/raVaNiWe7EY
you mean the little rubberduck?
"No it wasn�t the rubber duck, it looked like a normal duck, it was colored like a Mallard duck. I downloaded the free bundle and equipped it, the charm wouldn�t render in the weapons loadout menu so I restarted the game and it was gone"
I have the same charm I think? Its only useable on Cold War guns.
"Ahh this would make sense as I don�t own CW, thanks!"
That charm was in the CW season one BP so you can use it in WZ & CW but not MW.
LMAO that freeze at the end with another guy jumping in
"i knowww, i died to him cause i was tryna clip that first kill"
"My first clip upload
Enjoy"
"Someone: *kills themselves*
This dude: ***Wholesome 100***"
"That's certainly a bro move but sorry, nothing I would do. I wouldn't even recognize the moment I allegedly took your execution, as when I see an enemy I shoot to kill (or try, I'm no good) and move on fast  


So it was fun to see, thank you for the laugh"
"Hey I�m here to make people laugh dude, glad you enjoyed it!"
"incredible, despite the other player using the rook skin"
If I had my old HD not die I'd still have a clip of the enemy checking out me executing his teammate then killing me after on shipment 10v10. But more often than not homies are some bitchass players that intentionally steal it. I had a guy watch me half execute then steal the kill and just walks away like it never happened.
"The updates are getting out of control. Had to wait like an hour for the copying thing on ps5 so idk why copying took so long it has an insane ssd. I�m on pc but my wife plays ps5 and so it�s just me waiting for her and then I get an update kicks me from the game. I download it then have to reinstall my shaders and my graphic settings get all jumbled around. 

Then once I�m ready to get into a game I start getting the orange squares the second I get into the game even with a 20ms ping and 0% packet loss I still somehow get lag spikes. It�s a mess but honestly it�s the best gun experience I have played (Warzone) I�m waiting to see if battlefield 6 is gonna be any good cause 5 and 4 were not as good at BF3 in my opinion but MW is the best Cod since MW2 also my opinion. It needs work though for sure."
"I�d argue that BF4 were better than BF3 tho. Certainly not the maps, not the campers,...but the gunplay was overall better. Don�t get me wrong, when BF4 was released I hated it with a passion, the bugs/glitches, the differences, how it was not BF3. But then EA pulled the plug on BF3 in my region, forcing me to play BF4. Then they perfected BF4, and I had such an enjoyable time playing it. If they ever decide to remasted BF3, it should be BF4 with a BF3 theme."
"the entire problem with this game is all based around warzone and the integration of multiple CODs into one game. Is it so difficult to have warzone as it�s own application? Or keep cold war guns in cold war? Not all of us are sweating warzone dubs day in and day out, i paid $60 to play modern warfare. yet when i start the app the game title isn�t even displayed"
Also noticed for anyone that bought the CDL packs the camos work in multiplayer as well
Damn that�s cool! Only a matter of time before someone�s game glitches out and they sneak a CW weapon into MW multiplayer
"This is great news!

There's really no logical reason for stuff like Stickers and Charms to be locked only to certain games tbh."
For some reason it also shows you can equip charms but they don�t show
I said that but they don�t wanna listen lol
They show them but you can�t use them
No I can use them. Even see them in MW multiplayer matches

A well known cheat just updated and was made available today. The game is unplayable now.
"That vtol be like:
""Parry this you fucking casual"""
"You can�t. Even if you uninstall everything that is not MP, the game still keep Warzone in the Multiplayer pack since Activision stupidly decided that Warzone counts as MP. You would still end up with a 130GB game. You can only free up the Campaign and Co-Op. Fuck Warzone in it brown ass, the moment they allow Warzone to be seperated from MP Imma be the first one to do it. I have a 5TB hdd but I can�t stand unneeded stuffs lying around in my drive."
Well I have only one option then bro....I'm sticking with titanfall 2 lol
Ditch only the packs with non multiplayer names on them
I have the game uninstall right so just cancel out those packs? And how much space does it take altogether?
WeirdChamp
Begone thot
tbh the ebr is the only weapon i really hated during that grind. maybe the carbine too and its ENDLESS HITMARKERS.
HC is the perfect mode for both guns
Nice
ebr is doing my head in :/
Dragunov last? Its the first sniper i did. I got the pain out of the way first
Crossbow is the worst for me
"nice

dragunov lmao"
I honestly enjoyed snipers to platinum a lot more than I thought I would. I did it all on shoot the ship but it only took me 3 nights of a few hours a night to get the snipers and marksman to platinum. I expected to be there for twice as long since I never snipe.
You were involved in a motor vehicle collision.
You're not wrong....
Nice
Oh I could only imagine what that feeling is like

"Destiny is great and all this is a CoD sub tho, with a question related to weapon swapping, not spamming jump bound to scroll."
I�d say it�s above average
I just started getting lag so bad I end up spectating in multiplayer on my Xbox Series X. It's like when you spectate after dying in Warzone...
"PC player here, even for me, the lag is insane!"
eu?
No US. But I�m assuming latency is going to be bad. What�s your activision id? We can give it a try if you�re down
Dragonov long shots are a pain lol (I'm assuming that's what you're trying to do)
Why would it not?
"all weapons benefit from SP by reducing the shots to kill by one or increasing thr ine shot area for snipers and such, but the ak may not be a great weapon for it because it increases recoil by a lot"
F
anytime I see someone take a bullet for someone else all I hear is �MR PRESIDENT GET DOWN�
"Damn I was about to comment that, but hey you beat me to it so job"
What�s the point in continuing or playing after that?
We lost this one!!

"Looking at the picture of it, it looks like its this, I couldn't find anything on Google. I hope someone else has the definite correct answer: 

VLK 105mm Sova Barrel /// 
Variable Zoom Scope /// 
Either VLK Strelok or VLK Vintach, the color is messing with me right now /// 
Bipod /// 
SPP 10-R Mags  

Edit: formatting on my phone is bad, sorry."
Thanks man ! I couldn�t find anything on google either - this helps ! See you on the battlefield:)
I think it has the stock barrel. For sure it has the 10-R Mags// Bipod// Thermal to Red dot Scope// Lazer// and either some kind of Stock or Grip I can�t tell. I don�t have the names because I�m still unlocking
It slaps because the AS VAL is broken it�s a minimum 3 bullet kill with a fire rate of 930rpm there�s a reason it�s so overused.
Big booty
"As a self proclaimed OG cod player, I don�t vehemently hate MW.  If they could just get rid of SBMM and those stupid doors, it would be an alright game.  I wish there were a few more standard 3 lane maps, but I can work with what�s currently in the game."
"Gave cw a 2nd chance the other day, got uninstalled after 5 matches."
"Played during both free events and really tried to like CW, but I just can't. 

Hitreg is absolutely atrocious on KB&M plus some of the strongest aim assist console has ever had makes the game really unenjoyable for me. 

Thats not to mention the awful graphics, animations, and movement.  
Of course you're entitled to your opinion tho"
"One of the things I didn't like is that they put the minimap back in on mw. I wish I could have played the game the way the devs originally planned it. It just feels weird to have the minimap there when there's no red dots on it and have the red dots on the compass. I often find myself looking at the minimap while I should be looking on the compass for ennemy shooting. It makes no sense to do both. Just do one or the other. I know my opinion is probably not very popular, but I still feel that way. Would've made things different."
[deleted]
Lol. Been hearing this since mw 2. It�s in the game. Find a work around.
It�s like the IT guy quit and they have the mailroom guy fixing shit
Yuuuup
"your gpu isn't being used, same thing happened to a friend after an update. nothing we tried worked"
The game is a disaster. MW is mostly fine but warzone is unplayable about every other match.
I no longer play warzone because of this shit.... zits unplayable. Every game I have runs smooth but this laggy pos.
"as I saw on another person�s post...

�*If I fucked up this many times, I would�ve been fired*�"
"Ground war is like this as well, no stop lag and it keeps putting you back into the same game"
"just had a match with a few guys experiencing this. altogether, we had fun and the entire enemy team left so we won by forfeit"
I would also like to know.
Is that from a new Cold War anime bundle perhaps?
It is. The Millano got a tracer bundle today that has that emblem in it
Aaa i want that now
"I totally don�t mind helping, if you have any questions you can ask me, as for as seeing people go I utilize 3D Audio a lot and I look for Any movement. Trees etc don�t sway or move so don�t doors they always spawn shut. So you can tell a lot just from environmental changes (I�m Mostly Blind Too Btw) gunfight make sure to always push/Watch a lane helps a lot rather then running around aimlessly Which I see a lot of randoms do"
Do u still play? We should 1V1 sometime
Depends what you play on; what do you play on?
"PC, Keyboard Mouse"
"No it's not cheating. Activision allows it. Now your moral dilemma is your own stance. My best friends has a moral complex to he refuses to follow meta. During the DMR days he refused to touch it. Because if he won on his own skill he felt better about it.

Point is everyone has there thing no one can tell you otherwise."
"Meta-refusal gang lets go
My respect to him"
there's still a trigger cap. It's not like it would become  full auto.
Ya but making it faster in general could do some damage
That is actually 1000 iq what the hell lmao
just click faster
Ya but this can go faster than humanly possible
I just googled it and didn�t know this was a thing. :o
I should say that the game has kick me out more than I once because it can�t register that many commands at once all the time so be carful
how do you change ur click to ur scroll??
"You go to keybingins and there are 2 slots next too fire, one of then should be empty, click on the empty one and scroll which ever way you want it to be. My perfected way is down but it�s just preference."
"No, people have been doing this since the COD 4 days. Also evens the playing field with controller IMO since shooting fast with the triggers is so much easier than on a mouse."
"I'm still waiting for the day a COD game adds a full auto FAL as it is irl... With crazy recoil, like fire 3 shots and be looking at the ceiling crazy recoil, of course..."
Not cheating but I don't see why you would. Its not hard at all to hit the firerate cap just normally clicking
"Nope, the game has a firecap. As long as you aren't exceeding the cap you're good. My friend plays KBM on Xbox and he can shoot insanely fast just using the left mouse button, not like he's cheating lol. 

Plus in my experience scroll wheel firing is generally less accurate for me because I'm holding the mouse different to normal when I scroll, might just be me though 

Fun fact: during the beta the semi auto Famas had no firecap. You could shoot the entire mag in like a second with the scroll wheel."
"I think the first prominent implementation of this was with the dual berettas in CS 1.6. 

Pretty sure plenty were doing it in the original Modern Warfare when fire rates weren't even limited."
"Ain�t nobody gonna watch a 7.5 minute clip to get to whatever the point is. The game has a mute feature, use it."
I even skimmed it and couldn�t figure out what it is
Mute button was created for a purpose
"To save everyone 7+ minutes :
This is essentially just a clip of someone on OPs team calling out their position to the enemy team(granted, shitty move), and op proceeding to spam report them for every reportable option. 
As for the hate speech, there is no audible hate speech in this video, it may have been in game chat but it�s too blurry to make majority of it out.
Either way, it seems op is just very salty. Just don�t read chat."
"For everyone's benefit, I'm not talking about the mic chat. The player literally typed it all so I couldn't mute him. Normally I do. No, he took the time to go from calling us fat b*tchs to progressively calling us worse things such as sl*ts and all the way to being extremely transphobic. The later ones while he was on our team. The second match he started calling out where our teammates were to the other team and then started team killing us. In the end he said ""I hope you and your children all get r*ped"" 
So it was exploiting and hate speech and you know Activision won't do anything about it."
I�m getting crashes on PC too.
I told him he should uninstall the game once we are done playing and reinstall it.
I�m on Xbox and it�s also crashing and lagging badly.
Lmao blops. BLOP BLOP!
yes mw is os much better as a game compared to black ops cold war
"Oh look, another post on the MW sub reddit where it shits CW again. Totally haven�t seen posts like these since December. Regardless of how you feel about it, people have preference and will still play CW just like how people will continue playing w MW. Don�t like the game? Cool, fine.. don�t play it then. It would be nice to see items that are actually related to what the sub reddit is about and not about the constant talk of a game people don�t enjoy for whatever reason they state."
[removed]
Correct
"Warzone has always had weird optics for ground loot weapons, especially SMGs. This was the case way before Cold War was even announced. I don�t really have an explanation, but I�ve noticed as well."
But how come they're literally all either thermal or thermal hybrid optics? If it were a few I wouldn't care but it's weird that a few guns like the as Val or the spr which could have been very strong ground loot have almost been nerfed
"All I can think is they want the ground loot to be terrible so you don't get those hotdrop situations where you win because you get the best RNG gun to promote getting the loadout.

But then they always put an overpowered ground loot weapon in anyway so who knows atleast when I played)."
Man warzone sounds like the lamest shit

Literally my life when I play Search
Every... damn... time!
"Umm, I mean he's obviously not cheating since he stopped shooting. But what triggered him to slide and snap on the to door and start firing with such conviction? No UAV and I don't see any teammates who could've possibly provided a call out. I'm honestly curious how or why you started shooting through the door so confidently."
Child if you're watch again there a spam grenade before in the corner and it just a bait. so he's know guy pick up the pace to flank him otherside because that I would do if I were that guy.
"I have played *a lot* of Search and Destroy on this game and people are predictable so I knew that there was probably one hiding in there given that I killed the ones that pushed rugs and tunnel. I try lots of wallbang spots in every game though, helps pick up an easy kill here and there once you learn where people like to sit and wait."

"Had one person in a game who could Melee without being near anybody. The fella killed me and somebody else, showed up as fists in the kill feed but when my body fell i could see him on the other side of Shipment using a launcher.  


Might have been an odd glitch but there was nobody near either of us when it happened."
"Wow this one is new for me! You know that there have to be something really wrong, when there are so many hacks / exploits / glitches, that you cant tell then apart :/ don't get me wrong, I love this game, but I'm getting tired of all this bullshit. Seems that they are doing anything to trash the MW for CW $$$"
Best was the 98-10 drop this guy pulled on nuketown last night. Watched in theatre and had obv aimboy and wallhax.  I mean who TF cheats in nuketown or any other mp map for that matter.

"Ive got 2fa and a really good password, so i shouldnt get hacked at all. But yeah, if youve got 2fa and a decent password your set"
"Yeah it would also help to link and unlink every account slot, as well as enabling 2fa on each of them"
"Except people who�ve had 2FA enabled on their ATVI accounts have reported their accounts were compromised long after doing so. 

Imagine being annoyed at other people�s misfortune though. 

And an FYI the accounts were compromised due to at least 2 data breaches of Activisions servers. We already know they senselessly send the backup 2FA codes to your email if you set it up. How much you want to bet those codes are no more protected on their servers than passwords were?"
"Well for one, there�s no proof those people actually had 2fa on, and they probably used a breached pass"
"And I�m not annoyed that at their misfortune, I�m annoyed that they are shocked that they got hacked when they took no precautions . It�s like going on vacation while leaving your door wide open, and then being shocked you were robbed."
�Easily guessable passwords� lmao how does one guess a random persons password you don�t guess your accounts get leaked or by websites you go on not to mention activision has been hacked twice
I mean they reuse passwords and use ones that have been leaked before
"Many people can't activate 2fa and activision doesn't give a fuck, so fuck off."
"I have 2fa on my PSN account, i should be good right?"
"Nope, has to be your cod account"

"While I do use trigger stops on my xbox controller, I am honored that you think I use that"
"OK never mind, for anyone else who's struggling, press 3 on the keyboard. Still, this is a bug that should be addressed."
"well you got top hardware and already tried everything, so not sure. for me it was too much VRAM usage, i just lowered textures and set videomemoryscale to less than 0.85

check the crash log for errors, try changing BIOS XMP memory profiles if any, disable raytracing etc, run the launcher and game as admin."
"I get this issue sometimes when using Gamebar/Relive capture in the background. It comes and goes. If you're using shadow play try disabling it and see how it goes.

Only thing I can suggest from my end. Never had the issue with recording off."
"You know what helped me? 

Using MSI afterburner to limit my 980�s clock to 1400Mhz that got fixed with season 2 (mw not cw) now everytime I get it I just restart my pc and it works (note I do have fast boot turned off. Fast boost must be deselected for a restart to fully take effect. You can do this by going into control panel -> power options -> on the left pane, choose �what the power button does� -> at top of screen click the button that allows you to make changes -> then below that section fastboot is the first option, untick it."
tried all different clock speeds.. nothing is working.
Did you find a fix? This is happening to me and I've spent 3 hours trying everything. I also have a 3080
"the only thing that semi worked was using DDU to uninstall all nvidia gpu related drivers and then use the driver from Dec 2. i say semi worked because i cant play apex.. this fix only works for warzone, for me at least."
I heard it couple be a ram issue with overclocking or xmp. Try 3200mhz tops
"I play Ground War a lot and I notice this too. I just think sometimes there are just a lot more sweats sweating hard in some matches too.

I also feel like this board needs to have a serious conversation with devs about the Ground War maps. 

Krovnik Farmlands is atrocious. Riverside can be a disaster and so can Boneyard.

I tend to like Airport, Tavorsk District (my love), and Promenade as a meat grinder."
Palace is the worst. You always get those sweaty cheesy try hards that try to hold E for the spawn kills.
"And also map rotation. Holy fuck, the last 2 weeks I have been getting nothing but aniyah and krovnik. It never used to be like this, I would get a decent rotation of all maps. Now Promenade literally won�t show up. Like no joke, I thought they took it out lol"
I think a lot of the newer maps they added limit options so it's become more noticeable when your team is outmatched. Promenade is so linear if your team is steam rolled you can't escape it. Airport is better but there's a ton of open space around C flag and the only real good alternative is all the way around the airport. Verdansk riverside is 90% wide open space so stepping outside is like walking in to rush hour traffic if the cars were snipers. It became very apparent they just started dropping in chunks of the warzone map and didn't really think about how they'd play in ground war.
"There almost definitely is, just not as strong as normal MP.   
It would take forever to fill a lobby if it was too strict"
"Just got done with a long stretch of ground war. I played 20 matches total. Finished top 3 on my team in all but 2 matches. My win/loss was 4-16. All those losses my team basically sat in the spawn or at the first flag and didn't even try. So yeah, SBMM is definitely in ground war. The same thing happens to me in MP where it fills my team with brainlets thinking I can pull their weight. It's really annoying. The game would be much more enjoyable if they removed SBMM entirely."
If so its not heavy handed. The matches have become so tilted anymore. Its feast or famin depending on the match making. sbmm is either broken or non-existant.

"This is due to a bug that raven introduced in the December update. They�ve had zero interest in fixing it. It has effected around 4 modern warfare operator packs that were released these last couple months and most people are still waiting for them thinking they haven�t come out yet. 

It even affected the Roze pack until enough people complained on twitter and they manually fixed it. Unfortunately that fix didn�t seem to resolve the overarching issue, instead only being isolated to the Roze pack. 

Looking forward to seeing the complaints when Soap releases and 99% of the community that�s been waiting for him aren�t able to get him. What an absolute shitshow Raven has been. But hey they�re tweeting at random YouTubers on Twitter so there�s that."
"Great, so that means we're not even getting Vault Packs when Soap gets fixed, nice"
I wasn�t aware of this. Has the Rainbow Sparkle Domino pack been released for other people?
Same.
Mine haven�t showed either

"Unless they come in vaultpacks, no, there is no way to unlock any battlepass mil-sims at this time"
"Shit, ok, thanks"
"There are a couple options available actually. First, if you have a friend who has one of the milsims (or any purchase from the store) you can have them download the Call of Duty App. The app keeps track of all purchases in MW you've made and allows you to ""gift"" any of the purchases to another friend.. 

Secondly you can go to the armory and if you go to any weapon variants/blueprints you haven't purchased you can click ""view"" and it will take you to the store pack that includes that weapon.. Some of these will include certain ops or skins for ops that were previously available but no longer are.

I have purchased 3 or 4 mil sim packs so let me know which you are looking for i may be able to help."
Wait how does the gifting thing work? Would it just be buying them another copy? Is it free?

His call outs are so fucking good.
What�s your setup
"Ah yes, I also video game my dudes! I call all of the duties"
I believe platinum is earned by getting gold for every gun in that category. Like all assault rifles gold. Guns like the Grau that are earned through past battle Passes and the store are by themselves. Meaning you could just get the Grau gold and platinum without getting all other assault rifles done first.
"You need to do the base weapons of the category you want in platinum, so if you want let�s say the M4 platinum you need to do all the assault rifle except the Ram, Grau, Amax, An 94 and the AS Val. And also if you want one of the non base weapons you need to get it gold after you have platinum for the category."
This is the correct answer.  Here is a very help link https://damascus.now.sh

For the Knife it just looks like the base knife. Should have clarified that."
I'm having the problem were if I install pack 3 it tells me that pack 2 is uninstalled. I've installed both and installed them again but still the same.
Same

Same!! Why is this!?
Same!

i have the exact issue.

all 3 are downloaded but texture pack 2 says not installed"
Same.
Same
Has anyone found a fix for this?
Same issue ....  not sure if it is to do with all of the time outs and shitty gameplay or what ... xsx player with great WiFi
From what I understand texture pack 1 is the base HD pack that was a part of the original game at the start.. they removed this over storage complaints and gave it as an optional download. Texture pack 3 replaces texture pack 2 which is HD textures for the new season. So download 1 & 3 (which I�m doing now) and I�ll let you guys know if there�s a difference. I�m playing on and XB Series X with LG CX OLED so I should notice a difference if there is one.
"After downloading pack 1&3 I noticed that the gun detail was much better (real shine on metals) and overall I think the game ran a bit smoother, characters looked more detailed too."
Any updates on how the texture packs look like?
"I�ve noticed with the packs downloaded some things look better. For instance the short green grass blades on Aniyah Palace are better textured after I installed Pack 2 recently. 

I don�t know if it�s placebo nor do I have proof...but i noticed the grasses before seemed bland but now are more detailed like when the game originally released. 

Anybody else notice this?"
"I just got a message saying to install 3 from the game. I�ve never installed any so I assume I need to do 1, 2, then 3? Can anyone confirm or am I wasting a ton of room on my ps5 lol"
thats reason im here
1 stays installed. Packs 2 and 3 wont both be installed at the same time. Maybe pack 3 is an updated pack 2?
I play at 1080p 120hz (Xbox Series S) and noticed a huge difference in frame rate and smoothness after installing High Resolution Texture Pack 3. The movement became smoother like Cold War. Still a little confused why Texture Pack 2 disappeared unless Texture Pack 3 is just an �enhanced version� of Texture pack 2.
"Yes you are indeed correct it is only for those of us that have a console that is capable of Native 4K Xbox One X,Series X with 4K TVs �.The Series S is just like the One S it�s just a One S on steroids it doesn�t have native 4K like the One X and the Series X only upscales to 4K hope this helps those who wanna know also as for the PlayStations side  that offer native 4K ps4 pro and up to ps5 if I�m not mistaken"
So would it make a difference if I uninstalled 1 and had packs 2 and 3 downloaded as I play on 120 hz also
Was looking for answers on this too. Looks like the frame rate is smoother. Can anyone confirm this?
I can�t see a Fuck of a difference. I have a 1X and 4K OLED.
Supposed to enhance the quality of graphics on higher rate monitors with 4k HD ones. Think they are doing this as some may not have high definition monitors/TVs so it can save them some space on the hard drive as it's a optional download.
"It's a bit odd I play on a 4K HDR monitor I just don't recognize that much of a difference, not one that warrants over 40GB of space anyhow, would be nice to see comparisons."
These HD Texture Packs are basically our next-gen update. I'd like devs to be more clear about what each one does to see if worth the space they occupy
No they're not. These texture packs (at least 1 and 2) were installed by default when the game launched. They just weren't separated into packs at the time. They decided to lower the base game textures later on when people would whine about storage space and gave these HD packs optional for the people who aren't blind.
"I literally have no clue what any of these 3 high res packs changed,"
Still can�t get them all enabled smh
"Same for me, have you found any solution yet?"
"Sort of - as in everything is currently working but I dont trust that it will stay this way. At least it has given me a week of hassle free gaming.
What I did was install everything I could before it starts dropping things etc
Then I did a database rebuild. After that I installed the updates and missing packs and so far (fingers crossed) it remains usable and playable.

To get to the the safe menu on your ps5, turn it off

1) hold the power button until it beeps, continue to hold until it beeps a second time (about 7 seconds). Release power button

2) Ps5 should be in safe mode, connect a controller via cable

3) select rebuild database

4) wait for that and console should restart as normal

5) try to play cod...I had to update everything but it has stopped (for now) uninstalling parts of itself

Hopefully this works for ya! :)"
"Showing off R9 O DB and AR Gameplay? Really?

Like even sniper montages don't have this much of vfx... U don't need to put in so many especially for reg guns (and the most op guns in the game)

Like I could say something if it were a sniper montage but so much just for some reg gun and doof doof gameplay?

You've literally used the most powerful guns in the game like the as Val, Doof Doof etc. What can I even say..."
I now have epilepsy
"The same thing happened to me; your account was stolen. If you had the CoD companion app, check that out to see if you are still logged in. Then you can see the name of whoever stole your account. You'll have to contact Activision Support and file a ticket. I got my account stolen on 02/16, found out about it and contacted support on 02/20, and got it back yesterday on 03/02. It should take less than 10 business days if you can provide them with enough information. I wish you luck!"
"i'm still logged in but it says on the player tab that it's a private profile whos user doesnt share their stats (i wanna die these are my stats). if i manually look up my own profile i can see the match history though, so it looks like they havent changed the profile name or played any games just stolen it.

10 days is actual lunacy especially when they know there's a timed battle pass i submitted a complaint with the BBB since this appears to be a frequent issue"
"Where did you reach their support team? I messaged activision support on twitter as well as submit an ""account recovery request"" on the support website but have gotten no response in 3 days. I know I probably just need to be patient but it just sucks a ton and is stressing me out"
Dang that sucks
This sounds like you got your account stolen. Not sure if you can still fill out a recovery form since you used the same email for a new account.
Would I not have received an email or something that someone changed the email on my Activision account?
"Im in the same situation, have gotten no response in 3 days after messaging on twitter. I was still able to see my old account on https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone but it doesnt look like a hacker has actually played on it since there havent been any recent matches played. If you want I'll message you if I get any meaningful response back from support for my case. You should definitely dm them on twitter as well.

I believe our accounts were compromised in some data breach sometime in February(I last played in Jan then came back in March to find out about the account problem). Be sure to change your passwords for your other accounts and enable 2 factor for the services that allow it"
Can you recover your account?
Cod has always been final hit gets the kill
"Except BO4 and Cold War, but they're shit games so it makes sense they have shit mechanics"
"Nah, that just inflates stats."
as if stats even matter in this game.
"Yeah, you get 99 damage onna guy, then he hits 1 bullet for 1 damage and gets the kill. Its stupid. But stats dont matter either."
Lmao who doesn�t use EOD
Eod doesn�t stop explosive tip kills.
Did it add a fov slider ?
FOV wouldnt come in a texture pack lmao.  PC is great cuz you have so many options due to many different rigs requiring different configs
"Really would love to know what it does lol. I had a weird option in my settings recently that I noticed called download texture streaming. After this install that settinf was gone, same with with 2nd texture pack."
high iq
It makes me have faith in humanity when I see shit like this
"Ass loot? Wut guaranteed gold gas mask, guaranteed satchel, guaranteed self revive, guaranteed stacks.

My group got like 40k combined from there."
"Honestly man the gas mask is super situational, if you do well on positioning you won�t even need one. If you do need one a regular one does just fine and you can easily buy one of those. 

Satchels are all over the game, I usually find one within 5 minutes of dropping in pretty much any location on the map. Not to mention you used to be able to drop bunkers and get 5.3 million satchels per bunker. They took those out probably to make this one singular chest look better. 

Self res is pretty cheap to buy and if I don�t find one on a floor drop it�s pretty easy to buy. 

You get about 2k cash from the chest, and most stacks I see in the ship are the lowest stack possible. Honestly it�s about the same amount of cash as almost any other area I can drop in. 

The only unique thing about this ship is the zombies"
It's honestly one of the best starting locations in the game.
"Everyone's a douchebag or basically d***s, so there's gonna be bloodshed no matter what. Especially if you're on Asia servers."
I wish.  Or maybe it's just a plunder thing where people like to camp there.
Isn't the reward some ass cold war pistol blueprint? Why do people care about it?
I just like doing the challenges
"Got mine done all in plunder(except the final one which was BR specific), and the amount of people just camping on the roof killing people trying to get challenges done was insane.

Most of the people doing the challenges don�t really care about winning, just getting challenges done.

It�s like on shoothouse how someone sits in office with a shield hoping to get challenges done, and that one person just sets out to kill that one person the entire game."
"Yea lol when I find someone camping shoot house with a riot shield I let them kill me

I come back with my own riot shield and half the time they trade off with me so we can get that annoying ass thing out of the way"
"Yeah, I tried the crouch spam and no attacking to no avail."
"I always try that, works about 1/20 times lol"
"It's usually absolute bots that do it. Cant get a kill in normal gameplay so have to kill people trying to do other things. Probably dropped far and ran to the ship as well because the initial drop was ""too hot"""
Is this not the modern warfare sub?
"Yeap! When I put my Call of Duty Modern Warfare disk into my console the very first menu screen has an option to play warzone, a game mode that is a part of Call of Duty Modern Warfare... pretty sure I�m on the right place"
please do
"Pretty sure yes, you need all of them. I already had #1 and #2, and now I�m downloading #3 that was offered, it�s a new one"
Do you still have #2 showing as installed? Mine says not installed after installing #3 but in my game add ons it says I have all 3
Lol just found out I've been playing on the series X on a 4k TV without any of the high Res packs. Pretty hyped to see how it looks when I finish downloading (already looks stunning tbf)
Would love to know amswer for this
"I only had 1, cant see options for #2 or #3. im on Xbox one X, 4k monitor."
is it only displayed on 4k monitors or will there be any diff at 1080p?
"Just download and installed pack 3 on my ps5. After that some other game installs were gone, like multiplayer and compatibility packs. Have to download them all again (around 50 GB I guess)."
"I think this pack for next gen consoles, mybe u don't need it for ps4 or xbox one"
Press report player and type in what they said
"There used to be a report option for innapropriate language, but they removed it"
"The only reports that do anything are �cheating� which are automated to where if someone gets reported enough times for �cheating� they get shadowbanned for a week..


Kinda pathetic how these gamer stereotypes silently encourage this shit"
"Anyone saying ""just mute and get over it"" is definitely worried they'd be banned if there were punishments for being racist."
"Lmfao no I just know nothing is going to happen. I have been followed around called the n word by the same player for several weeks. I have reported him numerous times even sent in a support ticket. They don�t care lol

There is not even a report option for behavior like that"

im on ps4 pro too but not 4k monitor. Does it improve anything on 1080p displays?
Good question. I wanna know what this texture pack 3 version offers compared to the last two.
"Server optimization has been broken since Season 6. They gotta fix it soon.

And FYI, most of the money these business suits at Activision make from their games aren't handed to their worker's salaries. It goes to their higher ups (CEO-, investors, management, etc). None of the working-class staff earns anywhere close as them--they don't care a single fuck about any of their staff. So they'd care less about their games.

"So I installed Pack 3, but now Pack 2 uninstalled automatically. I can�t seem to get it to reinstall. Is this supposed to happen?"
"I have the same issue, uninstalling and reinstalling the packs don�t help either"
"I only have Pack 1. Never got a notification for 2. Some days back i briefly saw something for Pack 3 but it disappeared as I joined a lobby. Can't find it in the install files section not in the store. 

Any suggestions how I can download it and what it actually improves? Does it increase draw distance etc. Or is it bullshit improvements on gun details etc. only?"
yeah I have a One X too and I am curious as well.
[deleted]
Yeah I mean I have 1tb storage but this game literally takes up almost half of it and it�s like 4x bigger than my second biggest game
only download the packs you need to play
I mean high graphically enhanced games are going to require a lot more space. Games are just going to require more space as we progress in gaming technology
I just got a prompt for it. I'm also on Xbox One X. I have the other two already installed. I think the 2nd pack made a slight improvement to player models and weapons.
"Oh okay, yeah I was wondering if it affects the visuals of the gameplay at all but I think it might mostly be operators and guns. Just it�s like 20gb between the two that seems an awful lot for just that as well."
Where did you see the download options? I do not  see them anywhere on Manage Game Add-ons :( (Xbox one X)
You click on Call Of duty game installed 14 add ons installed and it brings you to all of them then select the one you want to download
Should I download this pack if I have Xbox series s
Yah it says it was for Xbox one X and Xbox series S and X
"I did, now it says my high resolution pack 2 isn�t installed when I hit start and go to game installs.  My Xbox says I do have it installed."
"I seen that today also I only had the first pack installed.

When I installed the 2nd and 3rd pack my god the brightness in the game was ridiculously high. And when I turned it down it made inside buildings way to dark. It did make the picture sharper though. I'm on xbox series x. 

Anyone any idea why the brightness went up?"
"I initially clicked no when entering the game & receiving the prompt to download, now I can�t figure out how to go back & find it to download... no where in the updates etc."
Xbox?
"Same, was hoping it would pop up again"
It's in the store for the game. Microsoft store that is.
yepon ps4 pro - got that msg first time after a few rounds of hc sts today. Hasnt come up again yet but I did a settings-acct-restore licenses and restarted just in case.
"Yes, that happened to my friend after he was permabanned because of an issue between Windows Insider and Overwolf apps. He created a new account and was shadowbanned for a week or two."

"No. All it does is remove HUD elements.

That being said, If you are quite tired of those Greasy Kangaroos, I've been working on building a group built around making MW into a pseudo tactical shooter akin to Insurgency Sandstorm, based around a group of fun people willing to play along with an enjoyable, casual, experience. It would be entirely in private matches with the right match settings, realistic loadouts, and people ""playing along"" with the premise. The gameplay would be very much like Arma CQB, Insurgency, (single fire mode only, unless using an MG, slow pacing, realistic movement and room clearing, communication, and low/realistic TTK) but the structure of the overall group would be very casual, no mandatory attendance, no assholes yelling at you cause some mistake you did got them killed. It'd be built around the potential of this game and it's realistic mechanics (peaking doors, select-fire, realistic damage range/barrel length correlation). Because it's privates, there will be absolutely no affect on your SBMM, KDR, or even your prebuilt loadouts, so there won't be ANYTHING we'll make you do that will hurt your personal COD career. Would you be into that? I'd be glad to post a link if you're interested"
"I have no COD career, don't worry about that. But yeah that sound cool dude."
"I would be interested, but I doubt I have time to really play all that often

Edit: Ah, frick, just realized I can almost never use my mic"
"If you're speaking in terms of campaign difficulty then realism is veteran difficulty with no HUD. So basically you just have to be more aware of your ammo, grenades, etc. If you're speaking in terms of multiplayer then its similar, no HUD, a headshot is an instant kill with any weapon, I'm not fully sure if there is any body shot differences from normal. Hope this helps!"
"Cheers man, yeah talking mostly online tbh. Like there's so many good tactical aspects like peaking doors and stuff but I've never seen it used because the games always played at 100 miles an hour."
"Hardcore is pretty fun, just play slowly, use attachments that dont just promote rush classes an use the alt fire to have more fun"
That sounds pretty spot on to what I'm looking for tbh.
"If ur down to play tactical HC S&D, or realism, add me up activision ID Toblerone. Also If realism warzone ever comes back you will have a blast."
"Realism moshpit is like one of the two dead playlists in this game, so I wouldn't get the game for that.

It is pretty fun mode though. Gives you actual immersion of being on a mission with your squad."
Haha I've literally just found that out. Tried hardcore instead though and having a good time with it.
Hence why people connect their controllers 24/7...

Just pick one and practice with it. Inconsistency will fuck you over in terms of learning what works
[removed]
"A high sens/low dpi and low sens/high dpi is the same thing. Better off just picking one dpi for all games and adjusting only the sensitivity of each game. I would only change the dpi if the sensitivity adjustment of a game literally can't go high enough with the selected dpi. Changing 2 variables all the time will just make things more difficult to keep consistent.

Plus if you keep your dpi consistent you can transfer your sensitivity to other games by measuring the distance you move the mouse across the mousepad to turn 90 degrees. At least if the game has a compass you can use to measure degrees.

I do agree with the others in the thread though. Gotta pick a sensitivity and stick with it for a while to get used to it.

Edit: Ignore first paragraph. I don't know anything."
"No, DPI has a lot to do with the granularity of your movement. Just because 2 different settings can travel the same left to right distance, the one with the higher dpi will be a lot less jittery"
maybe try dynamic response curve?
"Google ""raw accel"" or ""povohat's mouse accel"" , start using aim accel, it's so much better than normal, I have gone from a 1.2 kd to 2.6 kd in mw while using it"

"They reset their levels and locked them from being unlocked 


They did this before wirh the Cold War stuff you could get in warzone"
These Guns cant be leveled anymore for good reasons. People wont have the attachments early

"March 11th, boys."
imagine being an operator and the last thing you see before you die is a giant soccer ball about to crunch your bones to powder
"You got the ball first, clean tackle."
"I liked it, next time pick out the best best ones, and make the clips longer so we can see the 'context' cause even though its cool, its sort of just 8 minutes of quickscoping kills which isn't that engaging. If we see at normal speed the start of the round, score, etc. the context makes the clutch or the kills more hype."
The punching at 23 seconds is hilarious.
"I got it in December, game is still going strong"
Ill play with you and tons you can find a match in seconds
Plenty of people playing but don�t expect any support or future content. I�m sure people are gonna chime in and say there is one more content drop but that isn�t a guarantee.
"Tons of people still on this game, with more and more people switching from CW back to MW every week.  MW still pulls more viewers on twitch/youtube compared to CW"
You mean warzone
People are just playing whatever they feel like. I don't particularly like MW but I'll still hop on it now and again to play. Many people are probably the same. It isn't as black and white as people make it out to be
More people are playing cw multiplayer than mw so not true
Yes
Still plenty of people. Honestly it probably has more players than cold war. CW is an awful game. I uninstalled it after a couple hours. I know a lot of people feel the same way.
It doesn�t have more
"Picking up any COD after it's initial year is always a waste of money in my opinion unless it's on sale.

The game will likely not see any new content besides cosmetics and POSSIBLY a weapon or two but as time goes on that look less and less likely."
This is why I still play BF4 and have a good time
I bought it 2 days ago and it's pretty active. In my opinion it finds a match even faster than in Cold War.
Bec Cold War has stricter sbmm doesn�t have to do with player base more people play cw
Many players still keep playing MW and you can find lobbies fast enough. The lack of attention that the game absorbs from Activision is the main problem that u should consider.
Still has more players than  cold war
Personally I dislike the game I feel like many people are just in love with the engine rather than gameplay. Bec Cold War gameplay and the flow is far superior mw is just to slow and then they try to fix that by giving a faster time to kill which doesn�t work for me
"It�s all about preferences. I like MW gunfights more than CW because it�s smoother, and it feels like there�s more weight to the weapons than in CW.

CW feels more like a poorly optimized mobile game to me. I played COD mobile and had more fun in MP than in CW. The game just feels unfinished.

But hey, you enjoy CW, so that�s what matters. Everyone has their own opinions, and I�m not here to suppress yours. I�m just expressing my own."
Are those bots you playing against?
"apparently lmao, these kids were actin like bots"
I wish I could get in that kind of lobby
perks of a .95 k/d
Realism is tough. Cause there is no hit markers or xp shown. I dont think much people play with shoot the ship happenin
Always enjoyed the hell out of ground war realism  Warzone realism was easily one of my favorite modes as well.
"Agreed, Realism Ground War is easily my favourite mode in the game, it's a perfect blend of all my favourite things."
Ground war realism makes playing sneaky a joy
"The realism playlists have had broken matchmaking since launch. Another one that�s been like that was groundwar infected. They don�t fill the lobbies, so you�ll keep backing out and getting into unique lobbies that are all about half filled and you just sit in there until you give up. It�s not a population thing."
Happened to me last time I played too. With cold war and warzone popular not much people are playing modern warfare.
"People play realism, I do. But it's mainly populated when it's not in the QuickPay filter"
"I'm looking for realism actually, played it once and haven't been able to find it since but I'd rather not play shoot tge ship cuz I like variety any hrlp?"
why cant I post a new topic. Every time I do it does not show up.
"This sub has some very odd rules for posting. Besides the normal ""can't have a brand new account"" there's other invisible factors which lead me to believe a mod (or the mod team) only lets certain people post, or if they simply don't like a post, they don't allow it to be seen

I prefer slight of hand but it�s whatever"

Do shield. When I first started mine I did launchers and melee so the rest of the grind would be easier. Future you will thank you
"Thanks bro, exactly what I was thinking"
Any recommendations for launchers? Just finished the shield
"Make sure you are tracking progress! You don�t want to play for an afternoon to only find out the game has glitched out and hasn�t tracked anything. Good luck, it�s a long ride."
I�m about to knock out the knife and shield both in one go that way I�ll only have three remaining shotguns to finish the grind.
Melee. AR Lmg in that order. Pistols and launchers as secondaries for ARs and LMGs everytime your clip runs out switch to secondary and use it. If launchers use ammo up then go to primary. Melee I found easy idk. Shotguns i did them all in 2 days they�re so fast. Snipe whenever. Not the order I did it. But def the order I wish I did for speed. Smgs and shotguns I think are easiest and done fastest on shipment so either blow through them first and wish you were using them the rest of the time or save them for last so you can enjoy them more when the time comes.
"Thanks, guess ill do the shield now in shoot the ship"
"And don�t be afraid to ask people on the other team for help in the game chat. When I was towards the end of shields, I was sooooo close that I decided to just throw it out there. Like 4 people agreed and just started running towards me and turn around so I could get the kills. Sometimes the game ain�t toxic lol"
"This is true, when playing ffa you can talk with everyone: some people were willing help. From now on, everytime a guy in a shield approaches I will let him kill me"
"https://damascus.now.sh/

This will be your best friend."
"Wow, so only two-thirds of the weapons are needed for Damascus? It's not so impressive to me now. I thought *everything* had to be Gold."
"When using the shield, don't listen to the fuckers telling you to camp in the middle container in shipment. You need to rush your heart out, spamming stuns on the way."
"As someone who has Damascus on every weapon in the game, START ON MELEE. It was the biggest bitch for me, and everything after that was much more enjoyable."
"Thanks bro, i started with the shield. Im at 13/25 of the last camo. Hopefully from there it will be more enjoyable as you said lol

I already got gold kali sticks, so I dont expect the knife to be too difficult."
"Do the shield and melee first, run launchers as a secondary after that.  (Put camouflage on that shield so people like me know you�re grinding)

From there work on weapons you don�t care for as much and as you get gold and platinum work towards the ones you like most.

Marksman and snipers are good in shoot house for long, mounted, reptile, and headshots combined.  So start with your least favorite and work towards those you like most with each category."
"Thanks bro, just finished the shield. I used your recommendation on putting a camo on the shield. Found at least one guy willing to help in hardcore free for all every now and then."
You need to look wheter they are for CW or warzone only
"All the operators in the new season are for Cold War, so any missions must be completed in Cold War multiplayer or Warzone.  It won�t progress in multiplayer."
"Yeah I noticed this a few hours after I made this post, what a load of shit I wouldn't have got the battlepass if this was the case."
"Shield, kali sticks and smoke. Propably the must annoying way to play the game."
"Got beat one too many times eh? The MOST annoying would be quick scoping, stand to prone sweatys."
Hmm maybe I�ll start using quick fix
Just uninstall life kid
So much melee hate
"All I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize."
"Crazy all I�m reading is cringe, cringe, cringe."
found the val user
Bring back the SPR glory days
Learn to quickscope
Nah I perfer to play realistic like what the army does
it's easy af and annoying though
Use a shotgun and camp. Duh.
"that takes just as much skill as quickscoping, so pretty fair, yea.

I'd recommend the 680 for this purpose"
Play Cold War it doesn�t have quickscoping
"Search for a game and the button will be there,"
"This may sound trivial, but did you make sure your friend had your exact name and battlenet ID when purchased?"
"yes thanks for replying. i got a notification on blizzard app after it processed.     

my idea is that Modern warfare has degenerated into warzone, so mw doesnt exist on blizzard anymore. does that seem right?"
Use the shield on hardcore with a knife and amped. Use smokes to get around the map. When you get on shoothouse sit in the tiny wooden buildings corners and melee people that come by. When you finish the shield play core on only shipment with the knife. It was actually very fun to do the knife.
" his game is literally riddled with cheaters its unplayable, pathetic. I want a refund."
You can do that?
"Yeah, somehow you can kill another player with your tactical grenade, like flash or smoke. It's still rather a rare occurance."
"Hit then with the actual grenade that's tossed you can pretty rare tho. I think it does less than 10 damage hell  maybe less than 5. Also I believe that the stuns and flashes have a small damage radius too, like 2 damage I think."
Tactical Grenade kills remain the funniest WTF moments in the game
"Go in the audio settings, set the sound to ""low boost"", thats what I did with my new headset, had to dial back the sound effects volume. Have you tested them on other sound sources to see if it sounds off?"
"I actually tried every audio mix and even with surround on and off , didn't make a big difference"
"Footsteps are super inconsistent since S2. Not sure what happened but I sometimes don�t even hear friendly footsteps now either.

Weird thing is that it�s only sometimes."
Footsteps not playing has been a recurring issue since beta and to my knowledge has yet to be acknowledged.
Enable dtsx headphone
You mean the surround or the option in surround ? And should I keep it on high or what ?
"Boost high/low preference really. Turn ""Master volume"" to 100. Turn ""Music"" to 0. Dialogue 100 for me and ""Effects"" 100 always. Then just adjust your head set volume manually.

That's what I do. But its all subjective everyone is different."
"I tried that , it burst my ears as every single volume get way high"
"personally recommend the 'boost high' eq setting. footstep sounds are mid to high frequency sounds most of the time. this will also bring out more details in the overall audio

i also recommend lowering in game voice audio (not chat but announcers, 'enemy vtol in the ao' etc) to make more space for other sounds like footsteps. i think i have the setting at 50

in the same vein i use the stealth comms eq setting for chat audio. it uses a smaller frequency band (basically sounds like talkie walkies) which again leaves room for other sounds"
"i havent had this issue, might be ur ps4"
"You have to load Cold War to play it, but they are showing it in modern warfare.  If you have Cold War, load zombies and that�s how you can initiate the missions."
"I figured it out!  My storage was full but never made me aware. So it downloaded it, but it also didn�t download it..  thanks"
I don't know what the issue could be but did you try all the usual things like scan & repair the game or update your graphics card drivers?
[deleted]
I would be fine with this if they didn't try and push/shoehorn Cold War (and to a lesser extent Warzone) stuff into Modern Warfare.
Because Cold War is the new game. When the next cod game comes out Cold War will be abandoned so don�t act surprised.
"Enough people dont understand this, mw is ""done"" now the BPs are CW"
"If people are playing still, and there's easy money to be made... Make the money."
"It's the usual yearly cod cycle. The only difference this time is Warzone was built into MW. 

If that wasn't the case MW would likely be left behind to die like the rest of the games while the studio moves onto the next game to meet the yearly release schedule that Activision pushes for.

I wish Activision, EA and others would release map tools for their games so the community could make new maps. It wouldn't cost the publisher anything outside of the time to make the tools public and a game would get new content for as long as the community is interested. That's what [csgo does](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165009177)."
"By the game staying alive they believe it will reduce the people who buy the newer ones.

 I think if they kept these two games alive for an additional year with warzone and just released new seasons it would work out great since the players who like black ops and the players who like mw would continue to play them and buy battle passes, but leaving mw out of it kind of just makes players like me leave the franchise for a couple of cycles, mw is the first cod I've gotten since bo1"
I just want to play MW multiplayer. That�s it. I don�t even play warzone. But I have to download a 80gb fucking patch for a game and mode I don�t play. I hate this.
Same
"I've read there may be new DLC for MW coming March 11th.  Stay frosty, fay stosty..."
they should put at least like 10 or 15 interchangeable (this the right word? Lol) tiers like the vehicle ones but with skins and blueprints
"I know its not much there are vehicle skins

Edit what i WISH they�d do is make all the cosmetics (like stickers, charms and finishers) universal no matter what or who you play, that way there is something for everyone

Yes most blueprints and operator skins and shit will be for cold war but cmon, i dont think it�d negatively affect much to allow us to use cold war finishers with a mw operator like ghost or talon (and vice versa)"
"I understand the people who say ""it's just the COD cycle"", but at least the other games had a little bit of support. Like BO4 was still being somewhat supported in 2019. We haven't had any somewhat major updates for MW since CW was released, (as far as I can remember) and it's been four months. From what I can tell, the biggest update is that we got our menu design BACK. Not a new design (separate from CW), nothing that'll effect the games, just a giving back a menu that they took from us. No other COD game has been dropped this hard this quickly, in a very, very long time.

The worst part to me is how hard it is for Activision to release the 3 guns that are ALREADY PLAYABLE. Would it really hurt Activision to release 3 guns that we can already use? Is CW really so bad, that giving 3 guns to the old game would kill it? What's stopping them? CW is already selling well, it's not like the game is going to lose 50% of it's revenue by adding guns to an old game. They don't need to add anything else, they don't need to add any new maps, game modes, or cosmetics. Just the guns. It's not hard."
"> Like BO4 was still being somewhat supported in 2019.

Well yes, because BO4 was released at the end of 2018, so 2019 was its Seasonal year.

Just like how MW19 was released at the end of 2019, so 2020 was its Seasonal year.

I don't see what you meant by that statement."
I expected it but I�m pissed at the fact we still have to download 18gb update for nothing
I just found that the charms from season 1 are now available in MW. I am pleased about that.
"I think people are forgetting one VERY important thing.  We have 47 maps and none of those maps, weapons, costed extra like in ALL the previous COD's I mean shit other than the ""variety map pack"" for MW remastered I had to pay for all the DLC

I've only been playing since black ops 3 but I think MW has the most maps and guns of any COD title so far.   it sucks for me until I can afford 600 bucks for starlink and its available in my area the whole 6VS 6 thing is getting old  I mean okay 11 in FFA but still

there's some really great maps that would play a lot better with more than 6 vs 6  in multiplayer.

the least IW could do is give players like me the 10 vs 10 option I'm sure the game can handle it LOL at one time I thought I saw a petition for it online lol"
10v10 mosh pit is in the game
Technically that�s not true as there are two vehicle skins for MW in the battlepass.
It�s the old game. I�m sure they want benefit the developer that is currently producing the spotlight game.
"Warzone killed Cod MP. 
There�s no going back. That�s their cash cow. Didn�t make any sense for Mw to get more support even tho it�s the most successful cod of all.  AW, BO3, & WW3 cod 3 full years of dlc content."
Maybe because the battle pass is cw and warzone?
"Fine by me, MW have alot of stuff"
"here fwiw

"Honestly? I learned with the shooting range trials they had at one point. Theres a lot of targets everywhere, you're timed, and it helps you practice with centering on the target and gives you a score accordingly. However, ive heard people say that with the latest update that some missions were removed and I'm not sure if that applies to trials too. I hope not."
"I did check the trials but they are limited, is there any unlimited way of me keep trying to improve my centering?? Do you know any aim trainers for controllers?"
"Are you on pc? If so then you can play Aim Lab and do some of their practice. 

If not then just keep playing online and don�t mess with your setting more than you have to. If you continually change settings then you can never effectively build muscle memory and break through where you are."
"Crosshairs show where your guns bullets go when you hip fire at that moment, obviously. Before you ADS have your gun just on the right side of your target. More likely to hit your hip fire shots and aim on target faster/better."
"I�m usually ADS walk because I play SnD so I usually don�t see the dot. But even if I did, I usually like that dot way over and then miss my shot"
"Feel like the term you�re looking for is aim rather than centering. If you see a big difference in aim against bots vs other players, your mentality may be playing a big part. If that�s the case, I suggest grinding fast-paced, high intensity playlists like shoot the ship. This might give you less time to think and eventually break you out of the mindset thats holding you back. Kinda like exposure therapy lol. 
Also try just playing around with your mental state going into games. Confidence on its own will greatly improve  your performance. Try to harness it. 

Also don�t turn off aim assist when aim training. It�s just gonna throw you off when it gets turned back on again."
Do you think playing shoot the ship might help improve aim?
"I tried shoot the ship, aim was bad but that wasn�t the frustrating part, it�s the people camping is what�s annoying and that�s why I�m never going to play again. I�m not someone who enjoys fast paced Maps game. I hate nuketown and shipment. I don�t like chaos, I like 4v4 - 6v6 wheee you can hear footsteps and need a strategy to win and also, aim so far more important in these games modes IMO compared to shoot the ship kind of stuff, still don�t know how to aim though..."
"You might have a sensitivity that is too high for your current ability with your used input (mouse/controller). 

Having a high sensitivity is great, because you can afford not to check every corner since if you get shot you'll be able to react, however only player with much experience can use it successfully, the best way to get to the point is by starting with a pretty low one and then escalating. After a long break from CoD I couldn't hit the enemies so I put my sensitivity to two, then after months I switched to 6 and now I'm at 8, after a bunch of other years."
"I�m playing on 4-4 bud, any slower and I won�t be able to turn."
"so what i do is shoot ahead and up, more and more as distance gets farther"
I can give that a try!
"Are you getting killed before you can shoot them, or just missing? Because there's a difference between not having a good reaction time, and missing shots."
Missing shots.
"Only the things you want to play, do you want to play multiplayer? Install ALL mp packs, not just half"
"first off, you always need both data packs so install those, if you want mp download mp packs, if you want survival download survival packs"
"When the game came out i play on max settings without any problems.

Then a few months went by after a break and i could only play on the lowest settings.

Well, welcome to 2021 and i cant play at all because im having 4 fps in the menu and my pc is going slow mode when mw is opened.

can anyone guide me sowhere on how i can fix this?"
But not as fast as the bullet
I�ve yet to find one that can outsmart bullet
He DOES speed
It was a good game plagued with bad project managers. That�s why I can�t stop playing it even though it pains me after a while and I have to take a break.
"Same here, cannot agree with you more. I cannot play the game more than three hours without taking a break, but it is mad addicting and am playing it every single day lol."
a very accurate description of MW
My favorite call of duty since MW3. IMO one of the 5 best ever and the gunsmith is my single favorite aspect in any cod ever
"Tbh being top five for CoD isn�t that impressive which is sad. That being said, I agree it�s a top-5 cod. MW, MW2, MW19, MW3, WAW, BO, BO2 are the only games that are in there with a shout."
"
Compared to other cods its good, compared to other shooters its medium."
Honestly cod has always been a medium shooter lol
What shooters are better in ur opinion?
"""WAS"" good until they started this Black Ops bullshit.  
Seperate game, keep them separate. Fuck off I don't want to play Crap Ops."
"Great game. Complete shit maps. I love the gunplay and general feel of the game but Euphrates bridge, Piccadilly, and the new maps are complete fucking garbage."
Interesting you say the new maps are bad because I thought the launch maps were trash but the added maps were much better.
"It�s a great game the mechanics and everything are amazing other shooters feel like garbage. My problem is the immense catering to casuals (makes complete sense economically I get it, but makes for a terrible competitive experience) 

You cannot enjoy this game if you�ve even had 1 beer or are just trying to relax. You need to be on your absolute A game to not get shit on constantly. SBMM combined with countless features catering to rejects and campers (extraordinary loud foot steps, shotguns with hit boxes the size of a watermelon, claymores, RPGs, OP meta breaking guns, the list goes on feel free to add) make it so difficult to play in a way that is not absolutely boring"
What an earth-shattering surprise these results are!
"For real tho, best COD since MW2, and MW2 only holds up so well due to nostalgia. That game was a completely broken mess (one-man army noob tubes, nuke-boosting etc.) toward the end of its life cycle, while this game is holding up damn well"
Good because it brought me back to cod after the flop that was infinite warfare
"Good game with mostly terrible/bad maps. Weapon feel is great, movement feels crisp and smooth, and the run speed is good. I love the weapon customization as well.

 Directional sound is awful though, 75% of the time I can't even hear the enemies footsteps and when I do, I can't tell where they are coming from. It just doesn't work, biggest complaint all of my friends have. 

Warzone is great but one major letdown is the netcode. Everything about Warzone I like except for that damn netcode and tickrate. Too many shoot first die first deaths, inconsistent damage, ghost bullets, etc. If they could get some good servers for Warzone, it's all I would play.

Overall, solid 7/10 for me."
"Granted I haven't played since season 1 but at that time the game was plagued with weirdness that really prevents me from being able to call it a good game.

Bad lighting making people inside buildings invisible.

Bad netcode, even for a CoD.

The most egregious left hand disadvantage ever seen. Literally expose 80% of yourself before you could see round a corner.

One AR invalidated all other weapons.

Sniper shots consistently phasing through targets.

Poor map design and spawning as well as some terrible objective placement in SnD.

Questionably effective aim assist.

Inconsistent sound.

I quit mid season 1 because the Devs at the time only acknowledged 1 or 2 problems. I'm going to go out on a limb and assume not much has changed.

It could have been the best cod to date. But it was hampered by shit design and perhaps some laziness."
"Good game ruined by cost cutting mainly via pick n mix servers that will intermittently be replaced by 12 tick decade old trash that's in no way suitable for a game like this 


Meanwhile battlefield 4 is still hosting servers literally 3x better and 90 percent of them are empty .
Cashgrab game"
"The game was fun


I picked it up for 25$ on Christmas Day and it was the best I was a noob but spec ops was so fun 


It was refreshing 

After I started to get into mp it was amazing 


All the fun memories all the times I called bullshit on hit reg it was fun 


Warzone came out and my friends and I enjoy it 


Soon it started to get 


*stale*


I wasn�t playing it a lot and when I did it felt 

Old 

It was pointless almost to me 


The game ran its course with me 

I keep it so my friends have someone to play with when they need a 4th man or someone else"
Can�t relate I love playing it when my friends are actually not making up dumbass excuses to not play it
Answer is right in the title. Modern Warfare WAS good until they turned it into a big ad.
If the maps were good this would be the best cod game ever but i still play it
Good game. Bad maps (play and flow wise). Bad matchmaking
Game was just designed for new players. Thats one of my biggest issues with it. Wouldn�t say its good or bad though because I have fun sometimes.
I wouldn�t say new players but definitely more casual with the map design. Could have been the best cod ever made but SBMM and most maps are complete shit. Shame.
"Good but a lot of bad decisions have brought down the potential, a game not reaching its potential is frustrating"
Extremely. MW could've been a 10/10 game. It got closer than most though.
"""you will NEVER become big on twitch. you will never reach more than 5 viewers at a time. you will have to find a wagie job and slave away your whole life. everyday that passes, you are less and less employable. tick tock, ttver!"" is what I'd say if warzone had a chat."
"""Please don't report me for aiming at you behind the baseplate.""?"
You can see one of them pop their head above it...
"My only guess would be that it doesn't qualify the game as being owned since it's connected to a different account than the one that purchased it. But I'm now expert, that's just my guess."
"Hardcore shoot house is your friend, I even had to camp for 3 kill streaks because this sniper sucks so much"
Hardcore FFA is probably the best mode to grind any weapon aside from the actual bolty snipers. Honestly Dragunov isn't bad when you do a full ADS build on it.
This is gonna sound weird but I really like the gun. I hate the look but if you get the plague sore bluprint through the challenges it makes it better. You can at least look at a pretty gun while you die.
"You got too much time on your hands my man! 
Also, proper good job on getting it!"
"Cold War is great and all, but modern warfare is much better. I agree that it should be worked on more, but season 7 is coming!"
"Wish this game got worked on for a second year rather than Cold War being a thing, that would�ve been so much better"
What the hell does that have to do with this post
"I am struggling with JOKR ground killstreak or vehicle kill

every game I beg people to use personal radar or counter UAV, and it rarly helps"
I just played ground war.. just wait 5 minutes and depending on the lobby you may or may not be swimming in personal radars
hey does anyone have any tips to make unlocking gold on the jokr easier? thanks :D
"Use the thermal to lock on faster and don�t be afraid to ask in lobby.  Tell them you�re grinding the joker, people like me will help.  I�ve also heard hardcore free fo all was a good place to grind personal radars, but haven�t tried as I completed it last time."
[deleted]
"Play hardcore shipment, because hardcore only requires one hit for a kill. 

Many like to camp with it in one of the containers, but for me rushing through the map worked better (I lack the patience to camp anyway)

Will be frustrating anyway, 3 kills in a row is a tough one and will get on your nerves, but this seems to be the fastest way.

Good luck!"
Shield was my first ever weapon I got gold for its super simple on shipment all you need to to throw smoke and also have throwing knives to be safe and make sure you run the amped perk and restock
Play hardcore Free for all and team with someone to help You keep trying You will find someone and dont forget to help people when your done i got demascus and i help people get. The shield done.
I love the blueprint my man
"Now a days In shipment I feel like there are more people running around with shotgun and spamming gunships.

Totally ruining the camo grind...."
I need hardcore most people are good enough people to not use shotguns
Well done mate. I�d expect your account info to get sold by some hacker eventually. Your account is now desirable for having a mastery camo and Hactivision�s security is lacking majorly. I have had mine stolen recently and I have Damascus and DM Ultra and all I can do is watch some of who bought the information play on my account

"4 days!!! I got mine in 11...

That was well before shipment was added."

Exactly how long does it freeze for? Have you tried just waiting on it?
THE NUMBERS MASON WHAT DO THEY MEAN?!
You forgot to turn of your projector.
It�s a glitch at the beginning of the match.  If you stop and make your character check the time it goes away
How do you get this watch?
I don't know about this watch but I know you could get a halloween time projector watch during the warzone Halloween event
Yeah that happens with my holloween one too just turn off the watch and back on or check watch idk which one it was
That's some *Strange Magic* indeed
Maybe you got shadow banned or are you on wifi
How would one get shadow banned?? I didn�t even know that was a thing in cod
I have a wifi extender setup and an Ethernet running from it to my computer so yes wifi no technically
If you are being investigated for cheating its a shadow ban are using WiFi or are you hard wired
Well I�ve never used hacks and like I said I recently converted to pc so my aim is absolutely terrible so it�s hard to believe I�m being investigated for cheating or at least I hope lmao
But yeah technically not hard wired

"I'm getting constant black screens, crashes. No idea what's going on"
Its random with every update they push out idk why. Last patch it made me lag every time i respawned and now its back to normal but matchmaking lag like you. Just wait til next patch for a fix sorry. Beenox doesnt care
The game used to crash for me after 10 minutes of playing and the solution i found was to change the exe of the game when you are playing it like if the exe is MW.exe I changed it to MW.exe1 and it fixed everything for me
"1. I don�t think so you can�t play with anyone else because it gets crazy you can get people and play with them and not randoms 


2. It should be like this 

Special operations 
Survival
Classic 

(It�s the first one .) which leads you to the operation list"

I'd like to know that too.

How'd you like the campaign? i loved the clean house mission
Loved it! First Cod game I played since MW2. I loved all the stealth missions
I think its a bug last time that there was a free access week this bundle was listed in game but nobody could claim it maybe its the same story

"IIRC that's just the old Frank Woods bundle that was around the cold war release.

There is a free outbreak bundle available to everyone, but it's just an m16 skin and a couple trinkets"
I think it was a pre-order bundle
I know but I didn't buy BOCW and I'm really interested by this M4A1 blueprint
it was a Exclusive item for pre ordering black Ops cold war even pre ordering the 60 dollar one would have given you it
I would really hate to see this bundle become free just for playing the game.
I'll be happy
Can you give the link to the bundle ?
https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/bundles/400587-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-free-access-w
it had me download it despite the fact I had already gotten cold war. Not sure what that was about. It kept cutting me off all evening.
Umm that�s the pre order stuff you get in mw
Those items were for preordering Cold War which is odd
Exactly. That's why I found it weird that it's registered under this free bundle also ...
wait we get this for? free? if we play the free weekend?
"This was a pre-order bonus for Cold War, I highly doubt it�ll be free for free access week"
"Idk if it is the same but i once had a similar issue. I could fix mine by rebuilding the database by pressing the Power button till it beeps 2 times. 
This issue seems to occur inconsistently and you might Need google some other methodes if mine doesnt work"
"Yeah I already did it a week back for unrelated reasons and before even trying to download the game again so don't know about that but I'm going to try it!

Yeah the thing is that I searched everywhere and there's not a single thread with a solution, but on here the last post talking about this was like 11 months ago so I tried again"
Shadow ban maybe? Not sure. This game is really buggy at the minute.
I just ran the game as administrator and was able to play one match before it started happening again
"I quite literally cannot join any match, I�ve tried a few fixes but nothing worked, I really need some help :�("
Did they fix the bug where your guns don�t get XP yet?
I�ve been trying to win the tournament for two days but I keep on getting errors and booted.
I had this problem as well and found a fix. Are you on pc?
late reply but i am!
i guess thats what you get for using the anime gun
You love to see it. Bunch of dudes banding together to help a dude out with his Damascus <3 That riotshield challenge is a bitch
I tired it and got semtexed so many times
What is the challenge you have to do for that ?
"had this once or twice, truly is the best feeling"
Many friendships have been made In the center crate on shipment
Good to see not everyone is toxic
Modern Warfare and WZ have a really shit implementation of 2x events. 2x Tiers never really worked in WZ and progression as a whole has always been bugged in this game. Sometimes you get 0xp and then you get it added a couple games later. Its just random.
Although I haven't noticed this issue specifically I have noticed that desync has been a lot worse lately
The servers in general have been terrible lately
I�ve placed a lot of shots lately and been surprised when they never landed its strange. Figured I�m missing more
"It's really bizarre. Head shots that are Armour breaks, knocks or nothing at all. And inside 250m it's minimum bullet drop"
"Definitely agree with you , I�ve just switched to the SPR for this exact reason"
I literally just did that last game a few minutes ago. And go the dub. SPR felt great
This is amusing to me because I remember people talking about the k98s tendency to mysteriously miss on target shots back in season 1 (2020). Guess nothing has improved then lol.
"Yuuup, its called silent nerfs, been doin it to the kar since day one"
I know it's a silent nerf. I play this game ALOT. But I just haven't seen any content creators talk about it being nerfed at all. But man it just doesn't feel right
"Is it actually something they did?   I have found that poor server performance is most noticeable if you single fire.

I was having fun using lever action.  I would top a kills and objectives.  Then I got thrown into a game where I shot 156 times with it.  I had 11 hits.  4 kills.  My accuracy was 7%.  This was immediately after a game where I got 27 of 30 one shit kills for mission on the shipping container map where I was actually at a disadvantage.

I tried a game of catch the money.   I died over and over to same team because I had trouble de-blueing them with kar.  Other team came and I could kill them on one shot all day."
I'm specifically talking about in warzone
"Yea they patched it the sykov and the CX and I think reset all levels for it 



They did it before with the CW street sweeper , hammer , wakazi"
Same for me. I Bought season 1 but never got to tier 100 and I really want that Mara skin so i'm praying it shows up for me all my mates have had it
"Looks like the store bug is still alive and well. 

Just for reference this has happened with the following packs:


Tacgas
Grinch Lion
Domino Rainbow
Ronin Samurai 
Roze Unmasked

In the case of the very last, Roze, after enough people brought attention to it on Twitter the devs fixed it later on in the day. To reiterate, people have had these packs show up in the store in the past month and they own them. While most of us have not even seen it once. 

What happens here is the store doesn�t show new MW packs for everyone. In fact only a select few even see them. Regions don�t matter, platforms don�t matter. There is no rhyme or reason as to why you�ll see a pack or not. In the case of Roze you had two people in the exact same region with the same platforms and one saw it while his friend didn�t. 

It�s pretty disappointing to see that even after being made aware of this issue they still haven�t fixed it. We have Iskra, Soap and Spark bundles that are left. Assuming it�s bugged with all of them they likely won�t fix any except Soap as the outrage over the bug will exceed that of Roze."
Rainbow was released?! I�ll be damned...
I saw the lion one but it didn�t even last a day
"Worst part for me is that at least in my last post, it seemed that people honestly want to silent anyone talking about this. Sure, Activision doesn't deserve a cent more, but I don't care anymore. I just want my favorite game to have my favorite Bale skin."
Did you try opening the store in the warzone screen instead of the MW screen? They were in the WZ screen for me weirdly. It has packs that don't show up elsewhere for some reason.
"yeah, I tried everything, still nothing"
"So you were able to see the season 1 vault packs?

Do you also have Cold War or the current battle pass?  I�m wondering if that makes a difference."
"Could you answer some questions (as said in other comments)? It would be very useful to diagnose what's going on ;)

- What's your region?
- Do you have Cold war? 
- Do you have the battle pass already purchased?"
Can't see them either. The Mara skin is the only one I really wanted and missed out on so this is a bummer.
Same here. Lmk if you find a solution
"Don't think there will be one without developer involvement, I've been trying everything that could give me alternative access to the shop to no avail, this might be related to player stats. Same way the 'Just for you' section is, I guess."
"Did you not see the boat? How could you be mad about about bad server quality when they added a boat tho...

For real though, it�s been super bad lately"
I had bad internet when I played paired with shit servers game was unplayable
"It�s fucking Raven, they don�t know how to manage Warzone now. I don�t necessarily think it�s sabotage, I think it�s just ineptitude. Cold War is held together by a paper clip, and now that they�re in charge of Warzone, it runs like shit too."
"I literally have spent two and a half days like a person going to work trying to win the gunfight tournament, usually after about 30 minutes of being kicked from lobbies I get in, win a game, kicked from server. 15 minutes later win two games status Rembrandt. Reset router restart game repeat. I literally just spent 5 minutes trying to load a domination lobby and it tells me canceling tournament could not connect to lobby....."
Itd be cool to get a boycott going for the next cod if this is how they treat the fan base.
"All updates does not belong to MW, they�re for Warzone and Cold War."
"The notes you read might�ve been for Warzone, not for MW. Where did you read them?"
"I read some leaks. Since there are no official patch notes for modern warfare anymore, I just assumed it was for modern warfare."
That was for cold war and warzone only
That killhouse and 3 weapons leak is for MW but they wont release it because it will take attention from cold war
When does the tournament end?
"Sunday, just like the previous two the two weekends before."
Damn that looks clean. I wish the Mk2 was remotely viable in Warzone cause it�d be fun to be a Cowboy in Verdansk
"its kinda okay because of how fast you can follow up shots like 2-3 shots its a down, only downside is its bullet drop. will use it up to 150 meters but wont use it past that. 75-100 is kinda like its sweet spot"
You should watch Aculite run it on youtube. It's viable if every bullet is a headshot
3 weeks in a row of GF Tourneys?! Pretty damn cool.
What gun is this?
Mk2 Carbine blueprint
Instantly reminded me of the song Closer to the Edge by Thirty Seconds to Mars
Congrats for the win.
"First time we get �next level� looking guns and it�s after acti killed the game off, or at least tried to"
If they made the MK2 a 1 shot headshot it would be nuts imo
Cant get this cuz i dont even get tournaments
it was scheduled to end today unfortunately
"Did you notice the audio being different in gunfight after this update? On maps like shipment and king, I normally feel like I can hear exactly where people are, but I literally got assassinated twice yesterday without hearing a sound. I assumed ""oh they crouch/ads walked at me"" but in the killcam it was full on tac sprint. Shit is so frustrating"
Maybe they had dead silence?
alright so the thing i'm impressed aboutt here (being a ps4 player) is how clear and detailed your graphics are and how fast the movement is of operators.   startin to think the ps4 version and the PC version are NOT the same game lol
turn sensitivity up
"Modern warfare is mostly. I find more sweats on hardcore modes, especially cyber and search. Warzone feels way less casual, although that might be because of SBMM."
What is SBMM?
"It's kind of casual. And by that I mean it is, but if you jump in MW right now as a new player for example you have a skill gap that looks more like a skill canyon to cross. And in that matter it's absolutely sweaty and not casual. When you have a bellow 1 KD and get slaped with people flaunting the damascus skin with a blue dot going around and quickscoping people it dosen't feel casual is what i' sayin."
"The game was made with a very casual slow mindset. Safe spaces, doors, low TTK and map design etc but it can be competitive and sweaty to an extent. Not to mention SBMM to try and help those casuals even more but that�s a different debate. I play S&D mainly and I love the sweaty ness and sometimes I don�t. Also cods skill gap is pretty low so you can easily become a great player."
If you don�t think it�s a casual game then you�re taking it too seriously. Lol it�s a game that can do both; aggressive/intense or casual. Depends on how you choose to play it.
Its much more casual than CW but not as casual as older CoDs because it has SBMM
It would be if they toned down the SBMM bullshit
It is definitely casual. On pc I also play CS GO and R6 Siege and they are ridiculously punishing and have high skill floors/ceilings.  By comparison MW was made for toddlers.
Always has been.  That's part of the franchises main appeal.
Absolutely.
"It is for shitters, if that is what you mean.  The most popular guns are that way because they are shitter easy.  Look at the mp5.  It is a laser hipfire monster.  Compare it to something like the fal that cannot hit anything even with hipfire buffs.

COD is meant to be accessible so they sell alotta copies.  This one went super hard on babby mode though.  The weapons are such a joke.  The dominant weapons are literally easy as shit to use with no drawbacks.  I do not mind them making superweapons, but the players who use them should get some type of penalty in points or something."
"wow what a dumb ass comment

SMGs are supposed to be good at hipfire, so are pistols and generally any weapon with a short barrel as they are for close range. I don't know why you're complaining that close range weapons are good at close range. 

Use the shortest barrel on the FAL. It helps the hipfire a lot, and the gun is supposed to be medium to long range so idk why you're trying to hipfire with it.

Also, all guns are usually really good at one thing, except for se which are decent at everything. I don't really understand how having each gun perform a different job mean its for ""shitters"""
Why no friez cuh??
so this is the reward for this week�s tournament hun
Yep
What is that mk2/kar98 cant tell
"Mk2, its the price from the tournament"
What
?
?
When you pointed into the air... I waited......I waited to see if the spray of gun fire exploded and the 360 spinning unleashed but no....it wasnt a Damascus celebration this time.....
Witch skin I didn�t see you look at any
What�s your loadout?
Gimme the gun loadout ples
I love seeing an old school montage. Hits you right in the feels lol
thanks bro
finally an actual good montage for mw
thanks so much bro!
had to shake off some rust to get these clips but it would be dope to get the edit community going again!
"I know this is a bit late, but same here. (regardless of loadout)

I have an Ryzen 5 3800x, 16GB RAM, 850w PSU, running on a PCIe NVMe SSD, with an Nvidia 3080."
"Yeah still have it, I've learned to just open the menu with esc and it goes away for maybe a minute or so but comes back if I use dead silence.

I kinda just ignore it now"
It was doing this for me as well
if only they actually made the games unique instead of copy and pasting features this wouldn�t be a problem
happened to me to but there gone now:/
"You can even put on the Cold War stickers in mw, the only difference is that the charms don�t show up"
stickers show up charms do do it while you can
"I love thermite, especially when it's used to murder those with a riot shield."
"Is killing someone in war considered murder? Ive never thought of it that way but now you said it, it definitely seems like murder"
If you want an alternative you could replace your underbarrel of your rife with a thermite grenade launcher. Does the same thing.
They're just parts of cold war. Don't need them if you're not going to play them
"So, it's just game data without a ""key""?"
The mask is the signature of sweats
Yup
Or the gimp suit
"I respect your opinion, but the mask looks terrible"
For real? I think it looks pretty dope. Bullet resistant masks are pretty rare and the other one looks like a gimp mask lol
"I think the mask looks cool, it�s just that she doesn�t have any equally bulky armour on the body, just a jumpsuit and a few pads here and there. Makes her look like a bobble head"
"The rook skin mask gives me nightmares, the eyes, blankly staring into my soul and the mouth with no movement at all"
"Boba Fett-lite

Roze is just a dumb operator tbh. Boba Fett, gimp suit or this"
Those airframe chops are the coolest thing in the game
"THANK YOU

thanks for proving my point"
She�s not that bad
"fun fact: this is Rose's voice actress irl   
[http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/persons/573161/573161\_v9\_bb.jpg](http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/persons/573161/573161_v9_bb.jpg)"
I agree.... don�t see the problem here
Person she�s based on looks way more attractive though
She looks pretty good IMO.
Bro shes a badass
Yeah it�s nice to have some transgender content
"No, take the mask off. At least we can fucking see her now."
"Hey, wyatt is a fuckin chad..."
Wyatt gang
Wyatt is based. Absolute proper bloke
"We really gonna deny the fact that they made Alex Zedra look 47 years old? 

This operator is gorgeous and yall clearly haven't seen women."
What redditor has?
"Yeah I said the same thing about Mara, it�s outrageous, she looks way worse and older than the model they used."
Alex Zedra made herself look 47. She�s a waste.
torn veil skin doesn't look bad in game tbh
I don't get you guys. I think she's the best looking female operator we have now lol.
"It�s not that she�s ugly or anything of the sort, she just looks off."
Iskra and the blue pants don't do it for ya?
She�s not a bad lookin bloke
Why does nobody like Dominique lol
"There is something off about her like she is dead, it kinda exists with mara as well, they're the only ops off the top of my head that look like this"
Am I the only one who likes her mask and her unmasked look?
"I�m a big fan off both looks. I like all of the roze skins. I don�t use the all black one anymore since nearly everyone in WZ uses it. 

I hope to see Roze return in MW2. Maybe as a base operator? But I�ll take her as a future battle pass operator too."
"She looks fine?  Im always impressed with how good hair looks in this game, that was the first thing I noticed with Roze�s new skin. I think all the operators look cool."
Looks fine to me. The mask is what looks weird.
Yall weird.
"I think her face suffers from the same thing mara�s face suffered, which was a poor scan and modeling

Dont get me wrong they both look fine but it certainly hits a uncanny valley when looking at roze and the face for mara just does not compare to alex zedra"
"Not sure why IW left the face paint off, it's on her face in the bundles emblem and calling card. Hmmm"
She looks like Adam Driver.
To each their own I guess.
I like a woman with prominent facial features
*bonk*
Relax
Anyone else thinks she looks like Adam driver? That�s probably sounds really weird but look at her
[deleted]
Thanks bro
"Nice clip, man! Ignore the haters."
Thanks bro
Damn that was awesome
Thanks bro

Price and kreuger
Now try it with a gun that takes skill
like the spr or kar98? already done
"The DLC weapons were weapons added after release of the game. 

This includes: 

For ARs:Ram, Grau, AMAX, AN-94, AS-Val

SMGs: Striker 45, Fennecc, ISO

Shotguns: VLK Rogue, Jak-12

LMGs: Holger-26, Bruen, Finn

Marksmans: Crossbow, SKS, SPR

Snipers: Rytec

Handguns: Renetti

Melee: Kali sticks, Dual Kodachis

These are all the DLC weapons in the game, so if you�re speed running Damascus, you don�t need these."
Anything that wasn�t in the game at launch. So the ram 7 and newer
I�m somewhat sure dlc litteraly just means downloadable content so in that sense then the seasonal guns would be considered dlc (at least I think)
"Well, you're not wrong, but at this point DLCs are mostly paid expansions such as map packs in most CoDs before MW."

gravity flipped for a second lol
Great save with the buy back
I should add it all works fine on my phone and mobile apps but the desktop version of the site doesn't work
Shipment. All I can say is shipment..... just put a shield on your back and the perk that makes you run super fast then run round like a crackead and kill em. It�s literally just shipment
I feel like 50 point blank kills is a little bit excessive. I feel like 20-25 would be more fair. Im sure it will get easier once I get the Model 680/725 out of the way. It�s my final category before Damasacus so I�m pretty exited and motivated.
Shoot the ship only run shotguns and it will come to you. As a damascus owner I would advise going for other challenges because over time you will get them passively as you play. Remember shoot the ship or shipment 24 7 if they got it. Good luck
It�s currently been on for 2 weeks so shoot the ship is your best friend.
"These guys are gonna say shipment, and they aren�t wrong, it�s the most efficient way. 

But if you�re a stealthy tactical player like me, play search and destroy and sneak up on people. Or play ground war and sneak up on snipers! That�s my preferred method! This also works for riot shield challenges."
Slide with dead silence on shippment and put your barrel in the nads.
"Stun grenades, riot shield, amped perk, shipment. Trust me this�ll work easilly"
"I like this, I�ll give it a try, thank you!"
"honestly, any hardcore map work, you just gotta be that guy to camp with your shotgun close to angles, and then just shoot first, i find on shoothouse camping in the office near the doors can guarantee 10 a game"
Song name?

"Welcome to CoD. S1st D1st has been a part of CoD for over a decade. Shit servers and even shittier netcode can cause it.

Also, I've noticed I only start having S1st D1st after a few good games so S3MM could well be a factor also."
"Only in Verdansk, if I go into rebirth I don�t have this isssue and the same on MW, 6 months ago I would go around the lobby with a car and kill everyone, now I need to be sweaty against bots so I wouldn�t die."
"There are a few things that can constitute to this problem. 

1. Is your TV in �game� mode? Try switching TV modes and see which one has the least delay. 

2. Wireless controllers with microphones can cause latency.

3. Are you focusing on your recoil control? I used to get very angry, as I would ALWAYS shoot first and hit them first, but end up losing the gunfight. Turns out, I wasn�t focusing on aiming and recoil control, which meant while I hit my first shot, I barely hit any follow up shots. 

4. Are you connected via WiFi or Ethernet? Those milliseconds can add up.

Hope these help! Try turning off aim assist if you think your aim may be the problem. It will suck for a few days but then you will become Xbox god"
"Nah it�s not my aim, I can�t even miss if I miss I�m for sure dead, my aim is really good that�s my issue even when I�m shooting right on target with all hit marks I might die first."
"I�m using a 1 ms monitor, Ethernet connected, great aim great recoil control, obviously terrible advice to turn off aim assist but it�s not that."
Same situation...im on the ps4 an i believe i fixed what you are talking about by cutting out the controller..im on mouse n keyboard now and huge difference that .5 advantage they had is gone im thinking the wireless controller with mic will slow you down...
"I use astros so I�m connecting my headset to console with usb, I have no issues in other game modes Mw or even rebirth, every rebirth game I go in I get 10+ kills even if I�m running alone with other teammates on the other side of the map, over 3.4+ KD in that mode. It�s not only about stats in other game modes I feel like I have complete control over my actions and results don�t feel frustrating"
Try the mouse n keyboard you will see
"New to the franchise? This is a staple of the series, but nowhere has it ever been quite as apparent as in mw19."
"Nah I�ve been here since cod 4, Warzone is just broken for me"
I say these ladders are cursed. It's amazing how we often can't climb 30cm high walls and are not able to jump down these ladders
so many times you cant even get on the ladders properly. they�re so shit
Preach it
Jesus man I can't believe someone did a range card for this
Where�s the quick scope card? I need to know the lead and drop for the 0-10m range.
Why measure distance in yards when in game it�s measured in metres
USA? USA...
Supreme nerd activity.
Nice camera quality

Definitely not. Could only be unlocked during season 5 BP
No for sure answer people think March 11 the anniversary of warzone
If I'm not mistaken a reputable leaker said sometime near march 11
"No word yet from Activision,,,perhaps it is the end for MW."
amogus
"Yeah I lost a decent amount of cod points last year during MW and contacted Activision support, it did take them a little while to get back to me but the woman that helped get them back was VERY helpful and stayed in contact w me during the entire process. Hopefully you guys will get the same help"
"Good to hear that there's hope - and I don't doubt that costumer service is kind and all, but just seems like they're highly understaffed."
Did you get it back? I lost 4000 CPs if you look at my post history
"Lol i also wasn't able to contact them for 2 days already, will try today again at the exact time they start working"
I'll cross my fingers that you'll be able to get in touch with costumer service - seems like it requires some persistence.
have you looked in the app? you can buy stuff from it
"cod companion app? I haven't, I will check now, thanks"
Holy shit I didn�t know that. Thanks!
It doesn't have all bundles right? I checked it and only few are there.
Nah you gotta be lucky for those ones

Can't be arsed with the grind
"I love how Damascus looks but I'm not that good, so I'm going to stick to just fully leveling up my guns"
"Trust me, it just takes time. I'm dog shit at the game but I got Damascus. Skill helps, but patience is key."
As i know of i still have it but i have not played modern warfare in a couple months
I really don't like the Damascus design especially the wierd ass colours so I'm probably not gonna get it.
I think Damascus is kind of ugly. Plat and Obsidian for me only.
Same but im still gonna complete mw before moving to cold war
"I hate damascus, it reminds me so much of 12 years old who play forkids."
I only have ~~Damascus~~ Obsidian for the knife and I got it because of my play style apparently. I could care less about camo challenges honestly.
Damascus only for the knife? What?
Still have LMG's. Shotguns and pistols and launchers left
No. I did however have some toxic guy in search watching me (my own teammate) slagging me off as I was the last one alive saying we had no chance as I didn�t have Damascus.
I've got plat on all the primary guns but still need most secondaries.
R.I.P to those 7 people with account issues
I have everything plat except the launchers and riot shield. I gave up trying when I saw riot shield's requirements. Completely dumb.
"It used to be worse. If you want advice, I'd say exclusively play hard-core. It only took me a week or so of casual playing, but it's definitely a grind"
Yeah and I regret putting myself through it but at least I get called a no life sweat in SnD now lmao
"Bow, Sticks, Sword left for Gold, 16 Obsidians ... JOKR@moment, knife for Obsidian too? i m not sure. After the grind i know i m bad at all except SCAR xD"
"I have Damascus, and obsidian for some weapons."
"If you were hacking, the switch from one target to the other would have been more on point as it literally locks on to the next target. Your ads sensitivity is pretty high and you�ve got skills no doubt!"
My new favorite thing to do is just flick my mouse in a random direction in SnD for every killcam. Most of the time people will just accuse you of cheating even though you're shooting at a building that isn't even accessible.
I always take it as a compliment as they're basically saying my aim is as good as people using aimbot
100% the only time is when i see people i look up to like mpcontrolward for example get extensive hate where it seeps into people spamming dislikes on videos etc but other than that its pure dopamine :)
I can tell someone's been practicing target switching routines :) Something about that style of aiming just makes people jump immediately to accusations.
How much fucking force does you character throw that with so that it has enough power to ricochet off a brick wall and still have enough force to stab someone
This^ the most unrealistic physics youd ever see...
And if the knife hits their pinky toe it kills them..
All of the knives are vibranium
Josh Allen type force
But then the second I throw a frag or a stun/flash it somehow bounces directly back to where it was thrown.
How much you wanna bet I can throw a knife over them mountains?

Was this intentional??
I wanted to try to bounce it off the wall cause I knew there was a dude there. I guess I got lucky and chose the correct angle of incidence
Surprised some trophy system 30 feet away didn't snag it..
Remember when trophies blocked entire fucking predator missiles?
"fkin impressive shot!!

also thanks for reminding me why I never turned on subtitles for in-game bot chat. that shit looks distracting af"
It can actually be helpful. Sometimes you get subtitles from enemies you cant see/hear so you know theyre close by.
"It�s honestly not that bad, you kinda get used to it"
Someone got an A in geometry class
Or physics of spheres bouncing off perfectly flat plains
In the containers on shipment throwing knives bounce alot. Its a great way to kill somebody camping in there.
Haven�t seen anything like this since MW2/BO2. Nice

Lol
Nice
Never seen this before... someone playing online with subtitles!
"Huh. 

Never thought about it. I mean, I don't notice them at all but apparently some people do."
Maximum info
It's so satisfying to do that LOL. I've surprised a few people by doing similar while running a Crossbow and throwing knives. Good fun.
Nice!
"Nice shot! Tip: on the same map, you can do this from the window to get guys coming between wall and containers. You don�t even have to put that much into I�m aiming."
�Calculating... calculating... Target acquired.�
"This is odd. Now lm also able to apply CW stickers to MW guns. It also shows all charms but they dont render. My MW menus also have this blue theme so lm guessing this is some cache bug. I wonder what will happen to these saved blueprints l made with CW stickers.

But once more. Totally artificial restriction regarding the watches and stickers. Why not just share them?"
"I don't think it comes from the cache. The first time you boot up MW, it will have the Warzone theme on (mostly grey everywhere and the menu tabs are white, just like it was before this update) and you won't be able to see the CW stickers and charms... But if you enter and exit a lobby (and if you finish a match too) then everything you just said comes to be (blue theme, CW stickers and charms)."
"They made cw cosmetics into mw engine for wz, of course the restrictions are artificial"
"There�s a caveat �otherwise stated� for allowance of what game it�s in. Obviously, if a CW item is in warzone it should be able to render in MW. The problem is more so weapons since the slots don�t include perks in CW."
You use too many abbreviations
I got the mg34 i dont remeber the name but it's gold and black and the current skin is like a white carbine
Do you know how can I find its name?
Woukd also be interested in a picture of the carabiner
Me too :(
"Hey there, the blueprint is called GOLD STAR. Have a nice day :)"
Thank you man you too :)
If you go to the mg34 next to it their should be a blueprint icon and if u click the icon you'll see it
I do not own it so is it possible to not see?
You best opinion is shoot the ship and do it on shoot house
Do you have 76Hz enabled in your display settings on the desktop?
Yeah
 What is overclocked?
My Monitor
Now now you must understand that Activision has abandoned MW a long time ago...
Activision doesn't want people to see how crappy MW / Warzone servers are :P
They won't be any better in CW. Bet its the same server banks for both games.
How do you get there in Cw?
Go into Settings the. The Account and Network tab. Click connection quality.
"If this could be added to MW it would make reporting which servers are having issues easier.

Rather then sending via DM's on twitter to Activision a ton of Diagnostic results i could simply say like in this case please could you check eu-west-6 and eu-west-2 for issues as i am seeing packet loss on them servers or even better i could just send them this screenshot.

&#x200B;

Now if MW and CW servers are running on the same set of cloud provided servers it could explain why i am seeing packet loss on some rounds and not others which means yep its their end not ours."
Lol. The network engineers already have this data and are well aware when packet loss and congestion is happening. This must just be within the limits of their SLA with Activision.
Activision won't do anything to support their most community supported game anymore which is really really sad
Cus Cold War is better
"It isn't better to be honest, it just has to one up MW this includes packet loss and for my first time ever adds connection interrupts to the mix too.

They really have to sort the servers out for both games."
It�s about as large as a box of obese turtles
Thats gotta be the best description that I have ever read.
"If you delete Spec Ops and Survival Packs, it might."
"So with everything installed, it's still more than 200GB?"
How much is it without?
"Everything installed, mine was like 212 gb I think."
"as a ps4 player there's a ton of room you can ""free up"" by not installing all the other shit, if you don't play it or need it.   according to ""storage"" my copy of MW takes up 171.2 GB

I only have 5 packs installed.  

I've still got room on my drive and two other games :)"
What system?

"Honestly the closes I can probably think of is BattleField. 

Unfortunately BF1 (2016) & BF5 (2018) although both being great games... are set in older times of the world wars. 

BF4 (2013) would probably be the closest but it�s a older game. Still very active though. So maybe check it out. 

BF: Hardline would also be decent, not sure how many people are actually still playing it tough . 

BF6 set to release in late 2021 is going to be a treat for a modern next generation shooter."
"I think I'll try the BF4, thanks for suggestion mate! Honestly I really love to play with weapons, which has attention to detail. That's why I played CoD, because of the glorious **GUNSMITH**. But on the other hand, seems like BF4 has really big arsenal of different weapons."
insurgency sandstorm or red orchestra 2 either the regular game or rising storm
I played the Rising Storm and it was... Meh...

"I'm trying to look for alternatives too, but I just can't seem to find one yet"
"Ironsight seems good, but I hate Steam, haha (I had really bad experience in the past). Now I'm still rolling the MW, but sometimes I switch to Battlefield 1. But the Battlefield is just not as good as CoD in some things."
"Agree - I love MW but its probably my first and last COD. I vote with my wallet - against scummy Acti.

BF 3 is still active. Check Venus Unleashed project.

Insurgency Sandstorm - also active.

ARMA III has stable community but its different animal than standard MP shooter."
"I know, the ARMA is something like Project Reality. It's time consuming and most of the time boring, not mine taste. It would be actually more fun to join real voluntary army, which I'm planning to anyway~

And yes, first CoD and probably the last CoD of myself too."

"I would like to, but I don't know which game, that's why I'm asking here..."
If your launching from Cold War I think it�s just a blanket screen everyone gets wether you own the game or not.
Says the same on mine even though I own the full game
"Thanks for the feedback, good to know it�s there for others, seems a bit daft though. 
Cheers every one and stay frosty."
"If you have opened cold war and not mw it says that.  

I guess they did it to make it clear for people"
"Depends on what you want from your other perks. I mainly play S&D and use double time to get to places faster off spawn in perk 1, with quickfix as my first specialist perk as it activates the second you kill someone. Outside of that, I can�t think of a situation where I�d rather have hardline over ghost or restock, personally. It�s up to you."
"This isn't that related, but a fun thing I noticed is having shrapnel as a specialist perk instantly gives you the extra grenade when you unlock it. So you can run hardline as the perk 2 then use specialist shrapnel as a replacement for Restock. Kinda niche but it's good for explosive oriented classes where you want amped to throw semtex faster/switch to rockets, and shrapnel is good to keep EOD users health low for longer (assuming they don't stim). I've had times where I've thrown a semtex onto a point to get a kill and injure some EOD users, then shrapnel instantly gives me another to throw to finish them off

My cancerous Hardpoint class is EOD/Hardline/Amped with Shrapnel, Restock and Tune Up.  AR with underbarrel grenade launcher (surprisingly useful for attacking buildings), semtex, snapshot grenades, RPG and Munitions Box. It's ridiculous but works really well on maps like Cheshire park."
"You can either use it as your default perk, meaning 1 kill will get you your first perk, or use it as your last perk so the specialist bonus is only 1 more kill instead of 2"
"Thank you!

So if we consider Hardline to not count as a 'real' perk, is the following correct?

Without Hardline: start with 3 perks, 4 perks at 2 kills, 5 perks at 4 kills, 6 perks at 6 kills, all perks at 8 kills

With Hardline: start with 2 perks, 3 perks at 1 kill, 4 perks at 3 kills, 5 perks at 5 kills, all perks at 7 kills

If I am correct then this means Hardline is only usefull if you can reliably get 7 kills?"
"having hardline as your default perk and quick fix as your first specialist perk is a great agressive setup, because it works like you always have quick fix, but you can also have another blue perk, mainly EOD"
EOD + Quick Fix is a godsend for HP/Dom. Being on an objective doubles health regen speed so if you get grenaded you're back to full health in 2 seconds. I like it because it frees up my secondary to be stuns or snapshots
"Use it as perk 6 (last perk in the streak). Hardline essentially means you're operating on one less perk. If you start with hardline as perk 2 then you're down a perk each time you spawn in. If you're someone who is aiming for specialist then it's best to have it as the last perk, that way you have 5 perks by kill 4, then by the time you get to kill 6 it doesn't really matter that you're not really gaining anything, as it now only takes 1 more kill to get ALL perks

Having said that you could run Hardline as a perk 2 if you aren't bothered about the other perk 2 and you aren't aiming for Specialist bonus every time. For example if you run EOD + Hardline with Quick Fix as the first unlock, youll get Quick Fix after kill 1 and it activates instantly, so it's essentially like running Quick Fix + EOD

Also sometimes I like running Hardline + Amped, with Shrapnel as first unlock. Shrapnel actually gives you the second explosive for free when you unlock it, so if kill 1 is a grenade kill then you get the grenade back instantly. For explosive-focused classes, having both Amped + Shrapnel is a massive help. Shrapnel affects all explosives including RPG, so Shrapnel + Amped is giving you faster equipment use and rocket reload combined with the heath regen effect of Shrapnel"
"i think you'r right, i always set hl, if you cant get that 1st kill, specialist has no benefits anyway"
WTF are they even saying?

"I was having this issue just a few days ago and what corrected it was resetting my overclock. The MW engine is super finicky and so while an oc might seem stable on stuff like kombuster, it is not in MW. My solution again was resetting clock speeds and finding a stable oc the game was able to handle."
"For me, lowering the GPU clocks didn�t work. 

I had to up the stock voltage. After playing with it, I am able to run a considerable overclock stable @ 1.2V"
i dont really think that overclocking would work
I think that�s a new weapon that will come to cold war and warzone but I�m not sure
aww
Its not a blueprint its the cold war crossbow which releases with mid season update
why are they promoting these weapons when the game i'm launching is MW. it can be very misleading
I feel like it�s gonna be a mid season drop like maxis the dude holding the mini gun and the girl holding the cross bow. But I could be wrong.
There�s a bundle on cod tracker with a crossbow blueprint I�m pretty sure it�s that one
I try so this and then remember everyone is either camping a corner or bunny hopping corners. Btw what sensitivity are you playing on?
mouse and keyboard on xbox which makes it all wonky so i have no idea
"Call of Duty know exactly what they are doing with the file sizes, it has now become a major problem for anyone on console older or next Gen. 

It seems to me that they are pushing the file sizes bigger and bigger to make us one by one uninstall the data packs on Modern Warfare, therefore only keeping CW and Warzone. 

Things that have led me to believe this is not only this Subreddit pointing out the obvious things like Playlist changes but also what CW is doing, they have let Xbox Turn cross play off (somthing I personally wanted in warzone) CW even allows you to change FOV on Console.... I mean this should of been in MW on the same update surly?? 

Mix all of that with having to slowly remove the Campaign data pack then Spec Op's and inevitably Multiplayer down the line, it feels like that time Apple purposely slowed down the iPhone to make you upgrade you know. 

Also a little bit of context I love warzone and I like to level guns up on CW MP (it's a fun little thing for me to do on an evening) Im also getting back into Zombies so I wouldn't like to uninstall CW before you mention it. 



Anyway that's my take on this and it's really pissing me off as I strongly Believe MW is better than CW."

"This level of desperation shows just how badly CW BP1 has gone and they are not making close to the same amount of cash as they did in MW.

Reactive camos and zombies is the bees knees tho
"For their own game, sure. But don�t put them in a realistic style FPS game like MW is all I�m saying. Zombies and reactive camos don�t have a place in a game like that."
War zone is its own title. Every year the new COD guns and skins will be added.
Notice how I said BLACK OPS needs to be it�s own title and not warzone? I know warzone is it�s own game.
Throwing knife to the knee for you sir
If you disagree with me tell me why.
"Agreed, but also, MW WAS realistic, until the stupid skins, lasers that disintegrate people, skins that make it look like you�re running round fucking Disney world on an acid trip, etc. Such a shame as the game was great."
"100% agree with you. I hate that I paid $60 for this game for the realism and tacticle gameplay, yet it�s somehow turned into The twelfth installment of black ops zombies."

Just gets boring playing with the same ol guns. That�s what made me start the grind up for damascus

"MW camos were super easy to get, I had all of them done except for shield and launchers within like 2 months of the game releasing, and I wasnt even playing that often"
"Just a bit of friendly advice, ensure you activate two factor authentication - lots of accounts that get Damascus are hacked and Activision do very little to help get it back"
Happened to me and it took a month and a half to get it back
I'm part of both the Damascus club and the got hacked club. Lucky enough I got my account back in 2 weeks. Lots of stories of people less fortunate. It really does paint a target on your back for hacking.
I still haven�t go my account back and it�s been a month
"I was a member for a month. Then I was permanently banned for no reason at all, lmfao. I might go for it again but it�s a catastrophically long grind lol"
"Damn. F. That's my biggest fear though, that someone might think I'm cheating and report me."
I was and then my account got compromised and Activision didn�t do shit about it
How long did it take? Congrats btw
"Hard to say. I started doing camo challenges for my most used weapons just randomly but finally decided to buckle down and go for it about a month ago. I was hesitant for awhile because I thought it would take too long, but it didn't occur to me to play hardcore until I decided I was actually going to grind for damascus. Playing hardcore made all the difference and a lot of time was spent in Ground War for launcher camos."
"I just got platinum the other day on SMG, currently slogging my way through AR�s at the mo, have M4, Grau, fal & ram7 AMAX in progress

Also nice work"
"If you go for damascus, you don't need the RAM-7 and AMAX for it. Nor do you need them to get platinum."
"Working on AR�s right now too. Got the Kilo, M4, Scar, FAL, and CR done so far. I�ll have the FR 556 done today as well. I gained some new appreciation for the Scar while using it. Which one do you like better, Grau or RAM7?"
Nice! Hope you had fun and only suffered minor brain damage on your Damascus quest
"This is me rn. 2 away from it and it's messing with me seeing someone else's rocket swoop in and take down kill streaks

They should have some sort of message sent to everyone in the lobby when someone gets damascus
Now to get Damascus on all the DLC weapons! Lol
"Fuck that lol, I�m only doing a few that I enjoy using, then I�m pushing for Obsidian with my favorites"
it's not possible
Oh i see a AAA game is bad so not worth buying thanks!

"It�s actually crazy how the HDR, which fills the archetype of the �heavy� sniper,  is faster than the fastest sniper in black ops Cold War. Treyarch did everyone dirty this year  by Increasing ads and reducing flinch. People can go on and on about how modern warfare �encourages camping� but at least an average player could run around with snipers in mw. In Cold War you either need to be a quickscoping god or a camper for snipers to be viable"
Misread ads and didn�t even question them having added advertisements to a full price game :/
Actually with this new update it seems like they�ve buffed the snipers in cold now .
"nah man quickscoping is sooo much easier in CW, yes the ADS is slower (better in season 2 though) the reduced flinch and higher ttk is so much more forgiving i find"
The Type and DMR almost negate the need for a sniper rifle too.
"It's affecting almost everyone! I try keep an eye on here to see if anyone's found any workarounds

Me and my brother try to play splitscreen on my one s but it crashes when loading the level
"Agree, on Xbox, crashes most after loading level..."
Wish it wasn�t true but I doubt they�ll even fix it. They have a habit of leaving bugs in modes they don�t play. Like spec ops that�s had an FOV bug since January of last year.
"Same here this is ridiculous, Activision need to fix this, it is game breaking for the 10 people still playing splitscreen.

"You can find the cx-9 out of chests in warzone, not sure about the sykov. They both should come out March 11 but I'm not sure"
Why march 11?
How are you running so fast? My game never moves that fast
I play on a computer and my POV is set to 100 so it makes it look like I�m moving a lot faster than at 80 POV.
That the mp5 is still an absolute MACHINE
Yeah I love the mp5 for close quarter maps. Mp7 for medium maps and m4 for big maps.

"Same, scan and repair was useless. I did, however, uninstall the campaign, spec ops and survival and the numbers went down A LITTLE, but it's still bad."
Damn!
I get this every time I press the home button to invite friends or just leave the app
"Why does K/D even matter tho? Just enjoy the game.

Damascus grind IS NOT fun tho..."
"I have a .98 I�m 121 kills under being even imo anything around 1 is good means you kill more then you die or about even but you know ppl who have a 2.37 gotta flex there big pecker and tell you If your not 5,000 kills over positive your trash"
kd means almost nothing if the person who brags about it got it with spamming streaks and playing super defensively. i have a 1.3 kd but im almost always top score by rushing constantly and i barely use streaks
"OMG people complaining about having a 1 or .99 K/D. I would give my left nut for that. I think I am rocking a .8 or some bullshit like that. I just play to have fun and usually have a few good games above 1 K/D and then turn into someone's prison bitch and spend the rest of my night taking it dry, right up main street."
"Kd is irrelevant. I play hardcore and don�t use the low level kill streaks since they are hard to control. If i don�t get a VTOL, my kd is usually around .6. If i get 1 or 2 of my streaks, my kd for the game will be 3-4. 

See what i mean about how kd is irrelevant in the big scheme of things?"
If you got a big willie you can be on my team!

The campaign is really good and the multiplayer should definitely be active for the next several years.
The campaign is really good and the multiplayer should definitely be active for the next several years.
"The game is definitely different from Cold War, and a lot of people hate it. It's not really the arcadey style that COD has been before. It's worth a try, you'll either love it or you'll hate it.

The game is just as active as Cold War, if not more."
"This games a reboot of there older modern warfare games, so it has a different story. Multiplayer is still very active, even more active than cold war mp. Co-op is okay, some people find it boring. If you do get it just know that the average ttk is noticeably faster than cw�s."
"Be warned, the game will need it's own drive. It's over 240GB  
It's call of duty. There's cross play. If your buddies are on console they will be able to play with you.  


Not much else to say,"
"I don�t plan on playing warzone and I heard it installs with it, if I don�t install warzone with it will it drop some out? I have over 400gb on my HDD and 200 something on my SSD."
[deleted]
"Oh, what are those?"
"Its because of the new season 1 ""Vault"" packs they released. So now you gotta buy the vault pack for said original operator and it includes the missions for the skin variants. It's another bs move for more money. I was currently only a few days ago working on the missions for Rodion, wasn't far off getting the final skin, logged on the next day to finish and it's not there. I check on reddit and see people posting about release of vault packs in the store, yh kinda shitty see as I paid for the battle pass that season and they just taken away the operator missions to resell them. ****s"
Make sure your Ethernet is plugged in and also you have the right region selected for servers.
"Same issue here, happened since yesterday for me but about 11 am i can play it until night, now this mornig trying to play again got kicked several times"
I've had this issue twice the first time resetting my console fixed ut but the 2nd time I had to reinstall everything and open my xbox ports
I'm on PC as well and I haven't been able to join a game since the Season 2 update.
"Nikto was the only operator I ever bought. I had the one with the red accents, never used anything other than that and UDT ghost"
Saaaaaame bro that�s the coolest Nikto skin
You mean the Scuba one ? not the �please headshot me here � red face plate one right ?
The blue laser kilo is the best blueprint in the game and the nikto bundles are some of the best microtransactions actually worth buying. Nikto is just a straight up G
I love the velikan bundle because it got shadow tracer on 2 weapons I love and the skins is awesome I jsut hate that he�s mute
Uh what? I�m confused
"The fucking disc does not have the singleplayer game. It just has 30 gb or something of assets. You have to download all that shit to play the singleplayer. I preordered the collectors edition and had a bad awakening when I had to download 65 gb for the single and multiplayer before I could play anything.

I was so pissed. They punish disc buyers."
"I have searched the internet to find a simple solution to the issue I keep having.

So many people have had the same problem.  Likely thousands.

I don't want to fucking play Warzone.  Why are they combining a Free to Play game with my disc purchase anyway?  And it takes up a ton of space, but when I go to try and manage storage, I'm stuck with only the option of deleting the single player, or MW MP...

>They punish disc buyers.

This makes me insane.  I buy discs because they can be resold, or more likely, lent to friends.  AND, I don't trust the 'system'.  Just look at all those people who lost their entire Oculus libraries because Facebook decided they were frauds.  

I want to own the actual game, not own 'the rights to play it until something changes'.


And finally, fuck the fact that every single game needs downloads.  I moved into a new house, no internet yet, and found out that having no internet meant I couldn't play single player in two of my games.

And when I bought my current xbox one, instead of being excited and getting to play a game, I was left spending 30 mins setting up the network, and then 4 hours downloading RDR2 (even though I had discs, 2 in fact...)

So, sorry for the rant, but its some bullshit."
"im not sure if this is what your issue is but the Modern Warfare disc will load you to a launcher that then lets you load Warzone or Modern Warfare, even though it looks like it's loading up warzone."
"Yes, that is my issue.

It pisses me off.

It also gives me the option of buying Cold War.  


I didn't buy a disc game to be pushed into buying another game.  And i dont appreciate them shoving their F2P game down my throat. They don't do it to be helpful, they do it because they know some 12 year olds will snatch moms credit card to buy some asinine 'skins', which are the worst thing to happen to gaming in a long time."
"It has only done that 3 out of some 20 odd times.

I am aware of that screen (since it also tries to sell me Cold War!), but most times it gives me some BS about a download, etc.

Not sure why it makes sense for them to combine them in this way any-who."
I get where they're comming from  i tried warzone and honestly dont see the point in it  but i whole free to play game i dont want taking up 100gb to play a game i paid for
Bro check you have the content from the disc installed that's why it won't let you play
"I do have it installed.  I have a ton of *IT* installed.

I am able to play the game, and have actually beaten it already.

But the issue is half the times I try to access Single player campaign, I can't.  I just keep getting Warzone screens.  

The times when it does work, I have to click on a screen that says just Warzone (and start), and then I get to a screen that gives me the option of Cold War (*buy*), Warzone, or Modern Warfare. 

But I don't always get that screen.

I'm not an idiot.  I just don't understand when I buy a simple disc, I end up being forced to download other stuff, and then they try to sell me a whole different game, all while making the UI and screens confusing.

What happened to putting in the disc and pressing start?"

Ik it�s my fav deff wish the games were longer as it�s prob the best time I have on that game
I wish I got shipment instead of shoot house all the damn time
I just started running specialist bonus on all my classes now can you give me a rundown on what you use?
"Love bringing out the hipfire mp5 in shipment and shoothouse, it�s just so good. My first gold gun."
What are the attachments?
Loadout???
Does anyone know how to fix this error? It appeared after season 2 update and I haven�t been able to open MW
this game is old now of course its broken you gotta get black ops cold war now cuz its the new one or wait till cod 2021 and get that cuz then black ops cold war will be the old dead game
Normal for gf. It's not 6v6.  Gf seems to allow for more extremes
The short TTK in this game makes the netcode issues a lot more noticeable. Lots of one frame deaths.
Or getting pixeled over clipping issues...bopp i mean headglitching.
Dude I literally can�t even get into the fucking tournament. It keeps breaking up my party. WTF IS GOING ON
"Issue since day 1. Not enough people kicked up stink about it, so one year later it's the same. I'd say speak with your wallet but we all know everyone will buy the next CoD regardless of quality.p"
"You ever think that maybe you�re just bad, I can�t tell you a single time I�ve ever had a �net code issue� you people talk about and it just seems like you�re just blaming something else"
"MP7 has always been good, even back to MW3. it�s the only gun i have obsidian for."
I've pretty much run AX-50/MP7 since day one. MP7 is able to zip from such a long range while staying accurate. Saves AR ammo for my teammates too.
The MP7 has been my go to for most of time. Even over the MP5. But I�m also fairly trash at this game so.....
I loved the MP7 in this game. I already got Obsidian and I guess it's the only one I'll have with this camo.
Its a beast. I've got a loadout with it as my main gun.
What�s the set up?
"I probably feel a little sore about this in the moment, as I just got rinsed by a cheater with an MP7. Motherfucker followed me around the map, tracking me through walls, mid-air aimbotting, and beelining to me even when I was opposite EVERYONE ELSE on both teams. 

(Thank you for your patience with my rant.)

But yes, it does seem like the MP7 has come back en vogue again. Lots of folks using it, and most are using it cleanly and way too well for my skill level."
I want to like the mp7 so bad but I play so much better with the mp5 up close and find the mp7 killing too slow out to mid range despite the excellent recoil
Hmmm my games are ok mostly because of my mediocore k/d. Everyone in my lobbys use unique guns cuztomized to their liking with some meta users here and there. I think its because of sbmm and how good you are since the mp7 is a sweaty tryhard weapon
"MP7 is really nice. Just an all around solid gun to use. Third gun I got obsidian for. 

With that said, it heavily struggles against the top guns. Amax, SPR, Fal, Val, or Model will drop an MP7 first almost every single time - assuming there�s not a large skill gap present."
It's always been fairly good but it seemed really good last night when i used it. Idk maybe there was a stealth buff for WZ that bled over to MW lately.
"60rounds with a normal TTK, it is popular for SMGs. But VAL still broken..."
Idk but I've used it for 6 months as a main and it doesn't let me down
What�s the set up?
"Bruh, idk. I still find the mp5 to be better in the realm of ttk and damage per bullet."
"It is without a doubt but at the moment even with mp5 I get slaughtered by MP7s.

And not just me. Nearly every play of the game I see is MP7 slicing through swathes of enemies with a couple of bullets on each.

When I use it I struggle to take down more than 2 or 3 with a 60 round mag.

This fucking game still infuriates me.

100+ meg ethernet and I'm still handicapped by lag or the SBMM so called ""skill based"" matchmaking but in reality handicap based matchmaking shite.."
It�s my fav gun it and grau purple tracer pack was my best purchase of my life

Thunderhooves + headset  vs any gun = my dog could do it.
"bruh, the sweat"
This looks 2 sus
LOL
Are we still on this? When a new CoD game comes out the previous one stops receiving huge updates and full development. Its been like this for every CoD. Nothing wrong with the battle pass not having mw content. Only thing wrong is having it in mw.
If there is no content why does it tell me to buy it every time I log in
"Cross-play was never intended to include PC players. PC players are pussies unable to play without honour. 

With that being said, Warzone became a place for pussies cheating against real console players trying to have some fun, to actual play.

I only play multiplayer with cross-play disabled. Even so from time to time, you still find cheaters on console. Not even close to the PC ones tho.

MW was an awesome game, now it's just a lot of nonsense, with pussies fucking the whole game experience with their bullshit."
[deleted]
Consoles have very crazy aim assist
Pc does have a advantage but just play and deal with it most pc players ain�t the gods you think they are there just like us console player some are great some are ok and most are shit
"r/lostredditors

OP isn't talking about pc vs console performance at all, and I genuinely have no idea why you think he is."
"Yea I just tried it as well and I'm definitely not buying it. You're correct in your statement, looks and feels like an old game. Music is pretty great tho"
"Finally, someone who knows something"
"I felt the same way during the beta. I gave it three days figuring that if I gave it a chance maybe I'd like it. My first impression was right. I didn't like the graphics, movement, guns and the audio was atrocious. I did like the maps, but the rest sucked imo. 

After three days I cancelled my pre-order. It's the first COD I've cancelled."
Exactly. Maps are solid. Everything else was lacking. Movement in CW feels clunky as shit. I hate it.
"CW is fairly comparable with mobile games, not MW."
Hahaha very true
"Uh, COD mobile is BETTER and MORE FUN than CW tbqh. The literal mobile cod has more and better content than CW does. And it's FREE."
"I saw 1 minute of that leaked gameplay from the streamer that ""accidentally"" showed it. That was all it took for me. Its a bo3/bo4 reskin.

 The new warzone map better not look like that piece of shit fireteam/outbreak/blackout map
And they should just give us the fking cx9 and raal and pistol already. The cw guns look, feel and sound sub par..."
"I put a good 70+ hrs into Cold War, it has some good features and potential but I cant disagree with anything said here."
Basically COD mobile
Lol fr
"I agree with you on this, the netcode will so trash on COD CW even packet loss is worse on it. MW packet loss doesn't go past 38% whilst CW's is hold my beer see you at 86% with connection interrupts. It's almost like CW friends to one up MW in the worse way possible"
"yeah the movement was the first jarring thing i noticed, MW does it a lot better."
One of the first weapons I leveled up. I got gold camo on it. Pistols were my favorite as part of the camo grinding.
It�s a lot more fun on hardcore mode. I always got hit markers so I went to HC and use the m19 obsidian with 32 rounds and fmj thing is a beast
Yo my man on xgames mode
"When I first used it I was dropping 20-30 kills each game, now I couldn't kill 10 people if you asked not sure why my aim is off"
Another guy also completed games of summer it seems

"Something tells that we could be able to use all those CW operators and weapons in Modern Warfare also, not only in Warzone... but they made it purposely that we can't. Why not, balance weapons more, give us operators, not a big deal :D Anyway Cold War is meh... Yup i have CW, and it feels like huge step back. Tho visual design of game and music i like just like in MW/WZ."
Nah i dont think they will put cw ops in Mw that would just be pointless. If anything thats just gonna turn heads toward mw which they dont want.
CW/WZ weapons should be in MW customs and certain modes
"It's not a possibility, it's a fact. Warzone is MW. That why when you download warzone only, you don't need to download anything else to play MW mp. Basically all cw stuff is usable in MW, but they block it. It makes sense they don't want people to use MW to level up CW stuff without buying it."
Did it show in the match as well? I�ve heard people report that when selecting random operators it will pick Cold War ones but they display as Wyatt in game. Apparently the voice is CW though.
"It kicked us out, which is shame because i wanted to see it myself. This Connection issue happens very often D:"

"happen to me too, since yesterday i got kicked several times ""internet connection"" the game said, when i look at task manager and noticed that Modern Warfare consume the most network bandwith  
but at 10 am yesterday i was able to play the game until night without getting any problem  


but this morning i try to played it again and the problem showing up again like yesterday"
I think those new CDL operators can only be used in warzone and Cold War.
"I�m afraid that is true, it says Cold War when you buy the league bundles now"
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep.
[deleted]
"Hey thanks for responding. But that's the thing, it's not on any of them... I've checked every sing operator and all their outfits... Nothing there. It shows I have a green indicator on the ""Coalition"" operators meaning I have unlocked something, but there is still nothing..."

I picked up  the cx9 from a box in warzone. A blueprint called serac. The gun is a beast. It completly melts and is very cool looking. Just give us fking guns already activision. No one gives a shit about the cw garbage
"I unlocked the CX-9 and Sykov and got them to max level about two weeks ago. I couldn't get the RAAL challenge to work, they must've patched them. It is nice to be able to try out the guns, but they're probably gonna reset any early progress when the guns come out... if they ever do."
"Been hearing that they�ve been dropping as floor loot blueprints lately, I hate that I couldn�t level up the sykov though."
They definitely broke the Xp for the new weapons i cant unlock the raal and cant level up the sykov
"I recently tried to complete the unlock challenge (= 2 long distance kills with a SMG in 5 different games) for the CX-9 in MW Multiplayer. Did it with a MP7; once based on the ""Trivor"" blueprint; the second time basic MP7 with attachments. Absolutely got the challenge done but it was not tracked (Counter in Survival Mode still is 0/5)-- at least not for unlocking the CX-9. The tracking for the camo-challenge counted correctly.  
I don't know how some players or streamers got the CX-9 unlocked --- maybe this was patched afterwards, so unlocking works not before the weapon is released officially.  


Does anybody run into the same issue? Has anybody unlocked the CX-9 **lately**?"
"Lately, no, I�ve had mine maxed for some time now"
"I have the same issue, i even did the unlock challanges but it won't work and currently i have only the sykov unlocked but it won't level. Did you find out what the issue was or do you know if it got fixed yet?"
"I know nothing other than it appears they�ve broken the xp for the guns and the quest for them as well. If you�d like to use two of the guns in warzone, look for floor loot �Rook� (RAAL MG) and �Serac� CX-9. If these guns don�t drop by March 11th I�ll be surprised."
"Cuz they don�t care

They got your money already"
"The season 2 update has made it impossible to play split screen, me and my wife managed 3 games in about 15 attempts, what makes it worse is that the first time it crashes it completely freezes my playstation forcing me to switch it off at the wall!"
"I was playing with two other couples, a party of six, throughout lockdown in the U.K. 

Tonight we tried, one couple blue screened every single match, then for me and the other we blue screened in alternative games, all night. Not fun. 3 games with just 4 of us in as man hours. 

Shameful dev work."
Well it is literally false advertisement since the feature hasn�t been working for a while and they haven�t said anything about fixing it. But probably our best bet to get it fixed is to get enough upvotes or report it to Activision�s website
unfortunately pc doesn't have splitscreen. but yeah I've noticed splitscreen players on zombies tend to d/c sometime in the match. wish i could help
"Yes, here on Xbox!"
"Yeah, I�ve been trying to raise this issue for some time now. It started with integration, and then got worse in the past month where now 8 out of ten games freeze when loading into the match before it then shoots my girlfriend and I to the Xbox home. Not a single support team or dev response to the numerous complaints on their support site or here. We paid money to play the game split screen as advertised and can no longer do that. They broke the game that we paid for with no intention of fixing it. I�ll be more than happy to charge a refund and see what other means are accessible"
Join @activisionfails on Twitter he is trying to get people with the same issue on board and working together
I started tweeting ATVAssist daily on Twitter to let them know it had crashed; again and again they just ignored me and many others!
I�ve been spreading this link all over Twitter where I can to raise the point! Hope we get it fixed!!
Yeah have also been dealing with this issue for ages. Anyone know if it's also on next gen consoles?
"It�s worse on PS5, on the PS4 we could get a game here or there before it crashes. On PS5 it doesn�t even load split screen before crashing."
"Yeah, 100 sure that Black Ops Cold War and Modern Warfare have the same issue on next gen. I've watched it happen."
"Are you serious? Lawsuit? You have zero proof there is no work being done to address the issue. 
You people I swear are the worse"
"Straight over your head it seems. 

Considering the game is being sold with couch, co-op, split screen as an advertised feature it actually makes it a crime to knowingly not publicly address or change that. At least here in the U.K, having failed to supply it. 

Remember when Bethesda had to ship a bag out to everyone twice, on Fallout 76 launch? Because the first wasn't made of the exact material as the advertised one?

So yeah, relax a little. Also, you need to use 'worst', not 'worse', in that context."
Buff eod
Maybe they�re direct impacting you? Idk I don�t use EOD
"That's another thing, I hit em dead on and they still survive too. Shits bugged or they're modding cuz that don't seem right."
"EOD exists exactly for that purpose, so the annoying RPG spammers don't get rewarded for that shitty playstyle. What's the issue supposed to be?"
"Lol. I have my single shot instant kill boomstick, I'm sure you have yours aswell. Life, uh, finds a way."
Yea the conspiracy is only you get killed with eod and rpg shots and yours dosent work. Get outta here
The game is just fucking broken at this point
Every update brother
I don�t think they can do that since a lot people paid for them in the passes.
"Yea that is true, plus people still use it for warzone."
"Yeah I sometimes have that button disappear too. I think if you play around going in and out of menus it may reappear. What a pain in the ass. How does every update bring broken shit into this game lol.  Like seriously, can�t they just add shit without touching old shit and assume it�ll work fine still?"
"Hey man, posted the same issue 2 days ago and got some help for that for you.

Got the same issue but you can still access them via pressing ""3"" on PC or if your on console ""R3"". Glad to see more people have that issue. Hope they fix this issue... but i kinda doubt that tbh.

Hope that helps you to access them again."
"Noice, thanx bro...when i get homw tomorrow I'll know what to do"
"I'm not sure about the tokens, but they removed the blueprint missions and Intel missions from MW so that sucks. I wouldn't be surprised if they removed other things too such as the tokens or something."
"Yea it does, because i know before the update they all were there. But my game just froze and i force close it only to see it had a 28gb update. After the update they were gone sadly"
They did? Why?
"The button shows up if you search for a game. Just doesnt if you are in the main lobby.  


Odd part is that it showed up fine earlier tonight then all of a sudden it was gone on the main lobby. Nothing updated as far as i know so i'm guessing the game just broke again."
"Ah gotcha, thnx for the heads up"
You can't even use them in MW so I expect it's another bug they've caused.
"You can use them in MW.  


Been using all of them in STS to rank guns up faster so i can get them all the the ""Disappointus"" camo."
I�m on Xbox and the game isn�t launching for me. Got in for a second and then crashed on the first game.
"Yeah same here, got in for a second finally and then it booted me. Probably maintenance or some shit but I still stand by my statement that this update is fucking with everything."
"The same exact thing was happening to me, I ended up having to uninstall the game and re-download the entire 200gigs. I tried all the fixes, and sadly in my case, I had to reinstall. Might not be the case for you, but chances are you have to."
"This is ridiculous if I gave to reinstall the game, It is a hell of 200Gigs. I tried to repair it but I am still stuck with this annoying issue."
"Out of 15 matches, 13 of them was Shoot House ... So yes, separate playlists please!"
Friendly fire will not be tolerated!
I committed a war crime for science
SAME SIDE SAME SIDE
Always have
My head got splatted by an mp5 in multiplayer recently. I never seen that before.
There�s a dismemberment bundle for the mp5
I thought Hadirs sniper rifle was the only gun in campaign that could dismember
Me too and it was but I guess they must have added dismemberment for shotguns at some point. Unless its a glitch because I haven't tried any other missions yet
Nice kills tho :D

In shoot the ship straight up ask ppl in the lobby to equip the kill streaks you need to destroy
"yep, its supposed to be torture. Have u done riot shield yet? lol"
Yeah three launchers is all I have left. I messed up leaving these until last. Riot shield was tough too
"Just play shoot the ship. Won�t be long before you find people that are firing up personals all the time. 

I only have the PILA to do... I made sure I did as many of the tougher weapons as I could first, so riot, knife and most launchers are done. 8 weapons to go until Damascus!"
"True, thank you lol. Only three launchers to go myself, can�t wait to be done with these lol. Damascus camo is so nice"
"Good luck mate, I unlocked platinum on them last night."
Try HC mode.  I found more people run with UAV/PUAV/CUAV due to lack of minimap.  Pretty much spent the entire grind playing HC.
Download the cold war free trial
"I couldn�t figure it out. Kept flipping through menus with no instruction of how to actually play. Just felt like an ad after a while since I only play MW/MP. 

I can�t even flip between the lobby and the loadout screen without being forced to see content I can�t do anything with. They could at least provide a some instruction instead of just dead ends or tell me to buy the other game."
Cold War > Zombies
I spent 15 minutes and I couldn�t find anything. Their social media accounts made me even more confused on it. �Can�t be pissed off if I�m confused� -dev logic
"Outbreak is a zombies mode and treyarch games are the ones known for zombies so it is obvious it is a cold war mode

But you can get some of the stuff in warzone but thats it"

"I never understood this, how do you cancel the slide?"
Just press slide 2 times really fast. Set it to tap to slide instead of hold. And if you don't have paddles try using tactical layout. You can also use bumper jumper tactical to be able to jump way easier too. Or use default layout and try playing with a claw grip
"To slide cancel press crouch twice followed by jump. The first crouch gets you sliding, the second crouch stops your slide, and then jump gets you back into a standing position"
I can�t not use paddles now
Same. Even tho I�ve literally used it for less than a day
Less sens= more auto aim
Not really sure what you mean by that
"Note this is just bot lobbies on recruit. I�m not nearly ready for real lobbies. Also in case anyone is interested, I am using the Power A Fusion Pro controller with 2 back paddles, 7-7 in game sens."
[removed]
"More so of a challenge for myself, but also I wanted to improve my overall movement and close range gun fighting skills and I thought controller would be good at that. Even though I�m pretty good at keyboard, I really look up to players like Aydan and JoeWo"
Set your deadzone to as low as you can handle. Try out the different aim response curves
"Ok I set it to 0 dead zone and didn�t notice any stuck drift when I let go. Just to be safe I put it on 0.01. Maybe stick drift happens as the controller gets used more? Also, between dynamic and linear AA which is better?"
"It's been a sort of feature for a while, only in ground war too. Sometimes I find they ping teammate positions while other times they ping enemy positions. Good against corner campers ngl."
Respawned you mean?
I get it too. Like yellow flashing spots where enemies are.
Never had it happen personally just reinstall seems to fix most of the problems with that wacky game
I usually just close the game. And reopen a few times
"Clear cache your console, remove and readd your Xbox profile.

I fixed it by doing this."
Gotta uninstall and re-install this happens to me all the time sadly.
Hard restart the xbox if that doesn't work check all your data packs last resort uninstall hope this helped:)
"Have you tried unplugging then replugging the external hard drive if your using one?
If that doesn't work then restart the console. 
That should fix your issue because it fixes it for me."
Check your disc content is installed
"Hold down Xbox button for 10 seconds and turn it back on, it starts working for me"
Why would anyone buy a disc these days especially for call of duty lol
It was a present.
Some people still like physical copies. I still get a physical copy of games I know I�ll enjoy or when I get a collectors edition of something. Comes with artwork and sometimes code you wouldn�t otherwise get... also with a physical copy there�s no chance of you losing your ownership of a game... I�ve had games straight up disappear from my digital library and not be able to get them back even with proof of purchase because companies are corrupt..

With all of these COD wavy camos, thought of how the all time best wavy artwork would look on the M13 just as a quick demo.

"Thank you for the quick reply! unfortunately for me this is something that's already been done, I really do appreciate you reaching out to try and help though! I hope you can enjoy the game for both of us at least lol."
"I'm having the same issue and have tried all the same ""solutions"" people have suggested. Following in hopes that someone suggests a fix."
"It's so frustrating to have to deal with, I still have yet to find a solution the error pops anytime I load up MW. COD CW works great no issues but, I'd like to play Warzone and for w/e reason it's unplayable for me. I don't understand how this issue hasn't received more attention, but I wish you the best of luck finding a solution. Ill be sure to update if I'm able to find one."
No
Lol nice answer bro. Why?
Seen it.
Seent
Seen it was well.
Seent
"Because not enough people complained, so the Devs were never forced to acknowledge it."

No
I have extra cod points don�t know what to do with them. What do I get?
What is the Vulcan bundle? You mean velikan? Also how many cod points you got?
No only Warzone and Cold War. Activision purposely killing off MW so we would move on to Black Ops.
Which is what any normal person does.
"That�s sad to see, I�m not interested at all in black ops, I love the modern setting and weaponry of MW"
"Nope, everything in the battle pass is CW and Warzone only. Nothing for MW multiplayer."

"""only"" 10-20k xp"
Thats not a lot for getting 40 to 60 kills on shipment plus obj score. Did you play shipment during modern warfare's cycle? Easily got 30k plus per game
"At this point in the game, does xp even matter anymore.  I felt from the start it didn't matter at all"
Damn how do you use that fat ass reticle
Can you use those in warzone?
"I think you can only use cold war stickers and charms on cold war weapons, so they are available in warzone but not on MW weapons"
This is the kind of shit that will make me never buy CW
"Cold War itself is a good game, but the Warzone and Cold War merge ruined the MW franchise"
"Me personally,

I don�t want anything from Cold War in MW. 

The aesthetic of CW is wayyy different than MW. 

character models all look terrible, I don�t own the game but every model I�ve seen in WZ from CW looks worse than the ugliest one in MW."
Ya and those fucks don�t show the MW ones in CW! Why not do it both ways Activision?? Huh!!
"cuz... sell, sell, sell"
They ruined MW with Cold War inclusion ngl
I think its just a bug because you can use cold war stickers now
Mine all showed up from Game pass one. Only on the new update tho. So we are on GP 2 and now they arrive.
Would actually love if you could use them on MW guns.
Annoying. I have the CDL pack from CW & I can�t put it on my MW guns because I don�t have multiplayer
"Oh look, it's the reason MW was my first COD since 2! Greedy bullshit."
where can i see the cold war charms and stickers?
"At the gunsmith.

Just go to the charms section."
Because you can use them in Warzone which is integrated into MW.
"Fuck warzone

All my homies hate warzone"
Warzone
"Heh fun story about the JAK-12 


Me and 2 buddies played a game of shipment 

With 32 round mags 


The match was over in 3 minutes"
That sounds fun
"They were removed to protect the general population of normal humans from people like you. MUTE THE DAMN CHAT.

In addition, unless your solution is for the company to keep millions of hours of voice chats recorded and filed to hard drives, they can't really prove someone said a bad word based on some report."
Imagine if they had to filter the game based on everyone blocking. Blocking doesn�t ensure you won�t end up in the same match. You can always leave the match?
"Leaving doesn't work most of the time, you just get put back in the same lobby sometimes many times in a row. It's just disappointing how poorly supported this game was for full price."
"So you want everyone to have the power to potentially get anyone who said something they don't like banned because they got their feelings hurt or were just feeling vindictive. They're words, they can't hurt you. Stop trying to control what other people do in video games when you have an option to deal with it, mute them.  You can't control what people say, but ACTV gave you a way to control what you hear. Grow a thicker skin and move on."
"I personally find all of the S2 BP content underwhelming, same goes for the leaked bundles and the Outbreak rewards/event.  And then there's the gameplay.  The polish and quality of content just does not compare to MW."
CW MP is utter garbage. Zombies is great tho
"Yeah, I enjoy zombies, but the movement makes it feel a lot easier than past zombies, but I still like it."
"They made this game from their homes man, you can�t expect better. But again, the zombies is far better than MW co-op."
"They still charging sixty bucks, for sixty bucks, I expect a great AAA game, and for sixty bucks, they better give it to me. That being said, if they still gonna charge sixty bucks and they had to work from home, they shoulda delayed it a year or two. Most people wouldn't be bothered. Hard-core CoD fans would like that anyway and the casuals don't care, they just play whatever's shiny and new. Working from home ain't an excuse unless they planning to release it for free."
"And yeah, Zombies is leagues above MW co-op. MW co-op is fun for about 6 minutes, but 3arch Zombies (to me anyway) has always been a fantastic mode. This may be controversial, but I think the BO4 zombies was the best, followed closely by bo3 (bo3 would've been first for me if the zombies legacy pack or whatever it was that had all the old school maps was called didn't cost so much)."
The spec ops in mw2019 fucking sucked and i was excited for it because the mw2 spec ops was so good
"Currently on sale, I saw it on the battle net page for $53 Canadian ($41 US) 

Imo, that�s a great price for what the game is."
Played outbreak last night and had a lot of fun. Bought the battle pass and will probably play some multiplayer later. So far so good for me. $20 for a battle pass is nothing
"yeah, I thought outbreak was a ton of fun, it was a little easy though. If they added more zombies to the map, it could be so much better."
"express, raid and nuketown were in a throwback 247 playlist and it was pretty good just like backnin the day"
Even these maps are awful in Cold War
"So it sucks in most ways but it�s fun for less than 40 minutes at a time? That�s about the most positive thing I�ve heard about Cold War. I�ll pass. Even as a COD fan it�s not worth the storage space on my SSD, even if it was free forever."
"I hear that. I was hesitant, and I won't be spending money on it when it loses it's free ""status"" but it's a fun experience to try out."
Well they removed the missions entirely for MW. So I wouldn't be surprised if they removed the intel missions too.
Including blueprint challenges?
You might check special ops as some of the locations are still open.  In the same boat myself.
"Alright, thank you"
"I inadvertently moved my Intel challenges up by one last week when I clicked on a laptop at the Air Force base. 

I think your bug is an caused by an oversight. Some portions of the map are inaccessible now like the areas under the stadium or some of the bunkers since they added the Vodianoy to Verdansk so if I had to guess, any content that take place there just got dropped entirely. Really shitty spot to be in. Have you opened a support ticket?"
I had just completed the scrapyard hangar intel and I was supposed to find the one in the bank next. I haven't gotten a support ticket yet because I didnt know if it was intended or a bug
Bonk
has a tf2 engineer main this is great you have Satisfied the tf2 gods
RIP tf2...
Bruh what it�s not dead
what's so special about it? it's just an usual execution
"Theres nothing special, I just wanted to do it."

Cant wait til they patch this in two years
"Ehh, that's a little too early probably

remindme! 4 years"
40gb patch incoming
it would be better if you posted this in the warzone subreddit. this subreddit is primarily for the regular MP
"Yeah, devs might not see it on on this sub"
"I�d this a bug or feature? 
Bethesda - �yes�"
So in theory could you start with a smaller amount and work your way up ?
This was shown by a person spect a cheater months and months ago on here.
Submit a bug report then.
I hope they just get rid of stopping power.
D:
"Ahh, the CoD cycle.  You can dread it, run from it, but it arrives just the same.  It's inevitable."
I haven�t got the vault packs either so chill
"Why chill? xD Judging by how long it takes for a problem to be noticed and fixed rn it's never going to happen xD And I'll see f2p Warzone plebs donning the skin I've wanted almost all lifecycle xD

EDIT: also, you not having it doesn't mean it's a timezone thing"
what do you want us to do about it?
"So wait, why is there a 'Bug' tag if it has no purpose? See it at least, Jesus"
"It doesn't take over 500GB, its because the ps4 has to hold 3 copies of the files its updating. It holds the game files, a copy of it, and the download. The updates are the reason it wont fit, not the game files. And yes they mean the full game."
ohh i see... thank you
I wish I could delete all of the f****** Warzone files that I don't give a s*** about.
it means that you can't have MW cold war and warzone all togheter but if you're a good boi you didn't bought cold war in the first place
i did but i might delete it cus fuck that. i can�t spend more than an hour without being frustrated and turning it off.
"I think it�s all he updates and fixer ones hell my Xbox has a 1tb external and I had a 700 Gb update 


It�s form that probally"
700 GB UPDATE WHAT???
"40 bucks ? i would be contacting them every single day until its addressed, and be talking to managers"
I'm not sure there is much you can do I'm sorry
Lol
Did you recover the cod points ?
"No, nothing yet. And I contacted them like 2 or 3 times since I posted this."
Imagine buying cod points
"You are on the MW subreddit judging people buying cod points? Okay...
For the record, I have never bought any.
I bought the BO4 expensive version that came with all of the DLCs, where the cod points were bonus. 
Since then, I never spent any on cosmetics, only on season passes which made me gain more cod points."
Imagine being the guy running down there and jsut seeing some dude fall from the building

Yea idk what it is. I've always had good internet and this just has been happening. I've had a new cord and everything.

It's not a bug, it's a feature."
What is this and what did you do
"Just jumped into my first multiplayer game after the update, cool but strange"
Also noticed some new lighting when viewing operators.
why are you removing my posts

Yep has been happening to me since the Cold War integration.
They should have never integrated it.  Been nothing but problems since.
"Exactly the same problem, nightmare. Even did a full reinstall and it fixed nothing."
Shit thanks for saying that. That was my next option just didn't want to do it.
"Yep, as others have mentioned, about 3 weeks. If I power off and clear cache, I can get between 1-3 rounds before it crashes. 

Absolute trash that it�s been an issue this long with no improvement"
Yeah it came in with the feb update
"Unfortunately split screen has always and likely always will be glitchy in this game, not much you can do about it as far as I know."
I've never had this problem till recently.  Sucks though. I hate the way black ops moves.
What region are you in and what platform
I'm in Europe and on Xbox
You didn�t lose anything. They were showing in your operator menu because of a bug. These packs were always supposed to be purchased unless you owned them since season 1.
I had the bale skins unlocked and had started the first Grinch challenge I was on 3 ads kills
You could unlock the CX-9 before but I think they fixed it
Sounds like an air rifle.
"Yeah I can�t run any gun without a silencer, not just cuz it hides position but I find the shot sound to be very distracting."
"You will, but only with the spr. One day you�ll use a real sniper"
Dragonuv so he can stay hardscoped for 10/15/20 kills. I will have to start working towards the goal of getting that clip
nice clip
loadout?
"i have obsidian for the spr
i use the ultimate stock,zlr asp,tac laser,lapua mags and the sniper scope
it has good stability and good ads speed"
Normally I dislike sniper videos but ...the ballsy rpg shot!! I would've tilted so hard if I was that guy.
I would be screaming the whole time in aw
[deleted]
"1) the sound of the gun reveals my position and I find it very distracting/annoying hence the silencer

2) the overall setup was actually intended to not maximize ADS speed, allows more leeway for micro adjustments while I�m scoping in during close quarters fights. If I used the best ADS setup it would be way too snappy for my liking on shipment. Also I only hitmarkered once, and that was the guy with the dual pistols running out of the crate. Other shots were either missed, or I didn�t actually take the shot and just scopes in."
Was expecting a second sniper but nope an rpg lmao
Ok the dude that went flying when you shot him with the sniper was hilarious
unfortunately no. maybe some third party sites may have that info but i dont think you can see your battle pass progression on previous seasons. I know you can see your ranking progression through seasons though
"Alright, thanks dude!"
That seems like an amazing idea.  It would be cool if you could go through and select the content you missed and add them to a cart.
It�s called �The Moist Kangaroo� normally they are holding a sniper then finish off sliding away from you like a child on a greased up mountain top
"I think it�s for the hit boxes so you end up shooting the legs instead of the chest or something 
It�s also meant to make it a bit harder to track"
I guess that makes sense.but isn't that the point of sliding to?at least to move a little quicker when sliding. When I try to do the jumps it doesnt feel like I'm jumping very high or fast at all
"Slide jumping and doing so at a corner by zooming before the jump then releasing and zooming again while in air and turning the corner will accelerate the camera and gets you a few frames ahead of your opponents on the other side, its an advantage your opponent will find the over come. That said a lot of people playing do it incorrectly after seeing someone do it successfully and continue to do it thinking they are getting one over... play CDL and you�ll see what i mean"
Oh okay that makes sense
Basically a few streamers said it was very effective and monkey see monkey do.  People think it give an advantage but for players like you and me it just draws our attention and they�re a target.
Use frangible disable against it.  It works Wonder ;)
for me its simple to you can go in one direction at full speed when you jump (in the air) and be looking towards the enemy in any other direction
Should've bought gamestop stocks instead of their games
Ahhh the fabled shoot the sky victory dance! This must be like the rain dance for cod players
LMAO I guess you're right
It�s cringy as hell
"Congrats, you did it smart and kept a good weapon for last. Im stuck with 2 launchers and the riot shield. I literally never used the riot shield, hate the damn thing and wish it wasn't included."
"yep, try to ask for help, I did mine in shipment in like 3 days, I asked for help and camped the mid crate in shipment"
For the riot shield just go into hardcore and ask people for help some will be nice but a lot won�t I was playing with my friend and this one kid asked for help and 4 out of 5 on my team were helping him he would�ve got a nuke if the other guy on my team didn�t throw a Semtex at him and kill him
I started with melee and launchers and ended with mp5 and m4. Don't know why anyone would leave the worst for last.
Me too..lol. I swear both my launchers are on 90% ... attacker and defender camo barely moving
Fam change your passwords and be sure to have 2FA enabled. My shit got hacked last night after I unlocked damascus. Just looking out and congrats on getting it done. Be careful!!
Thanks for the advice bro... and did you get your account back? Can't believe people really out here trying to steal shit
Congrats!! It�s a legit rush just watching all those icons pop on screen!
Yessirrr and I did it like 3am and I had school today lol
Oh I thought you were going to get a nuke. But still Damascus jeeezzz bro I don�t have the patience to have gold on 5 weapons
Oooof... it cost a few brain cells lol
"And here I am, 23 days of multiplayer and still not Damascus. Riot shield is fucking boring"
don�t worry bro it took me like 6 months
If you try hard it will take you 2 days. It took me over all less than 5 in game time to get it.
Lmao took me 600
Damnnnnn
Congratulations! And how does the combination of blk rounds with cyclone barrel feel?
"I am really not a fan of the m13, but the blk rounds really made it good. It was hard at first with no attachments because I did everything in hardcore and the stock m13 can barely compete against other weapons, especially the ""ass"" Val"
Congrats!   Waiting for my dance number to come up...
"LOL THIS LATE (joking, congrats bro)"
I started late lol. Thanks bro!
"Woo-hoo! That's a helluva a feeling, right? Good job OP."
Feels amazing! Thank you!
"Finished mine last week. Tried to get a trick shot as my last kill for the AX-50, hit 3, and none registered."
Damnnnnn that's a bummer... main thing is you got the main prize... and congrats!
"Beyond professional work out there, bud."
Congrats. Such a fun yet frustrating grind!
"Thank you! And yes lol... it got me frustrated when there wasn't shoot the ship, because like those are the only 2 maps where people don't hide as much"
GG M13 was my last too
Niceeeee!

"I would definitely recommend it. Yes you can find matches almost instantly in any mode accept Spec Ops. In my opinion the gun play and overall detail is way better, and yes I do think it will be alive in a year from now. Not sure if another part is coming this year but that would be awesome."
"Thanks. The game costs 70 euros, I also know that there was a deal a few weeks ago, but do you think 70 euros is appropriate for this game.?
 I'm just looking for a cod that won't get boring after a new month."
The only thing I can recommend for myself right now is pepto bismol
"I bought the game a couple of weeks before the lunch of cold war because I wanted to wait before I pulled the trigger on it and see what people had to say about it, I been playing since and I personally really like the game. I'm going for damascus at the moment and have no intention of stop playing until I get it."
I have never played a cod game for longer than 7 months but I've been playing this one since launch bought coldwar and played if for 2 days before coming back to MW still very easy to get into a match and with SHG in charge of cod 2021 odds are I'll sit that one out as well and stick with it until mw2
"I see My plan would be to buy MW and then wait for MW2 (or whatever it will called) I just don't enjoy Cold War, now I don't know what it will be like with MW.  would  you recommend this game, even it costs � 70.?"
It is good and you can find players quickly but I tend to only play when the shoothouse and shipment playlist is in because a majority of the maps are terrible.
You must have felt your blood pressure going up haha
Looks like shoot house

"Once upon a time it meant your graphics card was going to start a fire, but I think it's just a bug with certain settings being turned on."
I think it might have to do with the new drivers because it only happened after the new driver update.
You didnt knew ? They used Covid to cover the development of HDR 69.420
It only happens on PC
ps4 attempts ray tracing - f\*\*\*ing dies
And then cremated and that ashes were consumed by the game server (here) thus the tripping effects.
It�s just a weird ass bug that happens to people on occasion. It�s been in the game since the beta
And they have never fixed it? Come on Infinity Ward
A camo I want
Who gave *everything* a star power-up?

I wish i could play like this
You say that but it�s hard to see them because the reflections end up camouflaging them.
"Its a shitty game that the devs dont care to fix, hope this helps!"
Lmao yeah happens after every new game launch
I�m having the same problem as well. Let me know if you figure it out!
"Finally, note that just when a game ends, you get experience in the battle pass, just hit the Square button (ps4) and it will finally come out to buy it, I have already given up and it worked for me !!! XD"
why would you wanna buy it you dont get shit for MW.  or do you like warzone that much?
It gives you more COD points
You need to buy it from the store. You�re trying to claim tokens here which you can�t do without owning the pass.
"It is true, but the option to buy the pass does not appear to me, if it is not the one in which I give it, as you say it is to claim"
"Man, I'm having the same issue that I cannot claim the battle pass. Activision still haven't acknowledged it yet"
"Bad connection probably, I have bad internet at my school and literally so many shots just won�t register, I�ve had point blank 725 shots not even hit marker"
"Actually that�s probably what it is, I�m at university currently and the WiFi is not the best"
like i might use a more powerful weapon and shooting at a enemy that shooting  form midrange and i would get the first hit and i still die and most hit
I�m 5 away from getting obsidian in the mp7 but it�s so frustrating when I get like 4 hits on a head shot and I don�t kill them
"that is possibly

the best Easter Egg in all of Modern Warfare"
Idk the Cheshire Park rats one is fucking hilarious
[deleted]
too bad they added it to quite possibly the worst map
They ruined the best modern warfare in close to a decade and all we get is a Godzilla teddy bear
"I did this in a public match and everyone just looked at it like  

�Wtf.�"
Ahhh. That�s why the updates are 80gb
And now CW and wz can�t fit in 500GB ps4
no its actually because of all the stupid store bundles and camos. They are hi res textures and every single one has to be downloaded in case you buy one or someone else has it
"No it isn't, look at the quality of the bear. It is literally just an upscaled bear that is already in the game. You should channel your hatred towards 4K store bundles that are mandatory downloads"
What's the combo?
"It's hard to explain in text bit theres 4 parts sticking on the wall that you have to keep shooting untill they break off, 2 on each side of the train station. Then when you break them (they have a lot of health) you read the order of numbers that will appear underneath them from left to right and go to the middle where there should be a clock or something. Shoot the clock untill it breaks and theres a keypad, then just put your code in and turn around"
It's random.
Wtf is going on here?
Yes.
What is the combo uou shoot in the number pad?
"You have to do the steps yourself in order to find the code because its random. Break the four plates on the walls by shooting them and then under each there will be a number. Read the numbers in order from left to right, then break the clock in the middle and insert your code"
Forgot this map existed ngl

Infinity Ward has a plush fetish or something.
Is this not old news...? From like months ago?
I thought the same. Why does this old easter egg have almost ten thousand upvotes?
"What map is this?  I read below someone said Cheshire Park but this looks nothing like the map, it looks most like St. Petrograd."
"The maps is called Train Station, it's a gunfight map."
"Right, but how?"
I miss the time Activia cared enough to add easter eggs like this one.
"Activision doesen't make the game, Infinity Ward is the one who makes Modern Warfare."
What map is this on
Train station (Gunfight)
They�re trying so hard to make these games fun and interesting but the turbo virgin super sweat MLG wannabes keep ruining it.

You need to also download modern ware ware not just Cold War.
I only have modern ware
No idea then. Sorry
Oh man
Are there missing data packs
Idk
"Yeah I've heard about this glitch, the CW integration into Warzone is causing it, no idea on how to actually fix it, you should probably contact support."
Ok
What happened to the question
No offense at all if anyone is but I find that just regular PC keyboard and mouse players complain about anyone they play against unless they are other KBM players.
I just wanted crossplay with Playstation.  Now that console players play with PC players we get the damn cheaters now
"I play on PC and here is how I see it. MW is the perfect example of crossplay in an FPS done right. They increased the AA for controller players enough to compete with mouse and keyboard players but they did not go overboard. Some situations M+KB is better, some situations controller is better. Giving them also the option to use mouse and kb on their console is a great addition too. Never have I died in my thousands of hours in MW and blamed AA for it. spawns, lag, inconsistent TTK, character not vaulting/sliding yes. Aim assist no.

Cold war on the otherhand is the worst example of crossplay I have seen. AA is so strong in that game it will literally play the game for you in some instances. Bullets bend to your targets while on mouse bullets will just phase through the enemy. This is extremely apparent with the burst rifles where you can hit all bullets of a burst without recoil compensating across the map on a controller. If you do that on a mouse you will miss atleast 1 bullet 90% of the time which is the difference between a kill or not and when these guns are meta (idk if they are anymore because I don't play the games MP because of this) it made it literally impossible to kill AA players.

&#x200B;

XIM should be banned though."
I won�t activate my cross-play to avoid PC cheaters.
"Its awesome, i can play with anyone no matter the console, there is no more barrier i just wish more games had cross-play because i dont want to buy a playstation or something and have to buy a game a second time that i already own on PC just to play a second account with no progress. Plus matchmaking finds matches way quicker. Controller players dont have extremely fast and snappy aim but they can still compete easily with PC."
"If cross-play is enabled it should separate lobbies based on input, xim and Cronus is on Sony and Microsoft to solve, if you use a K&M on console it�s an advantage over controller period"
Well it really depends on your sensitivity and how well you can find/aim at people. I switch between KB+M and controller on console (don�t worry about why it takes too long to explain) and some people are just cracked because of their sensitivity. I do agree though about having priority lobbies.
"In general the aim assist levels the field plenty because it helps mitigate the wandering hitboxes somewhat.

Truth is the exceptional mouse players are as rare as the exceptional pad players. You don't become shroud by suddenly playing mouse.

If you don't belt me about the aim assist, play a pistol 1v1 mouse Vs aim assisted pad. You might laugh or cry at hormone sided it feels.

I say have input matching and sbmm in a ranked playlist. For standard matchmaking, put everyone together.

People talk cheaters but there's cheating on console too. Not all those pad players are really playing pad you know, and those devices are capable of a lot more than just tricking the system about input device."
Do kbm players on console benefit from aim-assist?
Not in my experience on MW  if your talking about how it slows down on enemy with controller
"In MW and Warzone, aim assist is disabled as soon as it detects that KB/M is your selected input. Doesn't matter whether you are on console or PC."
"I think AIM assist should be removed.. Someone with with a Mouse has to learn to AIM, Tracking Targets and build Muscle memory.. 
Someone with AIM assist get Most of this for free 

I know there are skilled people with Controller that can easy Beat PC Players without AIM assist Just because there are skilled."
"Aim assist is in the game for a reason. As much as I bitch about it, I don't think it should be removed at all. A mouse will always have more control and speed than two joysticks, therefore aim assist picks up that slack for the controller player.

Should it be toned down? That's a better argument."
"Bro, we do aim with our thumbs"
It's way easier to aim with a mouse than with joy sticks. Mouse is much more precise and easy to use because fine movements are easier to perform and replicate. I'm a lifetime console player. The only PC game I have played is Minecraft and some point and click games like runescape. I played MW on PC for a few matches (first shooter game I have ever played on PC) and it's an absolute joke how easy a mouse is compared to a controller with aim assist. Anyone who says otherwise is lying because they don't want to admit that mouse is easier.
"My UI is still all grey and depressing. I wanna know what was the reason behind their decision of making it grey in the first place, that blue colour was quite nice."
"My last post shows how to fix it. In short, start a local lobby, back out of it. That's it."
Looks more like they restored the old one from before the cw merger.
"I just want to say that I love the loadout names, I'm also not entirely sure whether the title ""rifle"" refers to the down-converted m4 or the braced renetti, I love it"
"brrrrrrr = finn lmg with rof increaser

Alahuakbar = Ak47 with rpg7

""Smg"" = Uzi with the longest barrel, .41ae, and that big suppressor that buffs range

i pee lead = fennec

Crutch = as val

Recoil master = m4 with the best recoil reduction attachments

rifle = u guessed correctly

dey hab helicopter:( = fennec with any rocket launcher

Snipins a good job = ax50"
I doubt it. Theirs still a whole gun that should have came out already
I dont get it. If they can put the gun in warzone then shouldn't they be able to put the gun in multiplayer?
"In the warzone store there were only 1 row for mw content before but now there are 4 rows, so more bundles are coming but other than that probably not"
Honestly I think it's a good sign.  Why else make this change unless the game will continue to receive some level of support?
"One. Just one. And no, it�s not a Battlepass."
I fucking missed the blue UI so much. The greyish-tan color from CW is so godawful to look at.
yes it will... credible leakers say season 7 comes after march 11 after the live event
So credible that they changed the date twice on that claim already. But maybe third times the charm.
Ya but they probably just want people to buy cold war
Well atleast the UI matches the game and is no longer poo brown. The old UI colour looked fucking disgusting.
what part of the UI is different
"I think that was for pre-order only, check the * sign."
What does the \* say?
"""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare / Call of Duty: Warzone on pre-order platform required to redeem Woods Operator and Blueprint. Sold/downloaded separately. Must be redeemed by Nov. 13, 2021.""

but in the game store i checked the contents its shows the old faithful and woods operator so yeah"
"I received Woods without a preorder. Bought the game half way through Season 1. Either try restarting a few times, or send in a ticket. That, or the fact the skin unlocked for me is just another bug lol"
update: i got the woods pack i contacted the support and show photos of receipt and the store page showing woods is included
Hey im planning to digitally buy cold war as a late gift for myself how did you redeem woods? was it automatically given to you? is it in the phone app or i can just use the call of duty website?
contacted support then they gave him to me lol just show screenshots of receipt with ur user shower and the storepage in game  that show's woods is included
This is a common issue. The game will randomly reset your render resolution lower than what the actual resolution is and it's been going on since season 2. You need to go full screen to change it to the proper render resolution then go back to borderless.
"Actually my render resolution is higher than my native resolution like you see in the screenshot
Render resolution = 4k
Native resolution = UW 1440p
The game puts me at 100% 4k res in windowed borderless but my native res is lower than that"
The new lmg also a ground loot weapon and holy shit that things hits like a sledgehammer to the face
Can attest. Got it last night in some floor loot and it PUNCHES. Plus the optic with built in rangefinder is amazing. I want that optic for every weapon
"And like a sledgehammer, IT'S EXTREMELY SLOW AND HEAVY"
More confirmation that I think we r getting more modern warfare stuff on the 10th or 11th
"Yep I think you're right. Its the one year for warzone, the outbreak event ends with a bang... anyone else see the nuke blast in the red backdrop of the outbreak event title screen? Doesn't make sense that they would release new content for mw at the same time as the new season for cold war and the zombie event. They are trying to draw people to play that game as much as possible cause its pretty much dead, why release new guns for mw that will surely draw people away? Hopefully we see the new guns in a few weeks."
"Yeah probably, since it's a blueprint I doubt they scraped it"
"I fully was expecting to not see these guns get released. After this update, I am convinced that we will be seeing them fairly soon.

If they have put in the work to make blueprints with it, especially with a tracer pack, they plan on these being items that can be monetized in the store. That isn't a confirmation, but it's highly likely we'll be seeing these in the near future.

Also, the devs have control over what are dropped in the crates. It's not an accident that it was put in the game."
I really hope this is real
But he said it hasn't been realest.
"https://youtu.be/RRqvodPSu7Q

This guy was using it and it slaps"
"Yeah, people post screenshots which features new LMG, CX-9 and Sukov (all new guns) as floor loot in WZ and Weapon's cash field upgrade in normal MP (I wonder if you can unlock new LMG and use in Coop like CX-9 and Sukov)"
It's real I even have a screenshot of me holding it but it doesn't look that good because of a plunger notification
Released
"Nope, it�s a Scorpion Evo, in game it�ll be called the CX-9,"
"Found it yesterday aswell, really good gun imo"
Why do I get some ACR vibes? I know it isn't at all this gun but it kinda looks like it
I really want the ACR but no leaks just yet
ACR Stock
i found that too and tried it i think it's bugged jak12 its shoots exactly like jak12 shotgun looks like that too
Released
"That thing shreds. I cant wait to build one. Its the cx9.
You can build it in survival"
My fav gun in the game
I�ve also found the Ral MG. Feels like a modern day M60 + it has a cool optic.
Fuck I hope English is your second language.
"It is actually, sorry about that, i teach myself so it's not really good"
"Thats the CX-9, the new SMG. Its supposed to be coming with the Soap Operator Bundle. It has Ice Tracers and Dismemberment."
Acr?
Scorpion evo
If this comes on warzone then it's game over lol. Greatest weapon ever

To add to this as a long time console gamer I started with this game at 800dpi and ads sensitivity around 9.2 with ads multiplier to .90. I now use 700 dpi 8.75 sens and .70 ads multiplier. It really comes down to using the same sensitivity over and over and what works best for you. Your mouse and mouse pad make all the difference with how the movement feels to you as well. With my setting I mostly wrist aim and maybe mover my arm a tiny bit for flicks. You just gotta play and find out for yourself.
I'm a wrist aimer and I have 3200 dpi with a 1.5 sensitivity. 1500 with a 15 is way too fast
"I have my ADS sens set to 1 and the high zoom set to 1.10 for whenever I wanna snipe. I made a post few minutes ago regarding people's sensitivity, I'm just waiting for few comments. 

Practically, slower sens builds better muscle memory since our body is able to adapt at bigger movements easily whereas with higher sens, it will take much more time to adapt since little micro-adjustments aren't easy to implement in the muscle memory scheme."
[deleted]
"Exo plays on low sens, he even lowered it a little bit after he collab'd with NexesPC.  


>Battlenonsense made a recent video

Thanks for this. I'm gonna check it out!"
"For MW respawn you'd want higher sens, for search and WZ you'd want lower sens.  You have to check multiple angles at a time for respawn but for search and WZ there's only a few angles to check and you can do really well at long ranges with lower sens, more accuracy.  So it depends on which mode you prefer.  One requires wrist for high sens, other require arm with low sens.

But, it all depends on you and what youre comfortable with.  To me it's much more benefitial to be both arm and wrist aim.  I suggest you learn about mouse acceleration and implement it in your set up, so you can get both low mouse sens while using reg guns that uses arm, and then fast wrist flicks that accel to high sens for quick 90-180s for fast reaction kills and corner checks.  

an example of someone in mw using mouse accel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIZmlAKUjuY

review of mouse accel by someone who switched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBXv0xi-wyQ

I like to have same sens hip fire and ads, higher sens for high zoom optics since higher zoom means more distance needed for same reticle movement."
"Hey dude, welcome to the PC Master Race (/s)

I switched from playing xbox exclusively since OG Halo LAN parties to PC (kbm) about 10 months ago. It's a tough transition. I spent the first 3-4 months as a bottom fragger among my friends.

I'm still figuring out dpi and sens and mess with it constantly. For MW, it's more about landing your first shot. There is an option for fov that matches the movement to screen pixels. My fov gets smaller when I ads (gives you essentially a zoom, wider fov for situational awareness when moving, smaller for zoom when aiming).  My Razer mouse has 5 profiles. I set different dpis for different games. 

For Warzone the ttk is much higher and the ranges are longer. You'll want to lower your dpi for sustained aiming. I only say lower dpi because it's a single push of a button.

I'll discuss aim assist a little here and in no way mean this to be demeaning to consoles. AA does a lot of the work. It doesn't aim for you, but slows and holds on target. A lot of console quick scopers don't realize that they have never actually hit a target. The sens is high, ads sense low. Just flick near then and start adsing. You just have to cross the person and AA slows you down as you cross them. For me, switching, I found I was constantly swinging past the target on kbm, since AA slows you down. 

Overall, I'll say this about dpi and sens. If people are divided and there are a wide range of opinions, it's probably because either the differences are small or what you get used to it's best. I use 1k-1.5k dpi, now and my current setup feels the smoothest to me. I started at max (16k) and have been trying different combos working down."
"fully agree with u on the AA. As I played on console the last 10+ years i didnt really ""noticed"" AA.

No I hate it while playing games with crossplay... u can almost see how one is snapping on you but it STOPS and the enemie can adjust his aim. i dont like it at all now XD

my main problem is, that i need a good fast movement without ""rowing"" all over my desk. but wrist only is often combined with inacurate ADS for me... so just keep trying

thx"
"Let me just say this: You should use whatever you're more comfortable with. When aiming, consistency is key, doesn't matter whether you aim with your wrist or arm. Being comfortable will let you be more consistent.

I personally am in a weird spot as I don't entirely aim with my wrist or arm, I'm sort of a hybrid but I use a smaller pad with a wrist rest and a heavier mouse. With that in mind, I use 1000 DPI with 10.43 sensitivity and 1x ADS multiplier.

My advice to you is, instead of orientating based on some numbers, find what kind of arm and wrist movement you're most comfortable with (physically comfortable), then find which numbers work best with that kind of movement."
"Just stop. You put the sensitivity to what you find comfortable not what other peoples are.

A good start is go in a private match, close your eyes and move your mouse to what you think a 180 or a 360 should be. If you over/undershoot, adjust accordingly.

As a general rule, when you play any kind of shooter turn off VSYNC, turn off mouse acceleration and turn off mouse smoothing (these two are the same in some games, different in others). These alone will make you improve massively. 

 I'd also recommend just turning on uniform aim sensitivity so your ADS speed and hipfire are the same (this is so you are only learning 1 sensitivity and not 2). Also try to keep your sensitivities between games the same. 

Lastly, I read in a comment in this thread someone swapped to PC in the last 10 months and is constantly changing their sensitivity. Never, ever, ever do this. You are only making it harder for yourself, we are creatures of habit. You just need to condition yourself to subconsciously know how far you have to move your mouse and constantly changing your sensitivity is doing the opposite. 

&#x200B;

For me I play on higher sensitivities and use my wrist more than my arm due to limitations in my mouse space when I first started out. I would recommend going for mainly arm and wrist for micro adjustments though. 

Since you are new too I'd rebind all your keyboard keys so the you are using TFGH instead of WASD for movement. This will give you alot more surrounding keys to bind to things in games, most of us use WASD but this is because this is how we started playing and changing it would throw things off. Since you are starting out now would be a great time to change to this."
"yeah you probaly right... I tried ""arm aiming the whole day today and it started to hurt in my shoulder... 

Also i just like to turn and flick with just my wrist. As of now i play with 1500 DPI and i'm going to adjust my ADS sense to that - hopefully i can manage micromanagement with that high DPI. THANKS :D"
"Just lower it and play. You've got the mechanics down, your body will naturally adapt to a new sensitivity. I personally use 1000dpi and 4 sens but I'd turn it down if I ever felt like I needed a change"
I appreciate your input. Are you a wrist/arm aimer or both?
I used to play with 1600DPI but switched to 800DPI and I saw a lot of difference regarding accuracy and control. I do play with 7.00 - 7.50 sens.
Are you more consistent with lower sens? Sometimes I tend to lose gunfights because I get 2 bullets in and I miss the 3rd one by few pixels.
"800 dpi, 6 in game"
"Wrist aiming, my chair ain't high enough for arm aiming

1600 dpi 5 in game"
I was considering something very similar to this when fiddling around with the settings. Thanks for the input.
"800 DPI, 2.63 sens."
"1440p, 800dpi, 5 sense in game"
"On 1800DPI at a 6.5 in game sensitivity. My sensitivity translates to a 12cm/360. 

For MW my sens feels perfect, although for other games I will lower it quite a bit."
It does the same thing on ps4
"We�ve been having similar problems, me and my housemates - playing on a PS5, we can start the game and join a lobby but as soon as it loads in, it instantly crashes and before the Season 2 update, it would do this but we�d be able to play a couple games but now, Jesus now?

MW is so fucked that I�ve had two instances of the game crashing and then making my Playstation crash too - the screen will pop up with a �error report submission� form (must�ve submitted 100+ of those in the last month!) and then it freezes, wait 5 minutes and the screen goes black and the PS is completely unresponsive. Only solution after something like this is to pull the plug which I hate doing because I get worried I�ll fuck up the console. 

I�ve never had it this bad and I�m 100% sure this new update has created this new hybrid monster bitch problem - sucks that Activision just doesn�t give a fuck about their fans, never mind split screen playing ones!"
It's comforting to know I'm not alone! Thanks for taking the time to reply.
Also habing this problem me and my girl can play 1 round maybe 2 then for no reason when its loading the next map the game crashes... is anyone working on this yet?
I have no idea how to report or track bugs in MW to be honest!
"On XSX multiplayer split screen crashes almost every time we try to join a match. 

SOME nights we can clear the Blu-ray info, delete our saves, and delete the 1gb reserved space and then restart Xbox to play again. Tonight it�s crashed now for an entire hour repeatedly. It just goes to a green or purple screen and then to Xbox Home Screen."
Interesting it's not HW dependent then- we are on Xbox One X
I'm just here to say you're not the only one. There literally needs to be someone else with you to play split-screen.

It�s discounted for me rn in the uk
For me only cold war has a discount and also im from germany and uk is no longer in eu so its probably always different
MW is back to �49.99 but it was on sale like 2 weeks ago (�35).

Is this a shop skin or is it platinum? Looks really good
"""Regal Retribution"" blueprint for the kilo."
">What�s with the S1 battle pass skins being released? This is a fucking joke

Huh? Highly requested bundles is a bad thing now?"
"They got rid of missions as well ,so I can't get ruby rampage now"
"If Cold War is its own separate product, why did they do everything they could to force it into MW and Warzone? Nothing about the Warzone integration was good. All the CW weapons were developed on a different game engine and then ported into this game. The weapons were designed around a 150 base health instead of a 100 base health that MW guns were designed around, which is why a lot of the CW guns have been absolutely broken since release. MW is a game that was built from the ground up on a new game engine and they just decide to stop releasing content after only one year just to promote a �same game every year� call of duty for a nice cash grab."
"Yeah exactly, if they really think �it�s a different product� then get the main menus out of modern warfare that force you to slide over to the left and select MW.  Treyarch is just bitter because no one wants their half assed COD game. And who care that you can level up cold wars battle pass?! You can only use those items in Warzone and CW, if it�s compatible with that then just add those items to MW too"
"I see green squares everywhere telling me theres something new. But theres not. I can pay for a battlepass with unlockable content. But theres not. I download huge update files for new content. But theres not new content, the green squares are still there and I update the game to get more shit thrown in my face telling me to buy a different game. Blame who you want, modern warfare started good and its now a shit show.

Edit: The vibes I get from MW now is like a bad early access game from new devs. Just remove everything from warzone and cw and make it a standalone game and it will thrive for years like mw2 did. Not gonna happen tho."
"Maby you should open up your eyes!! Most people on this reddit do not play the beta that is called cold war.. 

But since cold war, our beloved MW interface was altered to some colorless un insprirational shit. 

Everywere we look it is an advertisment for cold war. Weapons of cold war in warzone ect ect.

Updates of serveral gig we have to download, but arent for us.

I can go on and on...

We didnt asked for that crap, we dont want that crap. 

So move your smartass to the reddit of cold war and leave us alone!"
"They got rid of missions as well ,so I can't get ruby rampage now"
I�ve been able to proceed through missions since Season 2 started (currently doing the �get so many kills in a minute so may times� and it�s tracking). Did they remove some?
"Okay here's a big reason why we hate CW, okay. I loaded up modern Warfare today and guess what was the loading screen. WARZONE/COLDWAR, with MW, pushed to the side. It's like Warzone started in MW, Cold War took it, changed it, made all of their guns meta, and rubbing it the rest of our faces. The season 2, all black ops exclusives mostly. There's been nothing for us MW lot on warzone side. And then yet again, due to updates to warzone cold war side, we MW lot have to delete parts of MW. Every time I got into MW loadout screen, green squares for CW shit in WZ, which I have to go into Warzone to get rid of. It's like us MW lot have been left behind forgotten. I don't like CW in Warzone, it messed it up, the playstyle is all different now, the new gulag is crap. Most CW guns are OP as shit, and it's all due to CW. The game itself MEH, the feel of it felt like I was on ICE all the time, just didn't feel right for me and the look of it for me personally is weird. But I have an issue how CW just kidnapped MW and shat on it. Fully. I have to go through cinematic for CW when loading into MW, I have to get cinematic and reminders for Zombies. Some game modes I can't even play. To say no one is forcing you to play Cold War, bruh look at their advertisement. It's all over MW. They're trying to force us too, it's the trying too which pisses us off. Yes they're seperate games, but CW doesn't advertise it like that, they practically say, Here's Warzone it's just an extension of Cold War, Cold war? Did I say that? Oh have you heard of it? Yeah here's COLD WAR. COLD WAR? COLD WAR!!!! Cold War is Warzone. Modern Warfare never heard of it, but I have heard of Cold War.. Have you? DO YOU SEE HOW ANNOYING IT IS!!"
NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO PLAY COLD WAR - Yeah but they are sure forcing Cold War everywhere on MW. Even when you turn the game on it doesn't say Modern Warfare anymore.

Edit: And now I have just opened battlenet and this appeared instead my last played  game (MW):  
[https://imgur.com/3qOKsWU](https://imgur.com/3qOKsWU)

So no, they are not ""forcing"" us to buy/play this new fucking game."
Did both R-90 and Origin in a day on shipment 24/7. I had the others gold way before I wanted platinum.
damn one day??? bet...did you play Core or HC
"Wont take long at all, you�ve done the hard work with the launchers, I personally played hardcore and used specialist streaks"
yup. nothing was more painful than trying to hit Personal Radars with an RPG. Traumatic experiences.
"Shotguns are one of the easier categories to plat. The point blank kills are kinda annoying, but the rest is super easy. 

With STS, takes maybe 8-10 hours to do them all. Without it, add on a couple more hours."
"It doesn't take much time, hardcore shipment run and gun and you'll be able to get plat in no time."
"Shotguns are probably the easiest, especially with shoot/ship. Pistols are a close second for easyness. 

Took me a day per gun once I decided to bear down and do it. 

Start with the 1911 and origin, they're the worst of each class imo."
interesting.. thanks
In shipment it takes like 8 hours
8 hours for ALL?
Get on HC shoot the ship. You�ll crush it in no time.
How long did it take for launchers? I�m just barely starting and it feels like hell :(
"if you wanna save time and effort, level it up first on plunder contracts or by killing people. that way you should have all the challenges unlocked and u can get 6 of them done at the same time if u hit Personal Radars. it takes 2-3 days for each"
I already had the Origin gold and did the other three this week over the weekend and a couple of evenings. I found the R9-0 the most tedious. The rest were pretty fun especially the 725.

You should try the JOKR. It gives you just enough time to think about running away from your own rocket before it kills you
I think your own deployables in this map have Spawn Beacon code written into them. Every single time. Lol
I usually get that when I use a cluster or air strike on shipment.
"That happens EVERY SINGLE TIME. I�ve learned to call it where I�m standing so that when I inevitably die after calling it in, The enemy pushes to that location and it will get them while I spawn at a different section of the map hand on my dick and all."
Yes or shoot house
I�ve had this happen on much larger maps than shipment get at my shitty spawns bro
shipment be like
It do be like that tho
"cool spawn, bro"
Unlucky 100
"Shipment I called in a Cluster Strike, got killed then spawned/died 3 times in the same spot as the strike!  It be like that..."
"Look at the bright side, you got triple kills"
"Hey, you got 2 kills with it tho"
"Spawn flip usually tends to happen right after I pop a cluster strike, even worse on HC cause then it keeps hitting my team and killing me as a result"
Then don�t spam the respawn button after you throw a grenade
"This is why I mainly play SD, spawn logic has sucked since the first game was released way back in 2003. Remember when they released the CoD4 beta and the #1 complaint was spawning in air strikes? I do, and they didn't fix it. With mod tools we were able to fix the shitty logic, but we don't get those anymore."
Sigh.. I know this struggle
Karma is some time a big fat bitch.
"If you bought this battle pass, the reason you can't use the skins is because the operators are from the cold war and you can't use it in modern warfare. You cant refund the cod points."
So I can't use any skin from the battle pass in multiplayer ??
F
F
Is there anything at all in the battlepass except CP for MW players?
Yes the stickers work for MW guns now
I�ve heard March 11th so keep an eye out
I�m waiting too. I�ve been waiting since cold snore dropped. I have no idea why we can�t just get content on both games. It�s like we�re being forced to switch over to Cold War with this empty content in MW.
No
theyll come somewhere around 5076

Are you sure it is just the game that has packet loss? Have you run WinMTR pinging 8.8.8.8?. If not do that.
Thanks for the suggestion. Could you talk me through doing that?
Im getting it after downloading the update very weird
"What type of Internet connection do you have? In a country with curfews and home office recommendations, people with cable Internet have had a fair share of issues due to increased usage - due to the shared bandwidth that cable Internet provides, this led to people having to deal with far lower speeds, increased package loss and higher latency.

Do you share your Internet connection with other people (flat mates, family, etc.)? Maybe prioritising your PC in the router�s QoS settings may help as well.

It�s best to test other games online as well, in order to find out where the problem comes from. The game�s server, especially for Warzone, don�t seem to be able to cope well under the increased usage."
Wireless
"I used it yesterday, its freakin nice"
"Yeah, I picked one up for a few seconds before I died and was really confused."
Slaps.
Yeap. Wonder then we will actually have it along side with Sukov and CX-9
"The frames on this game are completely fucked. 

I used to get 200+ frames on 1440 with my 3080. Now I�m lucky to get 140. There�s also some sort of bug where I get lobbies that put me at 40-70 frames. No idea what that�s about. 

I�ve tried everything and nothing seems to fix it. No idea."
"Same man, every update the game just gets worse and worse performance I feel"
Conspiracy theory: Imagine they're doing this on purpose to make players move on from this game and push them in CW
"Yeah I�ve lost around 30-40Fps and I�m having constant rubber banding, makes no sense since my packet loss is listed as 0 and latency is fine."
Is this on max settings? I also have a 3070 and always had 120-130 FPS at max settings @120 fov. Maybe you had lower settings and they reset with the update?
Oh man I only thought it was my computer. Hopefully they release a patch for performance soon.
"Used to get 180-200FPS on my 3060Ti, then out of nowhere I got the fullscreen borderless issue and my Warzone FPS cant get above 140FPS on any settings. I've given up on a solution."
"I picked up the new LMG too in Warzone, forget the name(of the blueprint) but the optic actually has a range finder on it"
Oh yeah I did too! It literally has no recoil too lol
It�s the RAAL MG is the name
"�Bro, no full auto in buildings!�"

Ahh yes the conga line repeater
AK class?
"Monolithic, 40 round mag, stippled grip, laser sight, skeleton stock."
"dude got a 6on in ground war, respect"
Looks like it has a snatch grip similar to the PKM
"Yep, and I believe all three of its grip options are angled like this."
"The difference between weapons devoloped for MW and CW(integrated in Warzone) is  crazy.
The feel/sound and look is so much better on MW guns."
"Used it in Warzone last night. The thing is nasty.

Feels very similar to a snatch-grip PKM, but the recoil feels even less bouncy.

I am looking forward to the RAAL being a normal unlock."
"Wait, that optic is new, looks like a Leupold Holo Sight with a magnifier. Knowing IW, it's probably gonna be exclusive to the RAAL, but it'd be really cool to see that available on other guns.

EDIT: Wait a minute, I'm an idiot. That looks more like a Vortex UH-1 than a Leupold Holo."
"it has a rangefinder which is an amazing idea and makes the gun so unique, love it"
"It is, it's a unique optic based on an optic set seen in many pictures of the real gun; in-game, it has a built-in rangefinder.

It also has an aesthetically unique suppressor (Mono reskin)."
It's a [rangefinder](https://youtu.be/MbOyv91YeQw?t=349) scope
"looks like it has a hybrid optic, long barrel, 100rnd belt, snatch grip and monolithic suppressor."
"not hybrid, it's a 4x with a range indicator"
So beautiful
That boy a slapper! And the optic is insane too I want it for every gun
"this gun is really big, it will probably be the slowest in the entire game"
"Picked it up yesterday.  You move as fast as a sloth, like super super slow.  But man it feels like you're smacking the enemy with an anvil with every bullet."
Can this even be unlocked in CoD WarZone BattleRoyale ? I seem to get 7 kills in just one match but it didnt unlock ...
"It is, but for whatever reasons it purchasable and will demand CPs (even if it wouldn't charge you)"
I don't think you can access the download through modern warfare or warzone even though you can buy it. On pc I had to go through the blizzard launcher.
Its only on cold war
"Free'mium (Latin)---> ""Not really""."
Sound is delayed?
Idk. Captured it from my Xbox so I�m guess that�s what�s wrong...

Reminded me of mw2 on xbox360. Wish this was an option.
I'd actually pay for this to be a feature in future games.
"I didn�t click on the picture 30 times, thinking the �something went wrong� was from Reddit not playing the video, you did."
This is the way
Yea looks neat
I just assumed they removed them in the last update
They are still there in the barracks records though. Hopefully it's just a bug and gets fixed soon.
F.  I don't know what happened.  It's now gone.  Somehow.  Before I could even buy it.  WTF!
"""Fixed"" it by opening the Warcom Pack, which then made way for the Spetsnaz Pack.  I feel used lol."
"Don�t have it or the vault
Packs witch everyone said finally came out"
"I don't have the vault packs either...but I also completed all BPs.  So hard to say.  Regarding Septsnaz, I had to buy a pack to get it to reappear.  Went with Warcom and wasn't disappointed, even if I felt a bit used at the time lol"
btw are you Gibbles on YouTube?
Unfortunately it�s not in my store this morning.
"Sorry, mate :/  For some reason the bundle disappeared for me, but once I tried buying the Warcom one, Spetsnaz came back.  Crummy fix but it worked."
"A bit late to the party...sorry, just wondering if this is still up ? Dont want to be too disappointed when I come from work, hoping it's in the shore heheh...."
these faction packs [always available](https://i.imgur.com/v908VYy.png) in the operators section next to the selected operator for WZ only. i think they show up cuz all the operators are locked in f2p WZ except Domino.
"Good info, thanks!!"
"Lol it used to opposite, now I�ll definitely be playing it as I only play for shipment. Maybe they�re evening it out?"
"lol probably, damn."
i wish i had this problem. every time i search it's shoothouse for me. prob 1/10 times i'll get a shipment and it's mid game and i get put on the losing team.
Yeah I'm definitely getting more shipment all of a sudden which sucks because I also prefer shoot house more since it's not so brain dead like shipment
I came here to say this. I�m ONLY getting shipment and shoot house. It�s getting really annoying since I don�t prefer to play those maps often. And I�m only getting death match anymore. :( I just wanna play some strategy not hold the trigger and hope I hit someone.
"Can we swap? I�m getting shoothouse 9/10. Which I don�t mind occasionally, but going for obsidian, I prefer the chaos of shipment. Ideally there should be separate shipment and shoothouse playlists."
I wish
There�s a playlist called shoot the ship right now that has shoot house and shipment in it. You should have no problem at all getting 5 kills in a minute in that playlist. I think it�s impossible to not get 5 kills in a minute on shipment.
Exactly this. Shipment is the place you go to get lots of bodies in front of you. It's brutal and the spawns make no sense. It's a complete shitshow. But basically when you spawn you just press that triger and then start aiming. It is very likely someone will spawn in front of you at least 5 times a game. It's anoying cause you will also be on the other side of the barrel but for xp and challenges its the best. Need some hipfire kills or while crouching? Youll get that in seconds.
Shoot The Ship is currently available as a multiplayer mode. I definitely recommend it for any weapon grinding you ever need to do when it's available.
"> shipment map is the best but I can�t find that anywhere.

everyone struggles with this"
Yeah I can�t find it
On this thread. Where is this mode located ? Thank you
"On the main menu click on Shoot the Ship, though its not just for shipment its also for another map called shoot house"
The bear says �Grauuuu�
"Fr, I have mil sim as both operators and yet sometimes they sound like a female"
"Almost every time I get a kil, like 90% of the time, I get the same voice come out of the enemy, regardless of who their operator is."
"Oh yeah technically the veteran skin and some of the other mil sim skins are textured over domino. Because when I tried to do some mil sim challenges awhile back they weren't counting for certain skins. Furthermore, for a time, the shadow for some of those was domino. I even think you can see it on the korean one."
"ever since season 1 dropped i've been hearing stitch complain about friendly fire every now and then when i was on the allegiance team

i'd really like to know how some of this activision spaghetti works"
Well yeah if the whole team leaves you don�t want to just sit there for the next 5 minutes to get a match victory.
It feels like it�s a 1 in ~1000 chance to get one as the final AND not get it overtaken by someone who�s mounted in the middle
M O U N T E D   I N   T H E   M I D D L E
">mounted in the middle

hey I love that show"
I wana mount you in the middle ;*
How did he not hear your rhino feet chomping behind him?
That is a great question. And that is hilarious.
I like it! These 2 salty comments need Hungarian deli meat slung at them.
"Oddly specific. Also, username checks out."
I like it as well with the salt! And they do!
Nice
Nice.
Very nice
Thank you.
"Wasn't there a challenge for that, in ranks or something? Good job"
Then I do it and it�s play of the game
Wait I thought this was only available with the demon dog guy?? Wowwww I hope this execution is still available fir purchase
This execution is a generic one for everyone I believe.
How do you do the assassination?
Hold the melee button when you're behind someone.

"LOVE that execution, LOVE it
Especially fun when you are wearing that stars and stripes skin for extra MERICA!!!"
"Hell Yeah, Its become one of my favorite executions in the game."
I mean you did an assassination ? And ?
He done shot the lady with his finger guns.

Yeah it doesn't make any sense what people upvote on this sub.

"It says final kill, not best play. Unless I�m missing something"
yes
Oh nice that's great to hear!
Yep and exfil on outbreak seems a lot easier (use the death machine it�s a magical thing ) but yea you can unlock park from outbreak
Did anyone get to unlock her in the free week?
"I'll be able to tell you after I play with my friend tonight, he's the one using the free week."
Cool. You got lucky after trying to hardscope. Congrats
"Thanks, recently I�ve been feeling kinda sad cause of some COVID related events. Thank you for cheering me up"
Welcome to the club :-)
Can you say you�ve truly unlocked Damascus if you don�t frantically shoot in the air and spin around
Congratulations!  It�s a great feeling to finally get there.
My account got banned for no reason and I lost my damascus lmao but congratulations!
I feel ya bro
Nice to see someone else using the bizon. That thing is extremely underrated.
I only need the JOKR and Pila. I finished all the kills on the JOKR already so I�m cruising.

Make sure your activision account is linked to your battle net account. I thought something was wrong with my ox when I first built it but connecting the accounts solved the issue. Might not be the solution but I�d give it a try. I looked this up and you most likely won�t be able play it with your graphics.

I agree with you 100%. Shouldn�t have to wait 30 mins to get a game to work that you already own.

edit: I mean what map _was_ it"
I think it was arklov peak
Purgatory
Yeah the uh- new sky looks great!
Do you get to the cloud district very often?
that 160 fps sky do be lookin good tho
Still cant see Roze lol
Yeah...had this issue last night.  Figured I would just give it a few hours.
Agreed. Modern warfare lost Call of Duty�s attention really fast. Now it�s just ads for Cold War
Well yes they want people to get the new game problem is it dosent feel finished and they are trying to kill off MW so with this if it felt like I finished game I would probably be more ok with it
"It didn�t lose it fast, it lost it in the exact same time frame as every other call of duty, 1 year.

If anything it�s had more attention than any other game because they still need to keep it running due to warzone."
Lol 2 years? They need to have a game that stays around for 5 or more years. It takes them a year just to balance a game and then it gets abandoned.
�Activision has reviewed your suggestion and decided it doesn�t give a rat�s ass.�
"I think everyone agrees and wants this but until streamers, influencers, content creators and the general ignorant masses quit buying the games, they will continue on the yearly release model."
Had this problem as well you gotta like deactivate your PS4 account I�m not sure to be exact sounded like to much work so I didn�t do it
I got it to work by unlinking my battlenet from activision and then relinking
IQ 2000
I laughed so hard I dont even know why
so did my teammates in voice chat
I see people are upvoting this but no one is commenting why is that? Am I the only one who�s going through this issue??
"No, you are not alone. Sound is absolut broken.

  
Dead Silence: Console can hear it louder as PC  
Bomb defuse: if i sit close to bombspot i cant even hear defuse, i m more far away i can clearly hear it  
Footsteps: ahahahahahaha hear most time wrong side, headset is in right direction ;-)  
Footsteps2: sometime hear enemy only the last 2 steps close to me, most time i die

etc. etc. etc."
"It's not broken. It's the SBMM system that caters to lesser players. It raises or lowers sound levels, among other things. I've been killed countless times because an enemy heard my guy scream ""reloading"" when I didn't reload. If you think I'm wrong, go make a cheese account and play it for a few hours to get the stats established. I made one and screwed around for a day using a riot shield and combat knife. I would blow myself up like 10 times at the start of each match to make sure I went negative. 

My normal account is a 1.53 kd and my cheese account is a .70 kd. Can't hear shit on my main. I'm basically daredevil on the cheese account. I can hear anything and everything from absurd distances. Same exact audio settings on both accounts. The best part is that they literally patented a system that is meant to do that kind of stuff word for word, and people just shrug it off and say you're bad."
"So back when the game came out, the footsteps were super loud, like hearing them across half the map kind of super loud.

So people complained and complained and IW addressed it by reducing the volume but people continued to complain.

So one day, IW in their infinite wisdom, not only did further reduce the volume of footsteps, they MASSIVELY INCREASED SOUND OCCLUSION.

For those who don't know what sound occlusion is: It's how objects in a 3d space block sound.

They couldn't just slightly increase it. No no no no. They had to go balls deep so they went from footsteps that were unplayably loud to footsteps that are unplayably silent. It's not really the volume that's the issue, it's the massive inconsistencies due to super sound occlusion."
"Same issue I've had for months. Not a problem until I got the ps5. Mine is disk version and it would constantly delete my multiplayer packs. I got to a point where I just gave up and deleted the game, downloaded the free version of warzone and I'll just play that now. No multiplayer is still better than getting pissed off multiple times a week. Best of luck in finding a fix."
No idea how to fix this. I just play MW on PS4 and everything else on PS5. Couldn't deal with that BS.
Do you have cold war? I noticed this happens immediately after I finish cold war and try to go back to MW. Or if I try to use the menu links to launch the other game
"I�ve been having this happen to me in warzone a LOT 

I�ll be running with a teammate my game will lag so hard it freezes and just stops mid fight or mid run then resume 


I�ve also rubber banded twice through the same door the first time it didn�t even register I opened the door the second it did 


My wifi was acting weird but after Xbox came back online it felt *slightly* better"
"I once dealed with major rubber banding and even lagging out every game i played. I fixed the issue with a LAN cable, highly reccomended."
Nice job bro. I'm getting closer every day.
Good luck! The launchers are a pain
How does ur MW look so good??
Series x :)
replace the transmission fluid
"nice vehicle bgm.

perfectly matched"
how
Can you please do one post for each season video? It's porn to my eyes
"Nostalgia

I also miss the original 3 tab menu screen with the short videos that played over each. Saw a clip of it recently and it took me right back to playing shoothouse 24/7 when it released, or trying to figure out how tf to get good at ground war lol."
You mind sharing your secrets about the last one?
I miss when this game was just Modern Warfare
"Lmao no thanks 725, claymores and m4"
I have PTSD from the claymores in that era of Modern Warfare
"As someone who ran 2x claymores and smoke or flash on shoot the ship back then, this brings me joy."
"They just couldn't let it die with dignity.

I relish the fact that CW suckers are gonna be bitching nonstop when it happens to CW in 6 months."
"But we're kind of bitching about CW being forced down our throats, no? They'll bitch the same about CoD 2021 being forced down their throats."
I miss this screen. .-.
I do remember that! feels like an eternity since the game was like that.

"This looks so much more creative than a a static fucking photo. 

God I miss it so much, along with the videos that play for each separate mode."
Old times always were better.
Was a simpler time that was more enjoyable
Modern Warfare was that other call of duty ive spent most of my time on other than BO2 looking back now it really opens up my love for COD ile stick with it through thick and thin
I actually prefer the multiplayer in Cold War. The multiplayer maps on Modern Warfare (2019) are the worst out of any Call of Duty game I�ve played. Warzone has gone downhill though since the Cold War integration.
Warzone has definitely gone downhill imo.
"Exactly the same thing ay. Modern Warfare was�to me�the best COD in a decade, and Cold War�s engine alone made it a downgrade, then the overall laziness of the game really pokes out, with everybody sharing finishing moves, no saveable blueprints, the graphical downgrade, and it ruined Warzone as well as MW as they tried to make Cold War the people�s champ by force. It�s sad, and I�m honestly fed up at this point. I don�t want another COD until 2023. But that�s unrealistic. However, so is making yet ANOTHER CoD that will have to fit into Warzone and inevitably alienate the previous games� fanbases yet again."
"yes bro, I just played some of the free CW Zombie and some TDM, no way I'd pay for that game!"
I think a large part of current players of MW multiplayer feel so
"Both games are fine, both games have different audience and both studios have their own visions. So comparing them are meaningless. MW partial traded gameplay for mostly realism and details. CW traded realism for gameplay. Please, this sub is about people sharing their opinion about MW, this is not a CW dissing sub, respect that. I wish moderator would actively delete post like this, the rants about the intergration and the ads rants. It�s like there is at least 10+ posts everyday of people dishing out the same dann thing."
This.
"Love the kar98, looks so good in gold too"
Holy hell it looks like your sensitivity is on 4. Mine's 20 with zoom multipliers maxed
This is sensitivity 9 on console out of 10.
TWIIIIRRRRLL AROUND AND RE-ALIGN AWWW YEEEEEE MOTHER FIN TRICK SHOT
Lol I play on console at 30fps with a controller I�m not pretending to be good. This was fun for me since I suck so I shared. Eat a thousand dicks you middle class dweeb.

Yeah and my dad bill gates says the next Xbox has been worked for 3 years already
"Lol alright, if I�m wrong I�ll eat my fuckin GPU"
You mean MW2 2
Jeff Leach let slip that they're filming for mw2 this summer. Surely that means 2022 release date? Mocapping must be done early in development right?
2K does mocap every single year; I highly doubt they do it in the previous year.
">I can�t give away who told me

Because they don't exist."
because people who work on these projects have to sign an NDA

so its still not sledgehammer games you say?
Sledge is working on a game for this year and IW is releasing theirs 2022

More .... Moreeeee. Mwuahh hahaha
!remindme 6 months
Can you give a answer as to if it will be �intergrated in to warzone and all these cod�s like they are now with one unified progression and cosmetic system that�s what I wanna know
bring back F2000 or go home
Hype?? How can you feel  the hype when Activision is releasing broken games after games with only 1 year cycle for each game. If this is the way they are treating MW 2019 no point getting MW 2 2021.
"I mean this is basically how it's always worked. Game A releases and the majority of the dev crew immediately move to work on Game B, while a skeleton crew stays behind to do upkeep on Game A. This is part of why patches and extra content for Game A take forever to release."
intervention
Yawn. The SBMM is only going to get more and more aggressive as time passes. I find it hard to be excited for any new cod game knowing that to be the case.
Lemme guess... his names blake
"Cap, basically been confirmed sledgehammer are making it"
"I strapped a sniper scope onto a grau and kitted it out for speed and hipfire accuracy (drifter barrel, no stock, 5mw laser, sniper scope, 50 rounders) and ran around HC shipment like an idiot. Finished out almost all of sniper reticles using an AR on hardcore. You don't actually need to ADS unless you're doing longshots and mounteds and if you're doing those challenges I used the scar and M4 w 10 round mags"
"very cool, thank you! I'm just trying to get a cleaner sight for my snipers in Warzone. So is there a variable zoom that works on ARs or is it better to just do those steps with a Kar98?"
"All xp tokens, new or old, seem to be missing now due to a bug"
"Crap MW is full of bugs now, recently the fixed a bug of guns getting stuck in the same level, because we were no getting any type of XP, and now this."

Wow I did not know that thank you!
Lolz

I hate grinding for Damascus but there is nothing else to play but there�s just an urge to grind for it
I start by trying to grind for Damascus and then get bored by camping/ mounting and go to my default Style. I can't keep up for much doing grinding.
That�s exactly how I�m feeling. Was on BOCW for a bit but I got tired of that pretty fast.
Still a buggy piece of shit I see.
I was so confused and excited at first :(
I get the point but man you need to practice your aim
[removed]
On the PS Store there are Cold War CoD points and MW CoD points. Not sure if that�s the problem.
Thing is i didnt get the cod points in either game
Do the same thing again. Ps store support and activision supoort. Chances are someone took your ticket and didn't give a fuck. You might find a better customer service with an other dude!
will be sure to give that a try
Happened to me months ago. I contacted Xbox support and Activision support. Got no response from Activision but Xbox redeemed like half of what I bought and didn�t authorize the other half. I was pissed hopefully it works for you
what system
Ps4
"xbox has been down all day, if youre on Xbox then thats the problem"
"Call your credit card company? No idea if that�ll work or not, but just tell them you were charged and never received the item you bought."
"I used my credit card to buy psn gift cards first , so i did recieve what i bought, but after i used the money from my gift cards, i didnt get my cod points"
Did you ever get your points dude?
Sadly not yet
[deleted]
It's just messed up to all the dedicated players who no life's the game. Hopefully same thing happens to cold war
"It is pretty ridiculous. If I put in the MW disc and pick the MW application, that means I want to play MW. I don't want to play warzone or cold war, yet I have to scroll past both."
Activision knew the game was gonna be shit so they're  advertise hard on cold war lol
"You are wrong. 

We paid $60 bucks for WZ, and for free we had the campaign, MP and Co-Op."
"You sir, might be a genius ahead of your time."
But warzone is free and separate from MW? You can play warzone without spending $60.
"I�m confused, they aren�t letting play MW?"
"Yea sorry, the original title was I don�t want to play Warzone, but it was removed because the bot said it was a Warzone focused post so it didn�t belong here. But I disagreed because the main focus is MW. But I just had to change the title. 

It�s not that I can�t play MW I�m just annoyed they force Warzone on you so heavily. It wastes my storage"
Google says Xbox has been down for many hours
"Even tho I use google for many things, I would�ve never thought to use it for this situation. Thanks mate"
"Servers are down and theres no sign of them coming back on any time soon. I have a solid connection running 350mbps via ethernet and Modern Warfare, Cold War and Warzone are all not connecting. Issue ongoing and has been for about 2-3 hours for me. Please update on here if you manage to connect. Seems to just be Xbox."

Well the serac comes with the soap bundle so it wouldn�t be a battle pass blueprint.
Which is why I believe there won�t be a battle pass :( but we can hope riiiggght

He didn't say that. He said there won't be a battle pass in season 7.
Thats lo. Thats real lo.
What�s that finishing move?
Charlys default execution
Wow............. .... .. .... ..
Sorry for the potato quality
"MW will continue to have updates, but nothing of the update will be for MW."
"No, sadly the last bit of content might be soap showing up and the few new weapons I hope we get to use.  On the other hand. How have you long Cold War? I�m curious as I hate it. Got dm ultra was up to 30,000 in the world for multiplayer and then couldn�t enjoy the game. I�m just curious as I just despise the game now"
"I've had Cold War for about a month and I personally really like it, but it's my first cod game so I don't really have anything to compare it to. I've played WW2, Ghosts, Bo3, and a bit of the MW2 remaster, but I only played them a bit and never owned them."
"I played mw heavy before coldwar launched, after kinda merged the two it caused massive netcode issues for me. Cold war runs very smooth without issue, MW/Warzone i get over packet issues which is almost unplayable for me. I pray for an update to fix it but sadly i dont have hope. Fingers crossed on everything."
"Ouch, that sounds like it really sucks. Hope they fix it or at least do something to help with it."
"Dosen't look like it will stay alive at all. Se the last two season patches have been just CW stuff. No battlepass, no new content. Actually a month ago when they patched the unlimited tactical glitch they fucked up the xp system and aimassist on console. Even the hit markers disapeared randomly. Took them 2 weeks to try to fix it but to this day my aim assist still disapeares out of nowhere and some people don't get XP. So no new attachments even as a new player.

So yeah. MW was an amazing game but i personnaly wouldnt buy it in the state it is right now. I bought it at the beginning of season 1 and i'm very disapointed myself."
"Eh, I'm still probably gonna get it, but thanks for the input"
Xbox is having issues on their end.
Thanks buddy!! I�ll take a look and see if PSN is also having issues. My friend on PC is having it too so I�m curious. Also maybe feel like they are lagging the servers to �point� people to play Cold War
My Xbox and therfore the game hasn't been working for like 4 hours for me. Anyone else?
"Bro I am on pc and the lag for me becomes insane.    The  game I was on completely crashed ( everyone in the game left) yes I am on servers with 20/40ping but it becomes Insaneeeee.    
Our servers are messed up"
"Yeah bro, I�m so upset. I�ve been killed by lag. I�ll be behind walls and get sniped in the head when I�m around the corners or behind anytbing. I really hope hot fixes fix this shit. I�m behind fucking angry now"
Same- I�ve been kicked out of Warzone multiple times over the past 24 hours and with some lag. Haven�t been able to login to Warzone or Black Ops for about 2 hours now
"I�m assuming that the game registered the bolt going through the window and hitting the target, even though it didn�t. That�s a weird one for sure."

"Xbox is down, I can't connect to play my gamepass games."
Same it sucks not being able to play online or gamepass either. Guess I�ll play MW offline in the meantime
It�s happening to me as well and just got in Reddit to verify I wasn�t the only one either after resetting and hard rebooting
"Same here, it�s down atm.

https://downdetector.ca/status/call-of-duty/"
oh ok thanks
I�m on Xbox I can login to other games just not MW or BlackOps
They don�t require the connection to run.  The activision games do unfortunately.
Xbox is completely down and Microsoft has blocked the possibility of reaching a human.
Cold War is complete garbage I want to buy a disk copy and shit on it and then put gasoline on it and burn it to ashes.
"I played the ""free trial"" aka the open beta and that was more than enough for me to decide to never buy it. I'm not wasting any additional bandwidth on cold war.

The core game itself was the turnoff for me and no amount of patches or new content will change that."
"Thats exactly how I feel. I played the beta because not gonna lie, the trailer for the game pulled me in but after playing it, it felt like such a huge downgrade compared to MW. That convinced me that I'll never buy it and I LOVE zombies."
I'm playing the Trial but MP is utter garbage. Zombies is great tho
I can�t even access the download for the trial. It just takes me to the store to buy effing CW
It's complete shit. It's a step backwards. The graphics are horrible and nothing like MW. I can't wait for the next new game.
The worst thing is - you're unable to play split-screen online unless you own the game! Absolute garbage... after countless hour in mw we wanted to check if its worth buying - can't even test it in the free trial...
"Almost nobody play the fucking free to play access multiplayer before and no one will play this now.

During MW time, I played the free MP weekend and I bought it because I love it."
A lot people played the free to play access to multiplayer the last times. What are you talking about?
"My partners game wouldn�t load. Kept saying network error. And then after hard resetting a few times, he got in. But we played as 6 and it kicked us out a few times, muted certain people. It was an nightmare, we called it quits in the end."
"Yeah that�s ridiculous. 
Like most people I don�t really get time to play. So when I do and then I can�t like this it becomes so frustrating."
It's not them it's xbox as a whole they are having major outages I know I'm bummed
"Is that what is happening right now 
I can�t play mw all it�s saying js a network problem"
Go outside man
"The sub is *about* a video game....I came home from work and wanted to play, �man� but thanks for the asinine wannabe condescension. Nice try at even the tiniest bit of wit lmfao."
"Yep, at least for me, it went from being able to choose them, to reset them making a random mission assigned and now they're gone"
"It looks like the MW missions were removed from Warzone.  I was working on the sniper rifle blueprint and poof, gone."
Yeah most MW missions were removed. Not sure why but I noticed it too when I checked to see if they added anything new. They used to just always leave the old ones up to complete at any time. I dont have many Warzone missions anymore either. They may have removed those as well. Probably to push Cold War.
Yep all gone and it really pisses me off why remove something that gives ppl a goal or time to play on your game
My theory is Missions are going to be updated to include the PS4 ones across all platforms:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lmzlnr/release\_the\_hounds\_of\_hell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lmzlnr/release_the_hounds_of_hell/)

"Well just Check WZ, all of the MW gear has been put in WZ"
There is a cx-9 blueprint in the groundloot
The only thing I wish on March 11th is to finally delete warzone from my MW game
THIS
"wow, will that be possible?"
"Why killhouse? I�ve seen literally no one ask for this map. The lack of maps brought from MW2 is absurd. Everyone would love highrise, estate, even terminal which is one that was always brought back for every IW game except this one."
Those maps make a lot more sense for the next Modern Warfare.
"They�re probably saving the MW2 maps for MW2 2021-22, shit MW2 could be better than MW2020 if they keep the new engine"
Estate man. That was my favorite map on MW2 .
Sub base. Invasion. Rundown. Favela.
THIS. Even hust one or two of the maps mentioned would bring back the feels :(.
"They really should've balanced the remasters more across the three games, but I do think they really wanted to capture more of the COD4 feel in this game. We will most likely see more from the other games in the sequel."
Ngl I've never liked High Rise. Always thought it was one of the weaker MW2 maps along with Rundown (rundown is awful)
"Because it�s been in verdansk since warzone launched like broadcast and scrapyard and that�s the only map we don�t have for 6v6. And killhouse is always welcomed that map was a fan favorite when it dropped so I�m looking forward to it plus it�s a small map we need a killhouse, rust, shipment and shoothouse playlist."
"As much as I want more content, I want better weapon balance too. Last time we had that all they did was add some ads time on lapua spr that's now the best reg map sniper in the game and fixed infinite wallbang as val.  And this was in S6. They actually need to nerf and buff more weapons."
"I think balancing is in a pretty good spot. The only outliers are the AS VAL (3 shot kill out to 40 metres is absurd) and maybe the SPR, but honestly it doesn't seem that bad to me. 

All the other guns are balanced pretty much perfectly IMO."
"Cautiously optimistic I'd say, please for the love of whatever, Activision please let IW do this final content drop with a loud bang and then let us move on"
"Its depend on what game mode and what kind of person you are, i care about the w/l more, so i sacrifice my kdr for it. I play Hardpoint or Domination moat of the time (when there isn't shoot the ship.
My kdr is 0.88, Spm 373.8 W/L is 1.15 and 235608 kills with 79 days of gameplay (+10 days on my brother account for 2nd damascus).

[here ](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/profile/xbl/Aminbahrani47/mp) is my full stats if u need."
I only play ground war as a sniper. I never try for camos. Way too much effort for a slim l skin
"I'm guessing it will depend on what type of gamemode you play most of?

Edit: I mostly play HC Dom and my stats:

"Definitely I play hardcore dom, and play B primarily. A K/D of one is what I aim for."
I only play ground war
I believe JGOD has a video discussing K/D brackets.
"holdup there is split screen ?? probably never going to get fixed , they are starving this game ( content and fixes ) plus it doesn't involve warzone ( i think )"
"This was the main reason I brought MW, and now its not working at all"
I make the same question but for the performance.
lol
I ask myself this question every day
Might be addressed during 3/11 WZ update
"Weren't the op missions a bug? Accidentally assigned to everyone, don't track for those who don't actually own them."
Fuck activision. This doesn�t even earn them money. Sadistic fucks just want us to suffer for trying to enjoy modern warfare
"I don�t exactly know what they�ve removed, but I guess it�s working for them. I preordered CW only to be disappointed. So I went straight back to MW. Last night after the update I decided to see what the new map was like on CW. I actually had more fun playing it than I have on MW in the last couple weeks. Don�t get me wrong I still like MW better and I think it�s smoother and plays better. But in the measurement of just overall fun, In the last 24 hours I�ve been drawn to CW."
"CW MP is utter garbage, I can't stand it"
"Gotta agree. I got it as a Christmas gift from a friend, and let's just say I'm glad I didn't buy it. All of mw's problems with sbmm and the like, but no soul."
i feel like my friend is gaslighting me. even at 60fps it looks like a janky slideshow and the animations are so fucking ugly. feels last-last-gen
"It's because you can counter camping in modern warfare if you know how to play:

* Use FMJ to shoot through walls in camping spots

* Snapshot grenades are broken, if the other player is using the battle hardened perk, it still shows the icon, so you know some one is near by

* Most tactical do something here, in CW with the tactical mask you are literally inmune, so yeah you cannot be flushed out in CW

* Molotov & thermite are pretty good to flush out players behind cover, in CW I think I've never died from a molotov. You can use rockets too in MW, something so useless in CW

* Most maps have a lot of ways to reach the objective, so if you keep dying you can either kill the enemy now that you know where he is or take a different route

The problem here is that all of above requires you to think and ""try"" more than the usual, while most people playing cod expect to just run and kill, something which I respect but I really love how MW19 is, something that seems to be rare..."
"I remember looking at a killcam on Satellite, and seeing how my flash grenade did absolute jack to the other guy, and then he quickscoped me before I could finish him with my AR."
"I never understood the argument that it's more common in 2019 than Cold War.

I mean, almost EVERY design decision in Cold War is built to make the game punish movement:

- Sprint-Out being among the slowest in the series (up there with pre-overhaul WWII)

- LMGs and Tac Rifles don't conform to the slower TTK, and they're naturally less ""I'm going to run around"" type guns

- Snipers are literally uncounterable head on.

- Field Mic

- Flak Jacket might as well making you invincible against explosives, so it's impossible to flush people out.

- No FMJ equivalent (in terms of wall-banging)

- Perk Greed is free, and gives an extra perk slot for all 3 categories.

- Stims recharge without Quartermaster (same concept as Restock in MW, for those not aware)

Really your only penance is Ninja always being active, and to a VERY small extent, Ghost only being while moving. But Modern doesn't have nearly as much camping. Why? Simple, few to none of these issues are there. Mounting is a free kill to whoever can beam your exposed face, so the people who do it are generally going for challenges, and people LOVE to over-exaggerate how doors work, since they don't really change too many scenarios.

Damn, I needed to get that out."
It's the same the only time MW was really bad was when the 725 and claymore restock wasCamper OP That being said I only play a select few maps.
"Are we really still complaining about ""campers"" in 2021? You die to them once, you now know where they are. Use some utility for a free kill, better yet, prefire them. I can't believe that people are still complaining about free kills."
I like campers. It gives me an objective and a target for a couple thermites or arrows
But if there�s two campers in two lanes of the map then that limits where you can go greatly which makes it shit
"Camping is an issue in just about every CoD ever if you listen to players at the time each version was popular. We all generally look back with rose tinted glasses thinking or favorite versions of the game were near perfect. 

<sarcasm> They need a game mode that disables standing still or walking. Not like cranked. Only sprint and its permanently pressed for you. Running into a wall or object to not move makes you take damage as well. Give these people what they really want. No ADS either, you know thats for pussies. </sarcasm>"
It used to be if you camped in one spot long enough you became visible in the radar to the whole map
"Game is definitely ass and looks like it. 

That is actual camping. Thing I always say is if they doing it u just gotta take em down"
"I've been playing CoD since, well Call of Duty, and really heavily since CoD4 and MW19 is one of the better ones when it comes to campers. 

I dont run into them very often save for backwall and office/junkyard campers on shoothouse."
"Yeah, ironically (given this sub's general map preferences) it's actually Shoot House I encounter the most ""campers"" on, and definitely the ones that are most difficult to dig out."
"i�ve seen campers in both games, i wouldn�t say Mw is full of campers, but it was designed for camping, or, as the devs say �tactical gameplay� cold war is a game i�ve obviously seen less campers because i played less, but when i see it�s on an easier lobby, on hard lobbies everybody rushes"
"Because BOCW are full of shitty bot players that couldn't take MW's TTK and they kept dying and losing, then they started making that argument.

Just hop in BOCW lobby, many of them are fucking bots"
BOCW is filled with sweats with Faze in their tag thinking they are in a pro league match.MW is filled with people sitting in a building with a claymore or proximity mine with Ghost.
MW discourages movement. The fact that they don't have dead silence as a perk and you don't have to move for ghost to work all leads to slower game play.
The people who say this act like camping only exists on cod mw
"#Spycraft

^(that�s literally all you need, it�s sitrep on steroids and spotter combined)"
I feel like what made MW feel campier was how a lot of game design decisions benefited campers. I�m not saying you can�t counter them in MW but I have an easier job doing it in CW if I ever have to.
For me it feels like counter a camper in MW is easier as in CW because of the lower ttk
The campers are the same to me in both games. Unless you play ffa.
It�s because MW maps except for a few exacerbate the camping problem with 100 sight lines and one pathway camp spots. CW maps are simple with a few head peaking spots and camping spots. I like the flow of CW gameplay but I prefer NW overall guns and visuals.
I don�t mind people camping in game every now and then. it�s the dick bags that constantly run to the same spot after they die that annoy me. it�s like they�re mad that you killed them while they were camping and decide to be sore losers about it lol.
"COD = Call of Duty.
WRONG!!!!
COD = Campers on Duty"
COD = come on Dorris
"I only play Headquarters and, Cyber Attack and Search and Destroy. In Headquarters if you camp (and you aren't near the objective) you are absolutely of no help to your team and probably aren't getting kills cause all of the action is happening near the HQ. So I don't see many campers in there. And if I do I just simply ignore them.

Camping in SnD and CA is common though, but that's kind of the nature of the mode. It's always been that way.

I will say though, there is a lot of camping in TDM, but in a game mode where kills and deaths are actually important I don't blame them.

All in all, outside of TDM/FFA I haven't witnessed the amount of camping in MW that everyone claims there is. My lobbies are full of run-and-gunners for the most part."
To be honest I prefer battling campers in a better game than battling the biggest sweats ever in a bad game. Campers are easy to deal with
I bought BOCW I switched back to MW tho. I gotta say there are more campers in black ops but not by much. On free week there are a lot of new players and they camp a lot
"eh, how I see it is:
both games got campers. cold war is just hella worse with them."
"If you're not running around like a headless chicken, COD kids will call you a camper."
"CW was one of the campiest cod experiences I've ever had, the amount of shotgun camping and claymores was insane. I went back to MW and couldn't play because CW had made me so fucking paranoid and play so bitchy I vowed not to play CW again once I got my grove in MW again."
I honestly think the camping is worse in mw imho. Trying to play snd on maps like grazna or Piccadilly give me a headache.
"In some ways, shit war is actually less encouraging of campers.  The killstreak system is stupid as filling your asshole with sand, but this one has only 3 worthwhile streaks (whiskey dick, jugman, and harrier strike) that take 8 kills or more.  Players did really fast so they have to be much more cautious.

My limited time in shit war showed me that people do not have to be cautious as everyone gets their streaks by the middle of the match and then the only problem is waiting for clear skies to call them in."
"You need to be the king of all smoothbrains to call MW a campers game. 

BOCW with its shitty TTK promotes camping 10x more then MW."
Because it is true they designed all mp maps to be camper friendly
"All cods got at least a camper spot in all the maps. The campers are the problem, not the maps. They could even find a camper spot on shipment."
3 lane maps = easier to camp
"6x6 and 10x10 is pretty bad. Maps are too big and porous. I only play FFA and Gunfight. FFA is bad some days too. Running around looking for something to shoot at. MW is fun but the next one needs to encourage movement. 

I hate CW but at least it promotes movement. If not for the game being so buggy, graphics mediocre, terrible scorestreaks, cranked up SBMM, the game could have been better than MW."
"Me in coldwar: (*sits at the balcony with a sniper*) 

Also Me in Coldwar Warzone: Camps in corner with a streetsweeper.


No joke When I see realistic military feel I'm surprised you aren't camping for 3 days. 

(*points to marines*) in the middle east they sometimes have to camp a location for days."
there is a slight difference between dying IRL and respawning in-game
I don�t want to play war zone or Cold War so why do I have to do a 90gb update for something I�m not even receiving. I now have 0 other games on my ps
"There is no justifiable reason for these updates being so large.  Where is that space going to?  It�s not going towards game critical content!  It�s all just graphics fluff.  Who needs that crap?

Maybe some people enjoy all those skins and decals.  Good for them, they should be free to downloads 100s of GBs of content every update.

The rest of us should be able to flip a switch that forces the game to use a much simpler subset of textures etc.  Players should also not be blocked from network play over this crap.  How idiotic is that?  

The consoles should really step in here and regulate these developers from doing wtf they want to do."
Its large because playstation updates are large. 2/3x what pc and xbox get.
"i bought an external harddrive (i shouldn't have to though)

sony needs to start releasing consoles with WAY MORE STORAGE. this shit is getting ridiculous"
"Or, or or... Sony needs to place storage space constraints on game developers.  There is literally justifiable reason why these updates need to be this large."
"PS4 Pro has a 1tb storage which might seem big but is also small.

I want a PS5 but the digital version has only 835gb of storage, which seems really weak for a next gen console especially at the price it's being sold for."
Which packs can you delete if you online play the online modes?
I think Survival and Co-Op?
"Well maybe if they allowed us to uninstall Warzone and CW content like any other content then that wouldn�t be a problem. Right now, with only MP packs downloaded, my game is 176 GB on my PS4 Pro. That�s 70+ of Cyberpunk and like 50+ than RDR2. It�s fucking insane."
Wow this is frustrating
"Fuck this shit, I'm uninstalling and throwing this game back to GameStop..."
I had to buy external memory in order to play 1/3 of what I had to download. Pretty shitty of you ask me
"Realistically, If you play any games other than CoD, you�d probably need an external drive anyway considering how large games are nowadays. Unless you go and delete them as soon as you finish them"
What other games do you play that are more than 100 GB?
"I'm not defending Activision I'm just saying so people know. You can get an external 1tb hard drive for like $50. You don't need to be a wizard to set it up either, you just plug it into a USB port on your console."
Yea but you shouldn't have to spend money on extra storage just because a billion dollar company doesn't know how to properly manage space
">No, I won't want to buy an external hard drive because that's stupid. 

So there's literally one solution out there that you refuse to take because you think the devs aren't compressing their games enough.

And people wonder why devs don't ""listen"" to you guys. It's a joke how uneducated some of you people can be."
"That�s not what OP is saying. The perception is that the developer wants you to spend more money on an external just to play their game. These games are already are expensive and now they are saying �just go out and spend more money�. To most of us, this is not a profession like photography, where a person spends money on larger storage. This is a game. Simple as that. We shouldn�t be told we need to delete other games we spent hard earned money on just to play their game. It�s just facts. Personally, I don�t have an issue with the size. I keep very few games on my box as it is. I�m in the minority but I understand the frustration."
"It�s 2021. Games are going to be large in file size, since you are on a old console you can either: Delete this game or other games you aren�t playing, delete modes from modern warfare, get an external hard drive because they are not that expensive, or just upgrade to a higher storage console"
It�s 2021 true but they brought the game to PS4 so that comes with responsibilities...many people paid lots of money for DLC and now they are screwing them over.....
You can�t uninstall Warzone because it is Modern Warfare. It�s literally made up of modern warfare ground war and spec ops maps. This argument is so weak.
"Don�t care, not poor"
cringe
That's the thing about poor people always saying they aren't poor
Boom I've used my alpha male status to intimate this beta gamer and scared him off now he knows better then to mess with a alpha
Just looking at your comment history tells me what kind of ass you are constantly bitching about console players being poor or trash and almost all of your comments have been downvoted to hell jesus christ go outside
I just want that rainbow Oden bundle that I waited an entire season for and it never arrived
Hope so I have being waiting for the Texas chainsaw bundle to come back but since I mainly play warzone they just have 3 rows of CW stuff versus jus one for MW
Yes I want the saw one Litterlly just for the blue print.
"If you go to the armory and the blueprint for the gun is there, you can buy the bundle that way."
"What's shown to me now is four rows for CW and four for MW, have you played after the update?"
[deleted]
All I want is the Samuri Ronin skin and I'm good
Yeah Samurai Ronin seems to be [the best bundle](https://youtu.be/QursWQw9KGE) to come
"They were found in the files yes, but this game is out of its life cycle so it�s very possible we will never see them in game. I highly doubt there will be another MW season, sadly. If anything a small content dump of all of the data mined items around the release of the new WZ map and that�s it. We�re almost to this games 2 year anniversary so I�m sure the next IW cod is already in development."
"Not necessarily a new season per say, it's just as you mentioned additional content. It's evident that, in terms of sales, MW is beating BOCW in almost every way possible. 

I'm not sure about the popularity of MW's bundles, but if you check IW's devs� accounts, it seems clear, to me at least, that the leaked bundles are heavily demanded (Roze's, the one that was just released, was one of which)"

"Man this sub is getting cringy as fuck lately. You bitches spent ALL YEAR crying about MW and how bad it was and now that CW is out you guys post nonstop about how MW gets no attention. Cod has been doing yearly titles for almost 20 years (with some rounding), they have made BILLIONS, they do not give a single fuck about battlefield. I just need to leave this sub before reading all of these posts drives me insane. Also, you guys sound like youtubers with these very dramatic titles"
"I love CoD but honestly the CoD cycle is getting tiresome. Every year it�s the same thing. Trailer drops, everyone gets hyped all to hell, game drops, everyone bitches about it for a year and says how amazing the last one was, repeat forever.

Cold War, I�ll admit, is not a very good game. The campaign was okay but MP is just not really fun. I get that sucks but it doesn�t mean that suddenly a game you spent 12 months complaining about is a masterpiece. I did enjoy MW more but that doesn�t mean it wasn�t without its flaws."
"> and now that CW 

people know how good they had it. CW is *shit*"
lmao yeah they bitched and complained anout camping in mw and now they bitching how it gets no attention
"Those people already moved on from mw. The ppl who stayed actually like this game thats being left to rot. 

And no I'm not bitching about lack of content. I'm bitching about how acti has made server performance suffer greatly since CW beta, how weapon balance is still a joke after s6 weapon drop.

No they don't give a single shit about us. That's why even long time fans and YouTuber like xclusiveace has said they're pretty much done with cod. A lot of life long cod players are just waiting for a competent competitor and they're out."
"Exactly my thoughts. This sub was full of hate posts 24/7 last year and I was always arguing with some person talking shit about MW. Fast forward to BOCW beta, the sub started praising MW like a god.

The reason for this is obvious tho...Most of the players who hated the game left for the new game and the fans stayed on the sub.

Personally, I enjoyed MW last year and I'm also enjoying CW. They are two different CoD games made by different developers. The two games play vastly different due to differences in mechanics and perks with MW being more tactical and CW being mroe fast-paced..."
"Speaking of modern warfare breaks, its telling me to sign in on the account that purchased it when im on the account that purchased it, and no other accounts work. could anyone help figure this out?"
Are you on xbox? They�re having major issues right now.
"Sounds like you got hacked dude. I hope that's not the case but it sounds like it. Search this sub for ""hacked""."
y'all need to hop on BF4. that game is STILL FUN (althoughing levelling is very difficult)
"I wouldn't claim Battlefield 6 will be a life saver either.

If anything, EA corporate ran the franchise to the ground and then some. Kinda exactly what's going on with Activision now..it's the corporate 3 piece suits that are making business decisions for CoD and probably don't even play the game.

But EA has leant the lesson and trying to revive the franchise back again so fingers crossed. Both MW and Blops are at the same crossroad where Battlefield 3/4 was.

Then whole franchise went downhill cos of corporate greed and non gaming business decisions."
What am I missing? How did they massacre it? They changed the menu again? Is MW not exactly the same as it was prior to Season 2? Genuine questions.
"i guess they have some mp data in WZ-s files

im thinking maps and such, since some of the mw maps are on verdansk"
"Pretty sure Verdansk GW maps were there before Warzone, plus spec-ops, they all took place in Verdansk."
"Yes, it's the CX-9, based on an Skorpion EVO.

There's also the RAAL MG (based on the SIG MG338) which is also currently unreleased but available as ground loot."
Just release them. Please for the love of all that is good in the world. The game deserves it.
"I picked up the RAAL and holy shit, that thing is disgustingly powerful, like Jesus Christ it's strong."
And the sykov (Makarovs pistol)
I think the RAAL is called the �Rook� ingame
Here comes the R6 flashbacks again
All the Plat and Diamond sweats using Ela. Good times
Went from unmatched to doodoo garbage with a high skill level
Copper to Plat in one season with Ela.
My roommate�s looted this a couple times and I�ve gotten the Raal a few times. I wonder if there�s a Sykov with the full auto barrel in chests
How do either of them play?
Scorpion Evo?
so glad your homie posed behind the gun like a massive fish y�all caught
what happened before?
With my crashing? I had an issue where as soon as I opened the games multiplayer mkdeif I didn't have graphics safe mode on I would crash. I could turn up the settings once I was in game but eventually dev error 6068 would pop up :/
got damn that was nice. I just recently started training myself to quickscope for my Damascus journey and its really fun.
"Thanks, going for obsidian for the Kar. First gold gun so it means a bit to me"
I like how this post is NSFW cuz he fucked everyone lmaooooo
"Me: Calls him out for hacking
Him: I'm just better than you, thanks for thinking I'm hacking"
"Xbox is out too. I thought it was just because xbox was having problems right now, it won�t let me sign in."
Im having the same problem on Xbox.
I�m on my PS4 Pro and it says I don�t have all the data packs even though I only have multiplayer packs downloaded and everything available for MP is installed already. They just love breaking the game.
Same issue here on PS5. I searched the subreddit to make sure I wasn�t the only one. Seems like they are literally trying to force us not to play MW.
There isn�t a ps5 version I thought
It�s the PS4 disc of modern warfare on a ps5.
Hope you all enjoy this video :) and have a wonderful day/night
Cold war ain't selling like MW did. Activision is doing everything to showcase it more than MW.
isnt that not actually true? didnt cold war sell even more copies than MW?
"It�s called getting fisted, no lube dry fisted! We are get fisted full blown iron man glove fisted! It�s like Mike Tyson doing punch bag training on our anus�s FUCK YOU ACTIVISION"
"Activision just wants their yearly dose of money. So much so that they make mw players suffer just in the hopes that one or two of us will �upgrade� to their mediocre, rushed piece of garbage that�s been spray painted gold."
Cw happened
Welcome to the unfortunate reality that is Activision and Treyarch being able to murder a great game just to advertise some 2013 game.
The end of Modern Warfare has happened...end of support for MW2019. Now everything is Cold War/Warzone.
"Acording to TGR, a very accurate leaker, something is coming on march 11"
Hardly the end. MW will be back even stronger when everyone gets tired of CW.
"They screwed the people who paid for mw 2019 and are going to continue doing so, although I'm really enjoying zombies but I'm still upset with their choice."
just a peek at the mw sub will explain everything
"I keep hearing voices in my head... Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated :|"
Activision is trying their best to force people onto Cold War because a ton of people either don't want to play it or don't like to play it.
"Yes, I would have bought CW if there are were any selling points, or something unique about it"
"Try using ds4windows, they recently updated it to be compatible with ps5 controllers. I played halo with my dual sense a few weeks ago so I don�t see why it wouldn�t work for call of duty too"
are you sure you have selected the input device in the settings?
that's the thing. the controller input option is completely locked for me
"It's dogshit. I had it working fine with the unreleased drivers, then suddenly mid game it decided to stop working and is refusing to reconnect. The controller works fine with everything else, so clearly it's Modern Warfare being the issue.

&#x200B;

My PS4 controller works fine."
Hey Xbox live is down right now. Activision is a pain to deal with so I feel your frustration but in this instance it�s just Xbox flopping lol
[removed]
"Haven't had to do this in a while nor do I still have it installed so I can't check but when you're at the main menu displaying campaign, multiplayer and all that look at the bottom of your screen, there should be a button prompt for data packs, find that and check there. Had this happen multiple times to me also, very annoying, good luck"
[removed]
Hey Xbox live is down right now so you�ll need to give it a lil bit. I know I�m frustrated too
"Ah of course alright, thanks for the reply"
Feels like crap I agree
"oh the live servers are down for some people, its rly annoying"
I can play Modern Warfare but can�t get to the Microsoft store cause apparently I need to download it
You have to download the full game from the app store. It�s annoying af. 200gb or whatever to play for a week.
is the same problem occurring on ps5 if you have an account on ps5 it does the same thing?
Idk I only have an Xbox
Or you can stay in the match and get 30 or 45 kills to double or triple up and add to the count.
"Dosent work for the sticks, but to be fair I haven't checked for obsidian"
Good news my friend. The mara default season 1 skins are avaibke in the store as vault packs as of tomorrow
Thank you sir!
"Just asking, but how do you know?"
I am Italian and still this bundle of the first season of Mara and the others does not come out to me why?
No problem. Although they are quite expensive but at least its a way to get the skins you are looking for. I really hooe they do the same with the later seasons
"so if you buy a battle pass operator but you miss out on their default skin, you only get the skin in the bundle but not the default skin?"
"Apparently, that�s how it is. I thought it would include the operator missions to unlock more. The missions were showing up for me when I first bought the pack, but now they�re gone."
"I just bought this skin to unlock Mara and I thought there would be more challenges to unlock her default skins, is my game bugged?"
"No

Dlc operators do not have base skins. They only include missions if it is included in the bundle"
"Her ""default"" skins are from the first battle pass, therefore..."
"Likely you are having the exact same problem as most of the rest of the world. They are having issues on the Xbox live side.

Go to your network settings and have it test multiplayer connection and chances are it will get done and say your connection is fine but they�re having issues on their end."
how long has it been happening?
Have you removed film grain and motion blur?
"I have. Yet I can't do anything about someone just standing still and blending in with the surrounding environment. I've been told to peek corners, but it seems like the only 2 outcomes are 1. peek, get shot when I do 2. Run and gun (the same way I've been killed countless times) except I get shot the second I get in the enemies view"
I usually change render resolution up to 135
What does this do?
I wonder why they changed it from long shots using the wooden stock?
That�s for the longer barrel
With uzi
Yeah I though that but it doesn't have the option for a 50rd mag on the uzi...
"if it was with a certain gun it would say in the challenge, try doing it with a gun other than the uzi and then see if it tracks progress"
"I tried with the KILO because I'm trying to level that yup aswell, still nothing..."
"Just build your Uzi to hip fire , the Uzi is actually good for hip fire . I used compensator , 5 mw laser , Merc grip , 50rd mag and no stock .very tight spread with that build ."
"How did you unlock the 50 round mags though, it's not showing up for me."
You need to level up the Uzi then all the attachments unlock .
level your gun to level 41 and you should get the 50 and mag and then do the challenge. They made it so you can't just get the good attachments w/o leveling the gun.
"Yeah, I just realised this after I made the post, I can't believe I'm such a dumbass."
r/lsd
"Turn on ps5, do not load mw go to setting and disconnect for wifi/ethernet, load up mw connect back to wifi/Ethernet enjoy playing.."
It's making me copy game content now?? wtf is even happening with this game ffs
You do that every time you launch the game? Even if you close the application and start it back up?
Have same problem. I reinstalled the game and didn�t happen anymore until today�s update.
"Saaame. 

I had to download the packs again for no reason last week, if it does it again, Imma delete Modern Warfare for good."
"it'll do it to you as well, there's no way it won't"
Anyone got a solution to this problem yet? Just finished downloading the update and now I can't even play smh
"Unfortunately not, you do have some spec-ops missions tho"
"Damn, that blows. Thanks."
How?   We have 3 players.  How do we play the SpecOps missions without a random joining?
There isnt a co op campaign but there is co op special ops
Is there a way to play these with 3 players and no randoms?
I keep getting a connection failed screen she I load the game up so I�m assuming servers are down
"My brother is playing right now 
I am just reinstalling the game right now I will tell you If it works"
same here Xbox services down or something
Xbox.com/status
Its not an Activision problem you dont have enough space on your harddrive essentially mw and warzone combine to be well over 400gb if i recall or its close to the 400gb spot thats why it stops you dont have the space for it unfortunately
I�m having the same issue and space isn�t the problem. MW is the only game on my 1tb Xbox.
So I cleared even more space (465 gb free) and I still can�t download just the 94gb part for the main game of modern warfare. I unchecked all the add ons and packs and it still says �installation stopped� immediately.
I�m having the same problem on ps5 is it some add on that is 16.287GB
Like my last comment depends how much space you have available warzone just had a big update along with cold war so if you dont have the space you cant download
"hey man the 725 slugs actually bang tho, it's just like a more fun sniper with soh"
Nothing wrong with a scoped 725
sorry if it's bad quality I saved it from my ps4 lol
I�ve been seeing scoped sawd off 735�s recently. Doesn�t make any sense.
"You mean ribbons? Yup, they're gone. MW doesn't exist anymore to Activision."
The ribbons had to be complete by season so now they are gone. And im pretty you can do the current seasons in mw.
"[Quick link to their twitter account here.](https://twitter.com/Python1202)

[This is also my personal favorite thing they made.](https://twitter.com/Python1202/status/1360207276275949569)"
2400 points just for THAT??!? Lmao what in the actual fuck is that robbery
wait till they put rook roze there... $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
It�s not a robbery if you are dumb. Beside 2k4 was like the standard pricing for store bundles until they have 500CP packs with useless shits.
"2.4k for skin with a mission for version of it, calling card, emblem and legendary watch? Kinda?"
"HIJACKING FOR VISIBILITY:

The store is still bugged when it comes to new Modern Warfare packs. This bundle, just like many in the last few weeks, does not show up for everyone. 

This recently happened with Roze until enough uproar was made on Twitter and they fixed it later that day. But it seems to have been only for that one pack and not a permanent fix. 

Most people are NOT aware but the following bundles have already been released:

Tacgas Lerch
Ronin Crimson Samurai
Domino Rainbow Tracers
Grinch Lion


The only operator skins remaining from the December update are Iskras White Chapel, Soap and Sparks. 

If we don�t raise awareness to this issue Soap is gonna be released just like all the others where only a few can see him in the store. 

It would really help if we could get a dedicated thread for this stickied to the top of this reddit so the developers who browse here can see this in time. 

Gonna be a lot of angry gamers within the next few weeks when Soap is supposed to release if this issue is still in the game. For reference it�s been like this since the end of December."
"They dont even need to make new content, just sell the old ones for the same price as a brand new one! Its so sad this works"
Imagine paying money for skins in a game that only has a 1-2 year shelf life before everyone moves on to the next title.
It�s a cosmetic. You don�t need it. They can charge whatever they want lol
Scamtivision loves robbing people blind.
Just give me season 3 milsim skins
What did you expect? These are rare items. You�re lucky you get a chance at it at all since it was originally billed as exclusive to each season.
[removed]
"Not nearly as many guns needed since the game shipped with little content. Also nuke town 24/7 has been live since it�s launch so anyone wanting to grind it has an easy 24/7 playlist that hasn�t gone anywhere since it�s inception.

Not sure what the average player will take time wise but I�m sure it�s a lot quicker than MW especially since we don�t have all the mounted kills as one of the camos."
It's still just nuts that in my first game I was facing the true sweats. Pretty goofy tbh.
"3 pistols (most of them are literally almost done), 3 lmgs (these are easy, I just don't like the ones I have to use. Thankfully lmg requirements are really low), all launchers still (jokr just needs attacker and defender kills, rpg needs support streaks still) and then kills while injured for the shield. I really am so damn close to getting it done but man...i play like 4 matches and get tired of doing it"
"Keep it up you can do it. You are near the end.

I did the anyoing ones first. A good map for the jokr is promenade (hope i write it correct in english). There are some good spots where you shoot directly on flags. Use smokes and hope someone stands there. Defend counts as long as you stand in a flag of your team. Needs a few matches but got it fast on that map compared to other maps"
But you didn�t shoot in the air while spinning at 100mph??
Yeah I just was relieved that it was finished at 2 or 3 am
"Hey man as someone who started Damascus and got it in the first month or 2 it feels easy afterwards right but I�ve had Cold War since launch day and it took me almost 2 weeks to finish the snipers alone and there are only 3, the guns take for ever to upgrade if your gonna do anything go for zombies camo"
Good to know. Thanks for the information. I try to get the zombie and if I find any motivation after that maybe I give it a shot (hopefully they do something about these challanges in that time)
U mean dm ultra or dark aether? Cus one is mp and the other is zombies
"First Dark Aether, because right now is zombie more fun for me and I think it looks better. DM Ultra maybe after that"
"All i have is a few ar�s, launchers and the fucking shield"
Shield is the worst. After that you run through them
All I have to do is the riot shield and the launchers. I am in complete hell. 3 kills with riot shield is near impossible.
I know what you mean. The shield was the worst weapons of all and took the most time. After that jokr and crossbow. Rest of the launchers was ok (rpg was a bit anyoing with the streaks)
Got the exact same problem for the past 8 hours. Still won't work :(
"Fixed it bro, saved me redownloading whole game.

https://youtu.be/cr6WknJYTGQ

Follow this tutorial, after you did everything in video last step �scan and repair� again, update will start. Cheers!"
Dont hipfire with marksmen/sniper style guns....you would have landed all your shots had you aim down the sight....
This kind of behavior really takes the fun out of the game. Is this a known exploit?
"Yea but you don�t run into a lot of people doing it, because it�s a dumb glitch lol"
"Those guys are idiots but you can just avoid them and steal their car and they'll lose the match lol. Not that effective for winning,just griefing"
"Cold War is such a terrible game, it's amazing.

I downloaded the free to play MP and lasted about 4 rounds of domination. I was trying to level guns for Warzone and said, fuck it I'll stick to plunder. 

It just.... Wasn't fun."
"The MP is awful, but both the zombies and campaign are really fun. New outbreak mode kicks ass

But man words cannot overstate how awful the MP is. I actually think it's even worse than BO4. At least BO4 felt like BO2 in HC"
"Damn bro, it�s funny cus y�all wouldn�t have bitched if this came out pre-MW , which is just a great value Battlefield. Idk why a sub for MODERN WARFARE bitches so much about COLD WAR.

You don�t like it? Shut up. I�m not here to see ppl complain about Cold War, I�m here for posts about MW."
The pyramid of adverts pyramid scheme
"Just wait until they drop Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War Zombies Season 2 Outbreak Ultra Plus, their new streaming platform"
Do you have to download the whole game to play the trial? If so. Pass
Agreed. I signed up for the trial and I�m about to check if I can play it or have to download another huge game. If I need to download the entire CW I�m just leaving it
It's pathetically funny and hilariously ridiculous.
Hahaha that does look pretty funny
& Knuckles...
This is honestly the worst modern warfare update we�ve had in my opinion. Barely anything applies to the game I actually paid for and preordered so in that case (paid EXTRA for). When will they stop this team up with Black Ops. Black Ops went downhill after Bo2. How can they make the best CODs ever then get so low!?
Call of duty black ops Cold War zombies outbreak origins remastered platinum collection featuring Dante from the devil may cry series (tm)

"Cold war is like modern warfares little brother, the one we never wanted..."
Its the Zombies outbreak event and its a free access week. How is this type of branding even remotely surprising?
lol I never said it was surprising. It�s just a naming abomination of 6 different tag lines all stacked up
Ah yes more zombies lag and broken p2p servers. I'd love to play zombies bc I dont like Multiplayer and I got it for free but being booted bc someone left or moving in slow mo bc their internet sucks is aggravating
Idk what you're on about that looks sick as fuck
Isent that the damascus skin when you die 100 times on each map in a single day?
oohh yeaa boofed the whole bag
"Go to your install folder, find all files updated later than Feb 22, and move them to the corresponding locations of the other PC.

I'll suggest to copy all files instead. It's not too much slower..."
"Just don�t. I know shit is hard right now (Texas literally has people playing CoD in their cars with hotspot). But for real, there is no way to do that and if you messed up, imagine having to redownload 200+ GB because Repair doesn�t do anything."
I mean worse case scenario I just copy the entire game. I have a slow hard external hard drive tho so I was hoping to just copy the update instead of entire game
I wouldn�t recommend doing that. The game is very particular about the files/integrity and if it detects modification of the wrong one it can trigger the anticheat. Not worth it imo.

...but it's possible? On PS at least. All modes are optional, they're made into ""DLC"" packs which are optional to install. Campaign packs, MP packs, coop packs. Can't get rid of Warzone though, that seems to be the core mode for whatever reason. I only have MP and it's roughly 150 gigs.

Anyone still have this issue ?
I still cannot and it says live
Yeh still the same
I just tried and can�t play it either.
Yes.
Same experience
I got the same Problem. Probably will take some few hours until they fix it.
"This game seems a ""fixing bugs simulator"" ."
The free event has not gone live yet.
Oh I guess that makes sense. Do you know when it goes live
Same thing happening to me
Mine is also doing this still even after installing the multilayer and base pack. Had the same problem last time it was free access.
"I figured it out, had this issue for a while
Open black ops free week
Go to zombies
Download zombies base pack
Open zombies
Go to outbreak"
"I just did the update, got season 2 and still no go"
"Yo I�m not sure why they did this but it isn�t under the outbreak tab , you have to open zombies and it�s there"
Same here. Tried reinstalling both Cold War and Warzone and still not working
I�m dumb. It�s just bad UI. The event happens inside the battle royale mode it�s just in a designated area
Same things happening too me and I have Cold War and mw with everything installed they need to fix this ASAP
same here...
"head over to the game store of whatever you're playing on and download the free version of cold war.

Example: playstation store: [https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0002-CUSA15010\_00-CODCWOBTRIAL0001](https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0002-CUSA15010_00-CODCWOBTRIAL0001)"
Ya still not working for me
Same. This is so ridiculous. It�s only out for 2 weeks & we�re missing out. How have they not fixed this issue yet.
I�m thinking you have to own Cold War? The only reason I don�t want to get Cold War is because I don�t have enough space on my Xbox...
"This is also happening for me, might try uninstall and reinstall warzone to see if it fixes"
Same
I've been having the same problem for the last two days as well. Did anyone find any solution yet?
Still not working for me either. I just downloaded 100gb of black ops to hopefully play it and still nothing....
"Go to battle royal 
Shipwreck is there"
Ohhhh that makes sense. The way they have it setup it looks like the outbreak is a playlist on warzone.
its the shipwreck but there are no zombies
"So I can download some 50+ GB for the privilege of installing Cold War and playing outbreak for ""free""? This when my ISP charges bigly for monthly overage?

No thanks."
"I got on cold war and checked that my zombies was ""partially installed"" i got an error trying to finish the download and just uninstalled zombies and downloaded it again. Try checking your file management. (Currently waiting to see if it worked)"
I did that - it didn't work. then I removed both COD and war zone and reinstalled. Checked all of the additional add-ons and reinstall those too. doesn't work. You can play zombies mode within the Cold War game - but not in war zone. just takes us to the purchase page and then tells us we already purchased the stupid thing
I�m still having this problem
"I still can�t access warzone outbreak. It keeps telling me to download it, but when I do it says I already have it and to check my game library."
Same this is starting to REALLY piss me off
Still taking me to a blank purchase page.  The fuq man.
"Figured it out, have to boot up Cold War then go to Zombies. Thats where you will find the mode."
That's a different Zombies / Outbreak mode. There's one in Cold War & another one in Warzone. The one in Cold War I can access without any problems as well but not the Outbreak mode in Warzone.
Same
One man army. Nice
what attachments do you have on that m4? that was a dope clip bro
"It�s a mono suppressor, tac laser, corp combat hill sight, merc fore grip and 50 round mags"
Nice job
What's the loadout on that absolute beam of an m4?
"Not OP but I�m pretty sure it�s Tac Laser, 50 Round Mag, Corp combat holo sight, monolithic suppressor and the Merc fore grip"
It was a problem the past couple days even with my own.
Radar could have been bugged but couldn�t you just step outside and inspect? PR follows you everywhere.
Or enemy team all equipped with ghost?
He should still hear it whirring about above his head. Ive noticed my own earned personal radar sometimes just never shows up.
yea that might be it

I was 185 and it reset me to 1. Awesome right?

Yeah happened to me but I don't even care anymore I still have all my stuff. Didn't notice anything wrong
BOCW and Modern Warfare/Warzone's levels get reset every season. You still keep all of your unlocks though.
Platinum is for the whole Snipers AND marksman so unless you have all of them gold you won't have platinum; once you get that AX-50 it should be done :)
Ok thanks I was wondering why it wouldn't unlock it good thing I only need 25 kills with no attachments

The MW dlc guns are already in WZ as floor loot?

ditto ^
"How?

Floor Loot
Some of us already got to see it in search lobbies vs cheaters whove been using this and the ice as val since like a month and half ago.
"Yeah, I�ve been wondering how people got, are they hacking it?"
"Anyone able to still unlock it? I get that its not public yet, But people were able to unlock it a while back and im trying to do the same so i can test it out, done the longshots and still unable to use it in survival"
Weapons drop field upgrade and survival only once done long shots
then the bundle will realised?
Probably this season don�t think it�ll be announced just a surprise drop like the rest of the new MW bundles sadly
"Mine had to be moved to my external hard drive to fit the update on there (2hrs) I log on, no new guns but they�re still in survival mode. Then my game starts crashing and saying I have to delete and redownload the application because it�s corrupted (+75hrs)"
"Ooft. I just reinstalled it and Co-Op says the installation is suspended, but I checked and every data pack has been installed. Will I need to uninstall and reinstall it again?"
"Dunno, weird stuff happened to mine where we had to download 17 gb last night for an update and now we have another download for 80gb And I dont know what it's for"
I found mine in library
This happens to me for once a while.
8 days? I have been waiting now 2 months so you can relax there. They dont give a fuck.
"There's no reason for it to take that long though.   


Also did you submit a ticket under your countries flag on their site?"
"Hi Ladies & Gents, so I got my account back and here's how!  


Go to the American chat which is 11am - 4pm (9PM - 2AM GMT). (Do this by clicking the FLAG on the TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER after you've logged in.  


3 things you need;   


1) Be logged in on the account that you need to have fixed.  
2) Have your Activision ID ready.   
3) Have whatever account you want unlinked ready (E.G Gamer-tag, for [battle.net](https://battle.net) you want your gamer-tag and ""GamerTag#0000"".    


Instructions;   


Go to: [https://support.activision.com/](https://support.activision.com/)   


\- Click WARZONE   


\- Choose your Platform.   


\- Choose ""Activision Account""   


\- Choose ""I can't Unlink/Link Accounts.""   


It will then recommend you to click on ""Warzone In Game Registration"". IGNORE THAT COMPLETELY and click on ""More Suggestions""   


\- Scroll to the bottom   


and you will see ""Chat with an Activision Agent."" (Bottom Left)  


For some reason it's greyed out, just press F5 and wait for it to turn yellow before refreshing and keep doing it until it turns yellow and STAYS yellow for more than 5 seconds, DON'T IMMEDIATELY CLICK IT IF IT'S YELLOW, WAIT.   


Join the queue and get ready to give them your details and tell them what you want done. Again ""ACTIVISION NAME#ID and PLATFORM GAMERTAG""

The process took 1hour & 30minutes for both of the accounts I needed to unlink (Purely because of Queue times) the actual chat lasted around 3-7 minutes maximum and in total lasted 3 hours.   


But it was worth it!   


I finally have my account back and I am over the moon about it."
"I've clicked on the chat with activision agent thing and I just get a ""loading agent chat..."" window that doesn't do anything, did the same thing happen to you?"
I�m trying to unlink my account but they support asks me the reason? Did you give them a reason/did they ask you at all?
"Things I've tried so far:   


Submitting tickets on both accounts, one is not receiving any emails from Activision or Call of Duty.  No Reply.   


Submitting a ticket to Blizzard got me my account back as the hacker didn't change the password to his new Email Address. I also asked Blizzard directly to just give me the password to the account, next I'll just try and ask them to delete the account instead as they indeed flagged it as my account (Which is how I got the email address to the account in the first place.)  


[Mailfa.org](https://Mailfa.org) doesn't let me log in to access the email so I can't access the [battle.net](https://battle.net) account to secure my account or even use it. Also being a UK Resident I don't have an ""Iranian/Persian"" email account at all."
"I had the same issue. Probably because you can�t access the games network without updating, so you couldn�t connect to uninstall it (which doesn�t make sense to me) I ended up transferring other games to my external drive to install the update"
damn i delete my rainbow six . anyway thanks
People that use tanks in Ground War are the epitome of skill less. Go cap a flag on foot.
Well we are capping flags the problem is nobody is capping them back. I thought it was a one off thing but it's been going on all day.
Hopefully never. I hate tanks in ground war. Glad they�re removed
"Ground war is nice on some maps but most of them are just bad esp when no one try�s to play the objective.
Karst River Quarry, Krovnik Farmland, Zhokov Boneyard are good Maps.
Barakett Promenade and Tavorsk District are the worst in my opinion all left are atleast playable.
If they had given more love to the Map designs and adjusted warzone maps instead to just to copy paste...
Bf1 operations is def. the most epic I have ever played. Even tho I played it only on ps4 pro.
Bf4 was nice but it�s to old for me now.
Bf5 sucks.
If it�s true that next battlefield gets 64vs64 and the game is polished like bf1 it will probably be #1
I hope I can enjoy bf1 on ps5 soon."
i hope i dont get flamed toohard  for this but if you want a better ground war..  BF4 or even bf1
"You won�t, we all know games has been trying to copy BF conquest formulas for years. And we all know BF4 Conquest is superior to this bullshit. Called Ground War but people are on rooftops and in tanks. Fucking ironic. Might as just call it CamperWar: Small Dicks Conpensating with Big Tanks."
"It's one of the ground loot. I think it'll be officially released soon, maybe after the zombie event"
You can get all three of the unreleased guns from the weapon box field upgrade
"my friend found the cx-9 in plunder, specifically the blueprint in soap�s bundle"
"We do know, its ground loot"
Is that a rangefinder on the scope? Looks cool
You telling me a LMG that has insane horizontal curved recoil in mw survival somehow has 0 recoil in plunder?  These cheaters are everywhere it seems.
Nah nah he was controlling that thing and I can tell
"Gun Butting does more damage than fists, just a reminder."
Knockout!

"like the other guy said, I'm pretty sure rebirth island gives more blueprints, and 5 kills is basically nothing. It might take a while tho"
Plunder maybe is an option... you can use your own classes and it�s fairly easy to kill people even the people you kill during the warm up will most likely count.
"Plunder AFK drop with a JOKR in your loadout, hope for a quiet landing and melee AFK players with the JOKR.  I made sure to get the down and the kill just to secure it *but* I know some challenges are a bit fucky about what constitutes a kill when it comes to Warzone so getting both just gives a little peace of mind!"
"Best bet is to go on Rebirth Island, find a gun and camp"
I might be wrong but I think I read you have to find a legendary weapon in the game. The blueprints you already have don't count?
"It took me so insanely long to get this skin that I basically refuse to run anything else, both in MW2 and Warzone."
wait you tellin me i can get gaz for free by getting 5 kills with a legendary blueprint on warzone? only warzone?
no unfortunately... it's in a purchased bundle
"Yeah, imagine it like before battle passes were a thing, each cod got 4 dlcs, now imagine that the 4 dlcs are over for mw and they moved on to cold war. The only reason the battle pass is still on mw is for shared progression and to convince people to buy coldwar"
Funny thing is I bought Cold War played it hated it then played a few matches today and still prefer modern warfare hands down 100% then Cold War the  movement and the gameplay is just so much better in my opinion
"So basically they are done with MW at this point.. well, it just sucks i guess."
"CW is in the spotlight right now, because it just came out, but there are rumours that a season 7 will come to MW"
I really hope so. Because after seeing two seasons in a row with only having warzone and cw content is just gets boring tbh. :P
"I doubt there will be any new content for MW, multiplayer specifically. For the most part, when a new cod comes out they drop the previous one from their focus. It�s still an active game. 

Imo: we should be boycotting the battle pass because cod devs and Activision have constantly said F the community and are just money hungry."
I just unlocked a sticker from the battlepass. Think it was at tier 2 or something and it unlocked for mw guns too so not everything is excluded.
They are not making any more content for modern warfare at the moment the only items they have in the battle pass are for black ops and warzone specific
"So, MW is pretty much dead at this point?"
"Shame, I finally saved up enough COD Points to purchase a battle pass and now I have to buy a new game to make it worthwhile..."
Exactly
"What make you think they care about you and MW? Not to be rude here but you are entitled to your own opinion, always. 

Look, they are done with MW, play the game as it is right now if you feel like it or you don�t if you feel like you aren�t getting enough out of the 60 bucks and those Battlepasses you paid for. Let get it straight, lets say someone paid you 60 bucks for the first month and some sprinkling of cash along the way, but then asked you to work for them years down the line out of what? Just kindness? Yo people need to make a living. You are literally asking IW to do the same, asking for stuffs without paying them. Remember back in the day maps and guns came in DLCs and you had to pay? That is how you get content, you pay, not demand.

They don�t owe you anything, anymore, the only left is the guns and Soap, which would be added sometimes later as I have read. If you don�t play Warzone, which is fine, but if you didn�t buy any from the store, didn�t buy CW. You really have no rights to demand them for stuffs. You aren�t paying them more cash and they wouldn�t do it even with your cash handled to them, because fixing old stuffs isn�t as profitable as making new stuffs. And quite frankly they don�t care if they hurts your feelings or not. This is Activision, this is their way, either live with it, or don�t. Play something else, stop hurting yourself by being disappointed about things that happen annually."
"The battle pass is right there, in modern warfare. The rewards are there also, only with Warzone and Cold War logos.

They only have to allow players to use the rewards in Modern Warfare, its that simple.

I recently bought Modern Warfare and the battle pass of season one, so I don't know what you're talking about with your ""they don't owe you nothing"", and ""you really have no rights to demand them for stuffs"".

Your comment makes little sense, but the same can be said to Activision, that keeps a battle pass in a game with rewards for another game.

I paid the company money, so I have every right to demand stuff, especially since the stuff is right there in the battle pass, in Modern Warfare, only to be used in Warzone and Cold War. 

So I pay for the game, I pay for the Battle pass, but the rewards in game are for the free version of the game or the other one I have to buy (again) for a decent amount of money."
"Well, first off all no worries, i didn't got offended or anything by your command and yes, you're right at most of the points. 

The thing is that its a bad reputation if they won't release new stuff for their game that came out in 2019. Which I consider as a new game. (And come on, who wouldn't?). And asking for a new content is fine, that's what everyone should've doing honestly. There's nothing wrong with that. Not because i've not bought anything, i did bought CP to complete my Battlepass. But even if i didn't gave them my money and just got the Base game + Warzone, i still have right to want stuff from them. Its the same thing what people wanting to do to Fortnite, CS:GO, Apex Legends, Overwatch or League of Legends.  It's what makes them stay alive still. Specially for the CS:GO, that's why the game is still alive and still going strong even if they have many cheaters in the game. And they are getting a lot of profit from those games. And i do remember people did demand for the dlc packs. (Because which is.. that's how they came to the store at the first place.)"
There�s no CW store bundles in MW mp only in Warzone.
"Nah, just got scammed $10 cause I bought a CDL pack in MUltiplayer store when it�s only usable in CW, not even in warzone despite it stating that"
"They integrated CW and MW to make it simpler leveling for Warzone. There are many benefits if you play both games and if you don�t, then just ignore the battle pass and store as most items will be for CW since that is the newest game. Does it really bother you that much a company is promoting their newest game?"
"The annoying fucking thing is.. i just got on to play modern warfare and i ONLY play modern warfare yet i have to fucking install a 20 gb update for WARZONE cause fucking black ops shit war got a season 2. Why in fuck's name can i not remove WARZONE? Why do i have to have black ops updates on my game when i only paid for modern warfare and only wish to play that game only. At least make it optional to update warzone as some of you might say oh you need warzone because it shares assets with MW, okay cool. But why do i need to have black ops weapons, skins and that games assets when i never play it?"
"Imagine buying a car just to find that the radio won�t turn off and is constantly blasting advertisement for another vehicle, and the manual for your car is actually not compatible was written for their newest model"
"Uh yeah absolutely lol, this is pure bullshit. They are forcing it down your throat when you paid $60 for the OTHER GAME. Now they take over it�s platform and ruin Warzone with Cold War which is a terrible game."
"I think at this point we all concluded that activision's executives are fucking brain dead. I don't think they even comprehend the concept of what you are laying down.

Instead of providing updates and added material to their previous game and have people still buying their overpriced cosmetics(cause let's be honest they still make a fortune out of those), they would rather make a whole new game which requires a lot more effort. But instead of doing it right they botch it and then complain no one is buying it. Let's be clear. If the manhours invested in CW were instead placed on MW we would have new guns new maps and new events and new battlepasses THAT PEOPLE PAY FOR. 

So in the end they would probably have more profit and a less upset comunity. Cause right now not only are they showing to CW fans that they really don't care about quality, they are also harassing the people that want to stick to modern warfare. I don't know about you but after this last update i'm about ready to dig a hole for the whole CoD franchise."
"I don�t think they are brain-dead. Remember, it�s all about their bottom-line. If anything they are fucking geniuses whose job is to fuck with their customers while grabing all the cash. They fucked us over, brain-dead people can�t do that are all busy lobbying their ways to the nearest GameStop to be the first to have the new CoD...EVERY-fucking-YEAR."
Srry to say but investors wouldn�t go for that.
You do realize they have to get to work on sequels right? We had a full year of content that was more than any other cod game. The entitlement here is astounding.
"You ought to read before you comment, man."
"If you�re playing core, then you shouldn�t let go of that trigger"
Damn bro you didn�t have to waste it like that
Lol reminds me of when I got a Jugg on shipment. Died in like 20 seconds because people just spawned behind me and hit me with the doof doof
"If you can get back to it, you can pick it up off the ground again."
MW2019 was cannibalized so they could sell their shitty blops... That said I am enjoying all the zombies content.
that's just a typical COD spawn...
"I play shipment... so, no."
"Nah, I've respawned like 8 times in the same spot off a spawn trap. This is nothing."
"I feel ya, they just aint have to do me like this for the final kill though!"
I think the defeat screen was icing on the cake
No one told you about respawn in call of duty ? :DDD
"Don�t worry, I remember about half a year ago somebody died to the same sipper bullet twice.. the guy got collated"
"Get three kills, either triple or not. That�s how i read it.

It would say triple kill if that�s what it meant."
"Read the title again and you will see what Issue I have.I made 4 kills with my cruise missle (that is a killstreak). I made a double and two single kills. On rust I made another 5 kills with it, still not unlocked

>It would say triple kill if that�s what it meant.

I thought that too, but apperently its not :/

Edit: I think I found the issue. Ithink its only possible to finish this challenge by doing it in Warzone or Cold Ware Multiplayer, because its a Black Ops operator."
Yeah I see the issue. Your rpg looks like the kilo
Have u tried unlinking then relinking the account?

"Oh wow, did it fix or no?"
"Lol, noob"
Try restarting the App?
Lmao do people actually fall for this
"It won't hurt to put 2fa. Also change the email associated with your activison account and change the password to it. Make a new email that you dont use for anything else, and make the password something completley different than you use for anything else. Be sure to use upper and lower case letters, and numbers and symbols

That might be a bit overkill, but better safe than sorry. I did it when all this hacking stuff started last year, and ive changed my password a few times"
"Thank you, I'll do that!"
I've just done it and it's worth noting that I couldn't get it to work using Firefox but it worked first time with Chrome. Scanned the QR code.
Putting on 2FA would help a lot
Dumb question but what is 2FA?
"Get 2FA and you're fine. If you want, unlink and link your account again on all platforms will make your account unusable by anyone else."
Does 2FA work for ps5?
Just don�t play MW anymore. Ez
I think its just a worse ak47. And the ak47 is just a worse amax. Ak47 is still my favorite gun though
5.45 > 7.62 ak imo
"I only play HC, so everything really comes to accuracy and landing that first shot. And I feel like the SCAR-H is a really good contender in that because it hits like a truck, it really rare I will get a hitmaker. This gun really depends on accuracy and not rate of fire and just spray and prey. I fell in love with this gun in MW2, and it never really let me down. The only downside I really see with it, is it's small ammo capacity and reserve. You really can't go on high kill steaks without scavenger. Everyone use to using guns like there SMG's but you can't really do that with this one, it's made more for mid-to-long range fire."
"I don't like it in hardcore, because it has such a horrible movement and ads speed. Even with full ads attachments its just so sluggish compared to other one shot guns"
Because it has a garbage fire rate and even with its high damage it's not enough to cover for it.
It weighs you down too much for how poorly it compares performance wise to weapons like the M4. It feels like you�re lugging around an ODEN but doesn�t kill like it
"Simply it doesn't have good TTK accounting for ads and sprint out.  It doesn't have ads move speed stock that still give you consistent shots while you strafe checking different angles like skeleton stocks on other weapons.  It's already got slow move speed and a barrel and mag further slows it down.  Finally it doesn't shoot where the reticle is, IW""s way of balancing high cal rifles of giving it reticle shake and misaligned bullet trajectory."
"In hardcore it hits well, but really depends on accuracy and first shot, but I�ve noticed in it appears to miss on kill cams when it shows hitting on my screen (final kill cam, play of the game, or core mode).

I�d say you�re right though, something feels a little off with it, especially over longer distances."
Ran the scar yesterday in hc search with no attachments and it wrecked
"No stock is what the gun needs to do well

Run no stock, tac laser, tac Foregrip, long barrel, stippled grip. It's very good when you get used to it. Hit the chest and head and you'll kill in 2-3 shots"
"Because is not a recoilless gun like Amax, it takes time to learn its recoil pattern, i would recomend this: Compesator, 17.0 Barrel, Commando Foregrip, 25 Round mags, Collapsible  Stock"
Scar in hardcore search is great.

See i wouldn't have a problem with yearly release if they focused on 2 franchise. Black ops is very different from modern warfare and the two player populations are very different as well. Why can't we have CW and MW running at the same time while still receiving updates? I prsonnally don't like the setting of cold war. I am not interested in zombies and i am not interested in the 80's. I am sure the black ops comunity dosen't care about modern warfare either. So why push people to buy games that they don't want? Just keep support running for two games and when they release an other modern warfare i'll be whilling to buy it(depending on quality of course). But cold war no thanks
Exactly
"I would love cold war if it used the IW engine. The Treyarch engine feels so fuckin clunky. The movement feels unwieldy. With the IW engine the movement feels like youre sliding and parkouring around  effortlessly with snappy, responsive movement. Cold War is such a sad face for me."
"The ups and downs are part of game production. At least MW and CW are significantly different each year. Looks at the backlash EA has received for launching a sports game every year that is nearly a carbon copy from the previous years.

Even of your favorite musician put out an album every year, you wouldn�t like all of them. And you don�t have to be a customer if you don�t want."
Yeah I get what you are saying but I wish they would stop starving the previous games of content
I wish Kesha had put out carbon copy music every year for the last 10 years :(
I can't afford their skins or battle passes if they keep making me spend half a hundred dollars on an installment
I hope you realize you�re talking to a brick wall (activision)
Not entirely activisons fault because they want them to stop updating MW so people buy cold war
"I totally agree with you. Although cw is not bad,i think mw is waaay better and i'm just disappointed about them dropping...."
Yeah I agree with you there
"I've heard people complain about the yearly release schedule more this time than any year before tbh. I think it's mostly because Cold War feels like a previous gen game compared to MW so people feel like Activision is sacrificing a good title for something that feels old and dated.

The problem isn't the schedule, even though I've never been a fan of it. The problem is that most of us when we boot up CW feel like we're playing a game from 2015. Which we are, since it's 2015 graphics with 2015 gameplay.

Acti completely underestimated, or just flatout doesn't care, how dated the Black Ops engine is compared to the IW engine."
The sooner everyone realises that yearly release create the most revenues for companies the better
If they didn't have yearly relea$e$ they wouldn't make anywhere near the amount of dollar$ than if they did. They've shown time and time again that they do not give a rats ass about the end consumer as long as the dollhairs are flowing in.
 This year will another COD come out? I've heard it will be MW2. It's true?
It�s gonna be a ww2 game made by sledgehammer

"It's a shame and it's only going to get worse. I'm just glad that IW is getting 3 years of dev time for MW2, almost as if Acti takes them as the most important studio out of the big three."
"What is a ""head cam killcam""?

I keep seeing people mention it but I have no clue what it means."
It was a system early in the game that would make killcams look like they were taken by a camera on the side of your helmet. It looked really cool and they even show it in one of the original trailers for a split second.
Imo I think a new cod every 2 or 3 years
Vote with your wallet.
"Something tells me that this year will be the year they stop with the yearly releases and decide to stick with BOCW for all of 2021.

""Not enough of y'all bought BOCW, so we're not releasing a new game until the sales match MW2019."""
They are never gonna stop yearly releases
Cold War was the highest selling cod in history for release date and is apparently a top 20 all time game for sales in the US. I doubt that�s the issue and I can�t see them ever stopping yearly releases unless people stop buying the games which clearly isn�t happening.
"Considering how many microtransactions the game has, I don't think they need time."
You guys this is capitalist America I don�t know why we need a post about this every day. They need to produce a new thing to make a new purchase to keep the wheels turning that is how our society works this should not be shocking
Are you high
"Can't you still see all of the available blueprints through a menu in the gunsmith? Regardless of if they show on the store or not?

I know I grabbed a few that way at one point."
No it was there yesterday it isn�t anymore
WHY DO THEY DO THIS
[deleted]
I have enough cp so just gonna wait cause it also has the bests attachments
"Maybe different region, but in NA in wz and mp it's in the armory for both."
Not there for me maybe I will reload the game see but that is really annoying
Did this just happen for you with the update? It's a bug that has come up with every new major version release for me. It eventually goes away after a few minor patches.
This has been happening since season one update and thought it would have been fixed with new update. :/
"Well you�re not alone in this. Same thing happens to me but tbh, it doesn�t really take any time for it to finish. Like maybe a minute! I know it might be annoying but I just boot up the game and check my phone for a bit till everything is ready to go."
"I can't get on until the update finishes, but I do know that in Borderlands 3 this same thing happens if you have DX12 on (switching back to DX11 solves it there)."
"I mean even if you did like it would probably only install like 50 mb from
The disc and the rest digitally anyway"
What's the point of the 69 gig update? They're gonna change like 2 pixels and maybe add a gun.
To save like 10 gigs? Lol thats what it feels like anytime I get a game on disc to save space. Not worth it to me
"I have 3 two terabyte external storage, I don't have to worry much about space."
Maybe you should look into some better internet.
This gives me Big Scare
What was the update even for? Nothing has been changed in modern warfare since November
69 gig update to change like a texture and maybe add a gun.
Closing any apps will help speed this up.  Also probably better to download them one at a time.
93gb? It's only 20gb or so on PC.
[deleted]
"._. you aren't very smart huh? When you buy a disc on any console, instead of it having to digitally download the game, it just copies the game straight off the disc, almost an instantaneous download"
"Damn, on Xbox it's only 17gb"
"I was rather unimpressed when I decided to go with discs on my PS5 (100% disc less on Xbox) and found installing off discs weren�t any faster but I also am downloading those size files way faster......and you still get stuck with finishing the disc install on some games only to find out when you go to play it that there is an update it needs to install.

Overall the only difference I feel with going to discs is I have to store them, move them in and out of the system and that�s about it."
I mean you bought it at the end of it'scycle.
It's the first cod game i bought ever. How am I supposed to know that activision is just letting it die while still selling it full launch price?
"Same here, but the problem is that even if you own CODBOCW the ads stay in place. Can't buy it twice thou..."
"Right? It's fucking insane. And don't worry, i'm sur activision will come up with a way of making you buy the game twice. Only a matter of time."
"Bro it�s far from dead, ignore the CW propaganda and enjoy the game like 90% of other cod players are. CW is dog shit, MW still has a very active player base."
God damn you buy your first cod game and expect to go in and play mw at the end of its life cycle and complain on reddit cause when you buy it and have to download all the updates because you didnt buy it when it came out and now complain that it has cold war ?? So late ? Sounds like complaining for attention while your a year late ... didn't you see the download size and the information when you bought it ? Comments sense.
"Ho wait did i miss the part where i was forced to download data for a game i did not purchased? Yeah cause fucking no one else does that! Suck a dick fuckface i'm not here for the attention i'll take all them downvotes you got for me. This lifecycle bullshit is an aberation to the videogame industry and does not exist apart from CoD and EA sports. It should not be expected that a 1 year old game is loosing support for any reason other than the studio going bancrupt. And it should also not be expected to download a game you didn't ask for. Have you seen blizzard pushing a diablo 3 update when you download overwatch? Ho yeah no. They don't do that cause they aren't fuck dumb.

I bough MW not this stupid ass warzone and even less CW."

On console when I was playing on my friends console, I sucked in general gameplay but when we did trickshotting I actually could somewhat keep up lmao. On PC 360 is pure coinflip for me at least noscope. (at least in this game where you didnt got steady aim perk and spread decreasing weapon perk as in MW3)"

"It�s for Cold War, you got to download the free trial for it, try just going directly through the store there should be a trial listed"
"When I go to the store and then at COD black ops Cold War, it says you can�t play COD black ops Cold War, and there is there is the Play button but I can�t push it. The only other things I can do on the page is: buy, patchnote or upgrade(buy)"
I feel like this is gonna go under the radar and not enough people will notice for it to even be a big deal
Yeah it�s gone. I�m on PC and noticed it missing a couple weeks ago. Definitely intentional.
I could totally also post screencaps of a few after action reports without a commendation page if someone wants to see
"Yes, I can't find it anymore after match."
"Same problem here.
Can't find no answers and very few complaints."
Same
Check the after action report log thing ? It should show all commendations

"Try logging in, when it tells you can�t connect select offline. Then from that screen hit the button to go online. This will give you another error and take you back to the home screen, but if you click it again it should work.

It�s confusing but it always works for me."
Not working for me.
They had 3 Russian mil sim skins in the season 4 battle pass
Didnt really like that the fgf guy didn't have a bullet proof vest. I dont think those were the best skins. Is there any that are better
This isn't new but it's still cool. Bale's [Protectorate](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryPorn/comments/gq42ui/mw_operator_bale_protectorate_skin_and_real_life/) skin is cool and modern. It was also copied from a picture of an actual Russian special forces operator.
"Lots of it were on the pass but no milsims were intriguing. I find FSB milsim bundle had the best one. Look for it in the armory under the rifle ""Temhota"" i believe and youll find the bundle."
The individuals that work there with integrity may see these posts but they'll just shake their head in disgust because they can't speak out of term.
Man i'd rather work at McDonalds than to work in these conditions. Filling activision's pockets while they can't even make the game better is an insult to the devs. How do you live with your entire work getting sabotaged by the very company you work for?
They probably look but the amount of posts with no actual feedback blocks out the posts with feedback.
"Devs will occasionally scroll through here, but they avoid talking on posts outside of interesting clips or fan made content. I don�t blame them."
Infinity ward stopped going on this subreddit before cold war was even announced. Cold war and warzone is the focus right now and mw2 is being made.
"Mw2 is being made? thats just a little rumor that no one knows if its true or not. Whats more likely is sledgehammer is releasing their game, which is rumored to be another ww2 game"
Probably but they can't do anything without the permission of the council.
"Im not 100% sure but i think u should link ""Xbox"" to ""BattleNet"", not the vice versa. Cuz the Old one (Higher Level) should host the new account ""Xbox""."
No. You link your battlenet to your activision account (which will be done since you used to play on PC) then your xbox account to the same activision account. Aslong as both are on your Activision account you're good to go.
"Obligatory ""change your minimap to square, you can see a little bit more"""
that�s possible?
Every kill with the AX-50 is satisfying
Well but actually it�s Not-Syria in this game.
I love these types of things and the attention to detail in MW. It made the game feel so much more grounded
"Thats interesting, nice find"
That looks beautiful ngl
Did you buy the digital deluxe? Because I went that route and got Woods plus the M4 variant
yep bought it from battle net
and i didn't installed it yet
"I think anyone who is expecting them to put modern warfare stuff in the battle pass is hoping for something impossible. The battle pass is free advertising and showing you what you could have if you bought the new game.

Don�t expect them to add anything to mw, because chances are it ain�t gonna happen, they want to divert sales to Cold War, pretty much any content coming out is gonna be for Cold War and warzone, not mw, the last thing they want is to encourage you to keep playing the game you own, they want to encourage you to buy the new game not play what you got."
"Exactly but i am disgusted anyway, they don�t change the season challenges!!"
I think they�re releasing a MW season 7 at the 1 year anniversary of warzone that will have multiplayer stuff in it.
What makes you think that
"Doubtful, they wouldn't release a entire mw season. We may see some mw/wz blueprints/operator skins get mixed in with the cw/wz stuff, but the battle pass will never be 100% mw ever again."
Well warzone was updated which is part of mw so that was part of it.
"The fact that warzone is part of MW never made sense. Even more now that the updates don't have anything to do with MW. That's part of the comments i'd like to put out there. If they want to stop supporting MW maybe they could let us have an app that dosen't include 100GB of unrelated shit. The reason WZ is updated is because there is new stuff in CW. So i'm getting a cold war update on MW. Wtf

Also that means if you do have cold war and war zone your get the update twice. Who the fuck thought about that? How about integrate warzone to cold war instead?"
The fact that you said both are the same game blew my mind. It�s like I�m being fed crayons and lost all of my brain cell. Holy shit you are thick.
"Ive seen devs on here before, but before cold war came out. Theres a few devs that are really active on the cold war sub

Im sure they look at this sub, but cant do or say anything with activison breathing down their neck"
This is plain sad. Draging the devs names in crap to sell their new game. If I was one of them I would fuck off at this point. How do you live with your entire work sabotaged by your own studio?
Try 'scan and repair'
"I just restarted my PC and it went back to normal. Idk why it started being underused after a while but a restart just fixed it I guess and made it run like usual. 
Weird."
HAHAHAHA This is some bullshit... Can't even have my own thoughts now? Good joke
Were they the missions added by mistake that are gone?
"No. Nothing added by mistake to my game
Base game operator missions are missing
I didn't complete any of them (i bought the game last season)"
"Same here, after the update a few days ago all the operator missions are gone. The cold war operators don't have this problem though... of course..."
"So im not the only one?
Is it going to fixed anytime soon?"
"I have the exact same problem currently (Dday, Domino, Wyatt). they weren't tracking any progress before the recent patch and now they're completely gone... wanted to ask for an answer in the Activision live chat but was #150 in line with a waiting time of about 90min..."
This game is a broken mess
"Alright? Everybody knew that there wouldn't be another season for modern warfare, why did you expect anything different?"
"Because there's people that don't really play Warzone,  bought MW for the multiplayer, and is REALLY annoying to only get stuff for the next game they want me to buy. Dirty tactics"
I thought the update changed it back? It was all blue again when I first loaded up the game after updating
"Not on my end. Still got the CW style until I go local. Could be platform-specific for whatever reason, what do you play on?"
It did the same for me
Thanks!
Wouldn�t it be a smack in the Face if they just made them a Cold War/ warzone weapons and not mw.
"Skorpion EVO started to go in service in 2009, so that would make absolutely no sense. RAAL (I don't know which gun in real life) also seems to be a recent gun."
"They're already there in survival, it would be dumb and not to mention time-consuming transferring those guns over to cold war instead of making it in the cold war platform in the first place"
"They seriously not release them with the season? What are they, trying to kill there game for cold war? Make the battle pass for all 3 games, lots of people arent gonna buy cold war, and now they are trying to get people to stop playing modern warfare. Start up season 7, and keep both games alive and they will make even more money."
If infinity ward continued to make seasons they would not have time to work on the sequel. They need to stop at some point and work on their new game.
I sure hope so. They definitely have two more MW operators with store bundles in the game files.
An SPR Blueprint in the same bundle as the Sykov is also ground loot so it confirms that its coming too.
They're \*rumored\* to launching sometime in early March.
What's the RAAL blueprint?
"I think it's called the Rook? It's notable because the optic has a range finder on it which tells you distance up to 200m

Both the floor loot blueprints are orange (5 attachments)"
so were the rumors true?
"Well there's still a month or so left...

I'm optimistic but also realistically who knows"
Will these be able to be used to Cold War multiplayer? Or just useable in Modern warfare? Will it be useable in only warzone? Or also modern snorefare mp?
"When they're added it'll be MW MP and WZ, not CW"
"the 3 weapons are now fully implimented into warzone (so soon probably MW too, most likely that rumored 11 march update) and you can get them as ground drops, they also are fully working in codtracker now."
"I unlocked them and they aren't showing up for me anywhere.

Are they only in ground loot?"
I never touched Warzone since it came out. I wish it was a separate download because I technically have large files of a game installed on my computer that I don't even play. Waste of storage and waste of time (updates).
"I have 28 gb left in my ps4 due to that update, and i haven't downloaded all the mw content..."
The issue of it being separate would be having two basically have mw downloaded twice for warzone. The file size wouldn�t be much smaller with just multiplayer
And one thing to point out that the legendary blueprint for the cx9/ scorpion gives it no recoil at all like it�s non existent
"Havent played that garbage for months. It�s a dumbass integration of two games which is filled with meta abusing rozelords, unbalanced weapons and toxic kids. They completely ruined a perfect first person shooter."
Sorry but not all weapons can be the same lol
Bro I even hate the font in Cold War that�s how much I hate the game
I also hate the grey button color instead of the digital blue that they used to have
Log in to a random private match then hop out. No thanks needed.

"I don't care about any of these complaints really but the complaining about complaining argument is valid. It's an oxymoron to complain over someone complaining over something small. You're literally doing the same thing, it's just a different topic."
">	�Oh the main menu...� like why does it bother you? It�s a main menu! Just press modern warfare and play it. You guys cry about anything.

Oh my God thank you. So many people literally crying about a main menu, like who cares? You can navigate to MW just fine, can�t you?"
"you are right bro,i bought battlepass season one,all items are for black ops and warzone,i didnt expect like this before i bought this,my points are gone to trash,they should focus on modern warfare,its the realtime modern warfare game ever"
"by the way they release painful huge updates for warzone issues etc,before mw game was single they collect all game in one page"
No u.
the game is gonna be alive for the next 5 years
"Im surprised that people in the comment section don�t realize this is satire,making fun of the people who genuinely make posts like this...."
It�s annoying bro like I just wanna watch gameplay and talk about the game. Dudes complaining every 5 seconds.
"the game is imo the best state its been in yet

On ps4 the frames are fine, servers active, guns fairly balanced other then a select few which have counters, yes there is a fuck ton of advertising but once you ready up to enter a team deathmatch or whatever the game works fine

Other then the menu's this game is perfect"
i mean the people crying about a menu are little bitches but activision is definitely trying to kill of mw in favor of cw. that 25 gb update a few weeks ago did nothing but add bugs and remove shipment. at least this update they kept one of the only fun things about this game
Just keep playing mw
Modern warfare good
Updates bad
"Yeah this game is just a advertisement and it will continue for other games as well


MW3 advertises AW


Ghost does the same 

MW advertises Cold War 

Cold War would advertise the next game 


Iw has left this game for cod 2022

Cold War is the new one 

Sledge hammer is gonna take the next one (cod 2021)"
I don�t know why you�re surprised.  Every year they release a new game and support moves over to it.
"I get that, but what�s the point in keeping the BP if the game it�s on isnt the game it�s for? It�s a shame how it�s turned out because the MW storyline is so good. They could of done a hell of a lot with it and versansk. Imo Cold War is a horrendous game with hardly any potential. The only thing that sells is the zombie element really."
How are you surprised? It was the exact same for season 1????
"Mw is set in the present, piggybacking off of the first mw with boat loads of potential to carry on without losing the realism which makes it so addictive. yet they�re investing heavily in cw instead which is A) nothing like the trailers, B) set in the past C) cw is so corny and cringeworthy that people who have never played warzone/mw would probably never link the two/three together."
atleast you have something to grind towards if you ever pick up wz or cw
"I suppose that is the positive, just wounded about the fact."
"Yes, it has occurred to them. But it's a business, promoting it's new product."
This aint promotion anymore. What they are doing is obnoxious and frankly nobody will ever want to buy their stupid franchise. Now people are quitting mw because of their integration and stupid promotion policies. How to lose two fanbases with one stone 101.
They advertise the new game on the old game every year. Who gives a shit
"Yep. Loaded up AW last night and the first thing I get is a pop up for WWII. Same in every other game. People act like this is new, but it's been here since the MW2 days."
"It won�t. Boot up MW3 and you�ll see a (albeit much smaller) Ad for Advanced Warfare. It�s always happened, always will."
How about you grow some balls and learn to overcome the ads by ya know...fucking turn it off and play the game? Do you whine like a self-rightious kid everytime an ads popped up on youtube while you are watching? It�s literally just a fucking ads.
How dare they promote one of the games in the other.. seriously get real it doesn�t change the game at all.
"It's not dlss, its what consoles use, the game will reduce your resolution if you drop below the targeted framerate"
"You can check for blueprints through the armory. Go to the weapon you know has a blueprint in the bundle, like the x16. Since you haven't bought it yet, it should be in the bottom of the list somewhere. If it's not there, chances are it's been removed from the store"
"Why would they remove it from the store? Cause I don�t see it. 

Has this happened previously and coming back?"
"Exactly my thought, check the armory."
"Honestly I'm just waiting for the next MW

Cold War is one of those games where if I didn't have MW the MP would be a fun time waste in between other stuff. That's basically exactly how I viewed all other BO MPs and still played them a decent amount. But MW exists. No joke I can't even play a full cold war game without getting bored and booting up MW. Why play cold war when MW is better in every single possible way?

I haven't actually played a Sledgehammer COD before so I have no idea what to expect. I'll probably just stick with MW."
">No joke I can't even play a full cold war game without getting bored and booting up MW

We're all living the same life."
"I have Cold War. It's like an absolute piece of trash and a total downgrade from 2019's MW. You can't lean, mount weapons or cancel reload. That's to name some really basic things you can do in MW.

They are using MW now to advertise the piece of trash that CW is and they have to do it because nobody wants to play it.

I mean, when you open MW (Multiplayer) now you see a lot of notifications of Cold War notifications that you can only use in the cancerous Warzone or Cold War. Why the fck would I want to see weapon notifications for a different game in MW?

As per CW: I do not like it. I don't like the setting, the gunplay, the animations, the sounds, the weapons. It is extremely bad and runs awfully in my RTX2070 SUPER.

MW2021: This time around will probably be Advanced Warfare or futuristic setting. Either that or they expand 2019's MW. There's some rumors about it."
"I completely agree with you with CW. They're pushing it way too hard on our faces, like even the battlepass on MW is about CW like come on man what is this. Let MW be MW. Another big factor that adds realism in MW vs CW are camera tilts and camera shake, it plays a huge role on how the gameplay feels.

Do futuristic CODs usually do well?"
"Well, the devs feel out of inspiration. They even copied Battleflield 4's idea from Paracel Storm Levolution and implemented in the new update a crashed ship to the shore >.> .
Idk what they're doing, but lately, as a gamer, I felt like I was given lack of respect. The content is poor, the maps are poor, the guns always have problems and God, cheating...don't wanna start this topic...
Keep their pockets fat guys! That's the moment they'll lose their respect for us!
#WaitingforBF6"
"The devs that listen to the community and highly prioritise customers will forever be the best ones out there to make the best games as well as big racks for themselves.

I strongly believe MW had another year of lifespan and delay cold war till this year so that they could work on it even more and release a finished game."
I heard that this ww2 is set in the pacific so that might spice things up. I agree it is still ww2 but at least it is somewhat different right?
"They definitely have to spice things up this time because they know they'll not make much profit by keeping similar storylines and ""remastering"" the old ones."
I heard it was Korean War ? That or a alternate reality ww2 where the war never ended
Looks better than before. I hope they will release it.
Why would he have a big watermark on him? Maybe the special forces are working on a new flash marketing method but what is the tactical advantage of a watermark in battle?
"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER AND INSTA, AND DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE, HIT THE BELL, LIKE THE VIDEO AND DROP A COMMENT"
Because someone can steal it without crediting (like Charlie Intel already did once)
Looks like a Great Value Ryan Gosling
Real human being
Same detail that I like more but I think he just looks better with blue eyes instead of shit brown ones.
"Jesus that watermark is just obnoxious. One is fine I guess, but it it really gets in the way of the model."
"Wish they did this to roze unmasked, she looks like that one triangle Titan for AoT..."
"Face is kind of the same, but a little longer."
"Face is kind of the same, but a little longer."
Lose the beanie and goggles � they're covering up his magnificent mohawk!
I wish they would have matches where they can�t quick scope. It�s cool you guys can do this but to me it takes the fun out of the game.
Oh man do I have a game for you: Battlefield 1 . I can never get away with this in that game. Play it for a while and I almost guarantee cod will be a walk in the park
"It's clearly a means of advertising. It costs them basically nothing to advertise on the old game's menu.

CoD releases every year. Gets updates for a year, and gets abandoned. Why are you surprised?

I'm not saying I wanted it to be abandoned, I'm just saying that it was inevitable. It was always going to happen, so you shouldn't be surprised when the content is for the new game, and the live service game.

I don't really mind CW that much. It's not amazing by any means, nor do I think it's as good as MW, but it's not terrible. I'm personally glad that I can play MW and still progress in the battlepass for CW too. 

Of course, I still think warzone and modern warfare should be kept separate though, since MW gets shoved under the rug with warzone just slapped all over it."
It�s like people here are surprised that a business is trying to make money.
[deleted]
I didnt play much or buy the battlepass in season 1 I stopped playing around season 3 or 4 when it was actually the game still
"They only care about money, that�s why they releases a new call of duty every year , they know that they have loyal fans so people will buy their games , you hate cold war ?? I do too , i don�t play it , let�s pray that the new cod that is coming will be a game that we like but i doubt it!!!"
"I feel your pain , i only play mw19 , it�s like that , the same thing will happen to cold war at the end of the year, once they released a new game they automatically dropped the old one, the best thing you can do is to play cold war for a week and enjoy the stuff it will be free from today to  march 4th !!!"
"Tea sadly they want this game dead, they want you on Cold War or warzone they do not want you playing this anymore."
"I am still holding out for the new content for mw on March 11 (guns, soap, etc) ... hopefully!!!! Would love to slap with the cz skorpion"
"Why are you and so many others so attacked and hurt by this? 

Activision literally has done this with every Call Of Duty for over a decade.

A Call Of Duty drops,it gets dlc and updates til the next Call Of Duty drops, then the last Call Of Duty gets abandoned and then the cycle continues its always been like this.

Believe me it would be nice if they would support all their games even after the new ones come out but Activision is too greedy,they do this on purpose to make everyone buy a new game every year."
"Future Support should not be expected

Playing the game in its best possible functioning state *is* expected. Nobody can say with a straight face that MW as a title is performing at its best right now. The game was way more stable during Season 3 - 6 era than during its end of life.

I don't know what this Reddit community as a whole expects, but I expect to be able to play the game with the quality that it had during the prime of the pandemic. /endrant."
"I feel the same and I don�t think they�re gonna let mw go that easily. Mw19 is gonna stay a while later thanks to warzone and they know that. They�re still making updates, they�re still adding bundles, etc. They have 3 options for season 3. 1. Keep it the way it is which is the worst option. 2. Add a separate battle pass for each game with makes more work for the devs at infinity ward, but makes them more money from people who have both games and want both bp. 3. a) (My personal favourite) make each tier toggleable like vehicle skins. 3. b) make it toggleable for certain tier or make a few tiers in the bp mw19 items. I think the most likely of the 3 is 2 cuz we all know activision wants their money."
Have they actually added anything to MW in this new update? If I have to download a 17GB update that accommodates CW content I�m gonna be pissed
Theres no mw mp content
**From what I heard it should've been 10GB..?**
Dude i�m more suprised 16.44 out of 28.67 is 14%

What a legend. Everything makes sense now haha. I was worried that now I have to wait hours and hours for this new 28GB update."
"Nope. 

I had the same update on Battlenet."
"I�m dealing with being banned for no reason lmao

Had to buy the game again /:"
"damn you should contact them, i�ve heard their twitter can be helpful"
it happens to me a lot
"I was having this exact issue last night. I thought it might have been because I was on wifi so I switched over to a wired connect and that seemed to reduce the frequency off the error. 

I'm playing on a PS4 slim btw."

"Kinda hard for you to argue that when there are maps, guns all ready to be released since last season...  It's not that people dont know it's a yearly support, it's that MW's experience is actively being held back by activision.  Just think back when CW launched on a friday, out of no where never before have they removed STS at the end of the season on a friday and by then it was gone.  Or the 7 day sale on premium bundles that lasted less than 12 hours because someone up above wasn't happy MW was getting some attention."
Bro they have guns in the file from day 1 of mw that never got released they will save the assets for the next mw title cause the game will run on the same engine with the same mechanics like just look at it from a business stand point.
"I could see complaining after they announced the integration because they made it seem like it was gonna be supported. But at this point it�s very clear they don�t have any intentions of supporting this and just want you to buy Cold War.. buy Cold War, buy it, buy the battle pass so you feel like you have to buy Cold War to get the rewards."
Integration was only for warzone and warzone was the product of mw its how they can get away with wording it unfortunately
"I mean look at modern warfare 2? That game was supported after the next release, black ops 3 was getting updates for like 2 years after release. Mw19 has been completely abandoned so people will buy cold war, I mean I just got a 17gb update for mw19 even though nothing was added, I think it's fair that people are upset at that?"
"17?

Mine was 28GB (PC)."
"Mw2 wasn't supported at all lol, the game had an intense fan base the kept playing the game, They never added anything after the first year? Like I said the games always come out for one year then get ditched"
try smokes with thermal smg and rpg+nade through windows or into their fav spots
Yes this.
Tdm is the only game mode that just sucks in this game. Anything with an objective shouldn�t be too campy.
"I play on PC from Asia servers and I'm really curious since I've never had as much trouble with the amount of campers I've encountered so far since I've started. Maybe one camper per 4 games on large maps.

I encounter more slide-canceling Roze players more than notorious campers."
Not to make assumptions or anything but most players in asian servers are sweats. You must have seen all the memes talking about players with asian characters carrying the team and its kind of true from what you�re saying. Maybe you�re just being put into good lobbies because you are good.
"If you�re new that�s the problem. Its not that you�re bad its that the players you get matched with are bad. In low level lobbies, I suggest running either shrapnel or spotter as your 3rd perk. The game is nice when it comes to entrances so you can easily flank campers. Even if the have claymores or betties, if you run spotter you can hack them, sneak up behind them and execute them. Executing is useful in low lobbies because if they get executed they usually quit the game so you dont have to deal with them."
"> Executing is useful in low lobbies because if they get executed they usually quit the game so you dont have to deal with them.

I didn't expect a reply so hilarious to my post, will do!"
"Okay so this happens but my playstyle is antagonising campers.

I get verbally abused daily by these campers and honestly its the only reason I still play lol.

If you want tips etc I can give you some but I only play ground war so there is that"
"Play hardpoint, that�s literally all I play and it�s a tonne of fun, got me Damascus and currently going for obsidian on my WZ weapons."
"It's a very ongoing argument. In a perfect world, we'd all run and gun. But - people are people, and they get impulsive to do whatever it takes to get a VTOL, or whatever. And that usually means camping. I play hardpoint, and interestingly, though campers still exist, there are less of them, because the objective constantly moves. -- Still though, assholes find a way to ignore the objective, and get killstreaks in a 2nd floor window somewhere. Ultimately man, you just have to get good at recognizing it's going to happen, and whacking them where they sit. And start enjoying it. I LOVE whacking campers.

&#x200B;

But yea. TDM is retarded these days. Camp central. I don't even bother."
"Don't play TDM or SND! No fun and no action at all because of the reasons you mentioned. Some people may like this overly tactical, campy playstyle but for me CoD has always be action and fun. That's the reason why I find pleasure in domination, hard point, headquarter and kill confirmed (camping is an issue too in this mode but campers usually don't win because they lack medals due to immobility). I really like CoD:MW with these modes."
"Huh, I completely forgot about dom and the other gamemodes you mentioned...I only had TDM enabled by default, that xplains it. I'll try them out"
Holy shit this playlist update is bad but at least shoot the ship exists
SHOOT THE SHIP STAYS BABY TIME TO GRIND FOR THE BLACK OPS 2 MIXTAPE
"I thought the season was resetting today evening, I was a couple levels away from being able to blast Rick Astley while running people over. Now this moment is gone forever.

Good luck with the grind!"
"I've come to love Ground War very much, from S06 until now, and that is what I'm playing most of the time still.

A relief for me personally to see it in the playlist still, after so much time.

Cheers to you OP, that took some effort to put together."
Man you're going to be disappointed about the no tanks thing it has ruined the balance of GW pretty much haha
HOLD UP ZOMBIES IS BACK?!
"If it's like it was last time, bomb objective moshpit might include NVG maps? Will test later tonight 

Seeing as those modes are in quick play they should just go all out and make it an NVG only playlist"
*Aaaaaaand of course no Reinforce. Sigh.*
Lower your settings to the minimum and enjoy your 100+ fps. Turn all the unnecessary things off. It will be impossible to reach 240 fps with those specs though.
"Ok ty, I�ve heard MW uses 10gb RAM? Do you recommend getting extra RAM?"
"That's definitely not right. With my old 1060 6GB I got around 90-110fps. 

I think the main problem is that you have 8GB of RAM, you need at least 16GB to have a good experience. Also, what CPU do you have?"
"AMD Ryzen 3 2300X Quad-Core Processor, 3500 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)"
Don't get me wrong here but unless you play on 640x480 with minimum settings you will not see 240hz or even 144hz.
"CPU is what kicks in at 1080p. You want at minimum an i7 8700k, or above to gain more FPS. GPU doesn�t make a lot of difference at 1080p as the CPU becomes the bottleneck."

Only thing I can think of is your last knife might have bounced around a few times and got someone after you died.
Bouncing in slow motion
And the anger when you're killed by the pewpew Cold War toy gun instead of proper guns made with passion on MW
Agree 100%) kindergarten water guns looks more realistic than cw garbage
"You do realize they nerfed every single CW weapon. They nerfed the Agency Supressor so CW weapon are pretty useless now, unless you are using a SMG"
"One word... money. They make cw guns broken so that losers who don�t have skill buy cw in order to level up those guns quickly. Its that simple and it works. At one point even i was thinking of getting cold war back when the dmr and mac 10 were broken but then i found the p90. Despite the entire meta being cw weapons, there are still some viable weapons in mw. I personally use the bruen and mp5, but the amax and val are also meta. The hdr is still the best sniper (from what I remember) and cw doesn�t have dragons breath shotguns (but don�t use it cuz everyone will hate you)."
Go tell people about it on the Warzone sub then. This is literally not a problem for MW players.
"I mean.. fortnite is the exact same system, paid cosmetics, a battle pass with free and paid tiers, its free, and has gotten updates and new content regularly for years. 

Overwatch, street fighter 5, pubg, siege, destiny, I�ll be real with you pretty much every game anymore has a similar system with longer term support with free and paid content. It�s kind of just sinful that Activision has the highest premium to play their game for multiple years."
"You are right, they can, that is why they are all hands on deck with Warzone now. They are trying to make Warzone the next Fortnite, directly competing. Warzone is obviously making more money for Activision than ever. That is their cash cow now. What I meant is they have no interest in making MW a multiple-year title, while they do with Warzone."
I expect a working game
"You are acting like the game was released yesterday. What exactly is not working with the game right now? Beside not having the 3 new guns, some maps and an operator? The game is over-shadowed by CW and WZ but it�s still playable and enjoyable."
I don't need anymore weapons or operators except probably for MacTavish.I only need a playlist that's actually fun to play like Shoot the Ship.
"Exactly. I came back to MW just cause I felt like playing it. Never got damascus so I still have a reason to play. Plus I can level up the battle pass for CW at the same time - a game that is getting updates.

CoD has been like this forever, but it is a shame."
"True but I mean that was a well-spent 60 bucks, I had all I asked for. Maybe not all but at least I had and are still having fun. I bought for the gunplay and that is all the reason I have."
Everyone on here are throwing their toys out of the pram over a little Cold War ads placed on MW lol these people need to get a grip.

Prestige icons have been bugged from the very start. I got to Prestige 7 also but most of season 1 it was showing a Prestige 1 emblem even though I kept changing it.
"B
U
G
Yay!"
"Same issue here. And it's not just the prestige icon. The soldier rank is reported incorrectly depending on which part of the game (barracks, vs. lobby vs in-game) you are viewing it. 

Its clear they haven't integrated the tracking/progressions system properly and MW multiplayer is getting very little attention. This has been reported numerous times."
Thats not new
OP was using 0% of their brain
It's been in the game for a long time now....
"It�s been in a good while now. This would be relevant if you posted it in the BOCW subreddits, since the situation there is worse than it ever was in MW (you have to read every single new unlock for every weapon you unlock for, whereas in MW there�s only a notification if there�s something for the weapons in your classes)"
"It's been in the game for ages, at least half a year, probably much longer than that."
whats this movie called? cant remember
Lucy
How TF this is getting upvotes lmao.
What is this about? I'm confused
[deleted]
Uhm this is the MW sub Reddit sir
What haha
"It should be noted that the CoD points do work.
So if you have completed the Battlepass, and you have 1000 cp just lying around, you might as well buy it for the 1300 cp."
"The messaging is a bit deceptive but you get 300 CP for �free�, so unlocking at max rank is basically at 0 cost or benefit in that respect"
"Neither did the season 1 pass.

The game is past it's life cycle so it won't be getting any substantial content updates.

The cross progression is meant as a means for people to be able to play MW and still progress in CW too."
"Yeah i bought the season 1 pass thinking it was for MW, since it was in the MW store. Kind of shitty of the devs to sell and advertise CW stuff in the MW menu's."
They've also removed post match statistics! What an abject shame!
post match statistics? what was that for some reason i cant think of anything
"I�ll only buy it if I reach 100 completion. It pretty much pays for itself right back. Might as well get the stuff like skins even if I don�t even play Warzone. But yeah it sucks that we can�t even use the freaking Calling Cards and Emblems we unlock in the Battle Pass, there is absolutely nothing technical preventing IW & Raven from allowing us to use those things, Activision simply doesn�t want to."
"You can use the emblems and calling cards in multiplayer, the war tracks too. Everything is else is strictly CW and WZ only though."
"I got the season 1 one out of  habit then was like ""wait why did I do that""
10% xp woo"
DOH!
"You get all the cp back so i don't think getting it or not is a factor. Considering how they maniacally track EVERYTHING related to purchases i'd say it's important HOW/WHEN you get it. They're gonna take into account if you actually buy cp to get it, if you already had the cp to get it, or if you get it at the end after you've gotten the cp from the pass itself."
"I�ve bought season 1 only because I finished the BP, and knew I�d get all the points back plus own everything in the pass. Couldn�t hurt me at all. 

I�ll do the same for season 2, if I make it through the entire pass. If not, then I won�t be buying it."
"Except if you play enough and reach max rank, you get 300 extra COD points for free, which can be used on anything"
"technically if you can finish it, it's a net profit of about 3 dollars, but I get your point."
"Didn't even finish the season 1 pass because of this. 

They could have added the cw weapons to mw multilayer. That would have been lit but oh well"
"Yep learned it the hard way on season 1.  
Anyway I'm done with these greedy woke F, I'm uninstalling tonight when I get back."
"This is the stupidest post I have seen. If you already have at least 1,000 cod points get the bp and finish it you�ll get more cp than you put in."
i got it for the xp boost
"Yup, I been robbed in cw season 1, now HELL NO."
"You should of titled your post PSA FOR ALL MW PLAYERS....   

too many who don't real the gamer ezines of follow COD in tweets went out an bought Season 1 not knowing there's nothing in it for MW.  Same same for Season 2.  I play MW mostly all time, sometimes a little WZ.  

But.... there's a Leaker out there that says maybe they're releasing the DLC intended as MW Season 7 around March 11th.  So mebbe we finally get something?"
Hunter looks so much better but what about the other two milsim skins?
Wish they had told me i was spending $60 for them to stuff a bunch of fucking ads in my face everytime i want to play a game of multiplayer
"Now thats dumb

Like really dumb, ads in a game that you pay money for, i could understand f2p but no thats just unacceptable

I send my best regards to you in wishes that those ads stop bugging u"
"Im pissed at this so badly

Im only playing campaign nowadays due to cold wars shit

The multiplayer stuff is broken nowadays"
"Yeah i hate that, it sucks and i know for a fact im not getting cold war, early access was good enough to show me its garbage"
"Am I the only one who assumed this was the case anyway? Why would they be pushing mw stuff the years over. They're just pepping for their next release, probably when the nuke goes off"
I�ve not played since the end of season 7. They�ve done what now??
That warzone pic lmao
"what are your pc settings, your game looks so smooth"
i play on an xbox series s
"I personally just want to play modern warfare again, with weekly Playlist updates and shipment or shoot house and mind my business. But it's dead, so horribly abandoned dead."
"Honestly crazy how they come out with nice higher tech guns with MW like the amax and then come out with guns that look to be decades old and ran through the mud in the Cold War and some how they do more damage, high bullet velocity etc....GET OUTTA HERE! It�s a joke! I�m literally laughing. I can go on and on. Show me someone that�s actually happy about this that isn�t new to COD or BO....seriously. You just want noobs because they will buy whatever�s main stream. This zombie shit is for one over rated, two so so sooooo cheesy and not the good kind. NOT EVERYONE IS OBSESSED WITH ZOMBIE BULLCRAP."
"What better games are coming? COD is one of the biggest franchises who is going to compete with them? 

The only reason COD nearly lost it a few years back was because they were in the ""jet pack"" stage which nobody liked and then Fortnite introduced free battle royal. Now that COD has the free BR there's no ""new game"" that will knock them off for a while"
"New content in mw according to leaks will start at March 11th, keep your faith, as we all here)"
Doubt it just hope the new battlefield game will absolutely be good maybe them cod will try i just wanna shoot damn commies in an Abrams looking at you China
"This has been addressed multiple times. Unless it says otherwise, all content will be Warzone and BOCW. 

If it makes you feel better I logged in and was permanently banned for no reason at all and lost damascus and 50$ worth of cosmetics. I made a new PSN and I can play again, but it kinda blows ass that I�m never going to have my camos again. Might just grind dark matter in Cold War at this point."
"""Might as well play cold war at this point""

The words activision so desperately wants to hear"
how is a normal player that doesn�t keep up with the news suppose to know that tho? I haven�t played this game in months. and i come back and assume if i can view it in multiplayer mw it�s usable there.
I bought the season 1 pass for the sound tracks then realised it was free anyway...I didn't even  finish the pass
"Might as well have finished it and gotten all unlimited battle pass.
I just play outbreak right now to finish mine because warzone is dead"
"I don't want to be that guy but the battle pass does say that everything in it is for Warzone and Coldwar.

Don't get me wrong tho I understand where you're coming from but everyone knows how greedy Activision is and as soon as the new Call Of Duty comes out they stop supporting the old ones except with minor dlc and updates."
You new to cod or something? The last game always gets left behind have done for the past 14 years cause the developers do need to work on the next game
"CoD (and Activision in general) was so out of touch for so long, now they double down on their retarded model after success of MW2019. 

Every other game on market stopped annual release bullshit and splitting the playerbase. CS:GO is most played FPS game on the market and it was released in 2012. It went through tons of Seasons with new maps comming all the time and old ones getting remastered. It will switch to Source 2 (new Valve engine) in 2021, since it's still running on Source engine that didn't get a major update since 2008.

Same with Fortnite. Remember when Fortnite BR was a shitty free addition to Fortnite the Game, the one you play pretty much tower defense? Took Epic years to turn Fortnite in what it is. 

Same with R6 Siege. Game was dogshit during release, barely broke 5k active players after 2 months on Steam. Devs sticked to it to fix balance, add new maps and weapons, they kept improving it and it's arguable 3rd largest compeative FPS on the market after CS:GO and Valorant. 

Activision after slow decline of series since CoD: Ghosts finally got a diamond in the rough with MW2019 and what they do? They double down on their retarded model of releasing new game and splitting playerbase.

People would pay $60 easily if new Black Ops was just a big campaign addon with Zombies for MW2019, while giving some skins for multiplayer of MW2019 and Warzone. Every fucking weapon in Cold War could be just a blueprint for MW2019, prove me wrong. They could even add few weapons to MP if they wanted to like AWP. They didn't need to add TWO AR15 (XM4 and M16), they didn't need to add 2nd AK47, they didn't need to add 2nd Galil."
"Come on dude, that's only true to a degree and you know it. 

Every CoD dies, yes, but never before has the old game been used as one giant advertisement for the new one. They actively make this one a chore to play. Unlock pop-ups mid-match for CW? A battle pass that nets you zero unlocks for MW is in MW? All the menus it takes to even get to a match? You can't call this  ""left behind"" because it's still updated with irrelevant content. It's not wild for players to be unhappy with this system. 

If they really and truly let the game die and had left it in the state it was before CW, there would be nothing to bitch about. But they didn't, so here we are."
People need to start understanding this system and how its never gonna leave.
Anyone who lost all his COD points after the season 2 update just like I did?
Please god let me uninstall warzone it's so shit
"I can't wait until battlefield 6 comes out so I can either love it and play it, or hate it and never play any more first person shooters."
"I doubt very much there will be any new content for mw, their trying to kill the game so their not gonna add more guns . They want all the sheep to buy cold war , and the sheep will buy ."
Why would add content to the game thats already ended the cycle though? Would it not make more sense to release the new guns and blueprints when they release mw2?
[removed]
"Activision just likes to cuck their dwindling playerbase, like with the whole shipment playlist thing."
"YOOO

For real?"
"The guns will probably come sometimes after this. To be honest I don�t know, maybe they want to keep the WZ Outbreak Event in the limelight by making those guns initially exclusive to WZ, or they have different plans for MP. I really don�t know, all I know is when enough people find out about this and it take them longer than they should to add guns to MP, it�s gonna be a massive out-rage."
They were supposed to be for season 7 but believe it or not but you can actually unlock it and level it up for when it releases. You have to unlock it in mp and level it up in survival coop.
they are coming as a March update to MW specifically
RAAL is not tracking on Xbox

I haven�t even got to try it yet but that sounds disappointing as hell.
"For real.  I like this game, but it seems like they are going out of their way to break our hearts.  I might just skip season 2.  After 5 games, I couldnt take it anymore."
They train and stadium is gone??
"All the metro stations are boarded up again, and the stadium tunnels are closed off again.  Its like everything that had an underground component was erased to put in the new bunkers at the monuments.  Did they need to erase stuff to put new things in? They were at max capacity and needed the room?"
The actual outbreak mode is in cold war and the free event is going up tomorrow.
"the 25th, to be precise."
"That isnt good enough, wow a free event to promote Black Ops Cold War. Its like Activision are trying to kill off MW and WZ"
"Im pretty sure I just played the outbreak mode in Verdansk.  It isnt even a separate mode.  I got most of the unlocks for the ""Outbreak Event"" already. Its live now.  In the main menu for Warzone, one of the tabs is the outbreak event tab like what they had for rebirth island and the halloween event.  Its definetly live already."
"It gave us misery and pain, nothing but suffering"
Story of my life
"Cause warzone and modern warfare are just adds spam for coldwar. The way they see it is ""if you are so curious about the zombies just buy our 80$ game. If you don't we will still shit on the game you like tho"""
"Diamond Hands, never buying Cold War.  N.E.V.E.R."
"""Welcome to CALL OF DUTY MODERN COLD WARFARE ZOMBIEZONE!"""
i bet that if the zombies are going to spread all over verdansk people are complaining about that...
Its easy to criticize. Fun too... lol
"Wait... Taking out areas from where MW has put in?
Wow talking about further shitting on IW & MW's work."
I don�t think it�s that deep. I�m pretty sure it�s part of the story line. When we get a new map are you going to complain on how it�s shitting on IW work?
"Ok can someone explain the Zombies on Verdansk. I wanna complete the Warzone event challenges. Last night I started Plunder and the 1981 ship was on the map and ppl were flocking to it (near the prison). Never saw a single zombie, just regular players. Where are the freaking zombies?"
"Zombies are inside the boat. The back is blown open, you can get in through there. Headshots put them down in 1 shot."
"I think its going to be more of a thing, the more days go on. If you head to one of the new areas, there's a display, with a skull and 5%. So potentially tomorrow it could be 10% or w.e and the zombies could slowly spread through the map. Ultimately could lead to the map being full of zombies and then we move onto the new map.

But I agree, it's a total cluster on day 1, 90% I can't get close to the actual ship right now, but this is similar to the stadium opening up and that becoming the main area."
"Yeah, that would be cool. Lets see if it happens or if it ages like milk."
[deleted]
"Yeah, ima gonna play Hunt: Showdown till they get their shit together."
"They got rid of missions as well ,so I can't get ruby rampage now"
"According to pro gamers and the people who leak content, the word is that the toxic barrel's in the water is the start and that slowly Verdansk will become infected and each season it will get worse and eventually be nuked. The people who's channel's I watch haven't been wrong about any content, which begs to question who at Activision or Treyarch is leaking information or if these so called leakers, work for either company because no one ever says a name, just a username of some sort. You can't even get the blueprint at stadium and I don't think you can at bunker 11 now either. It's a bad move. I was talking to a buddy about this last night and it would be cool to just add more maps and location's then have one big map. Wiping Verdansk out though? Guess we know what that nuke is for now at the park."

"I mean, the game is 2 years old at this point. Have the ever kept updating a cod game after the new one came out? They push Warzone as game as service but they don�t push the stand alone games that way, so it�d make sense they wouldn�t update the old game much. 

That said, activision is scum"
Why would they update an older cod? Does everybody really expect them to always be updating the game?
Truth. Preach brother.  Make them separate games. Dont force people to download shit they arent going to play.  Its like they doing it to me without consent. They are download/ content raping us?
"most people despise warzone?

Are you ok? You seem confused."
"Wait... uh you're bitching about CW's Season 2 on the MW subreddit?!  Can you take your damn skippy ass over to the CW subreddit and join the chorus of sad souls?  LOL  You're talking to the MW players that haven't gotten any DLC since Season 6 and with each update breaking the game for weeks before they finally get around to fixing some of it!  

\#moderwarfare\_brokenbyupdate #moderware\_stillplaying"
Its time for a new map for war zone bruh
"Leaving apart what OP says, neither gave us the timed exclusive blueprint missions, or new blueprint missions.   
No new weapons.  
No new maps.  
To me, they not gave me back my lost fps in the previous ""update"".  


Instead we have new CW battlepass.   
A new exclusive CW game mode.  
New ads.  


I�m so sorry for IW. Their masterpiece was doomed and fucked by Activision.   


And you, skin buyers, keep spending money on them to say to Activision that they are doing it well."
"Did you know that cod games release on a one-year cycle? You know normally whenever a new cod game releases, the previous game gets little to no support. And, well, if you haven't noticed yet, IW has moved on from MW and they are working on their next game. Also if you didn't know, we are getting new weapons. An LMG, SMG, and a Pistol. So MW probably won't be getting anything new after these weapons drop. Don't get your hopes too high."
"I dont know why your getting downvoted. Youre right. IW has a masterpiece, and these other developers just fling feces. Tragic..."
Take my upvote.
"Ok i didnt realise they did that

I knew about the zombies and shit but

Holy fuck there idiots

Like ima go off rq, ever sense seaon 1 and 2 of cold war

They fucked up everything

It puts the game to shame only good part about it now is the campaign

AND IM LUCKY I HAVE IT

If i didnt is be on waw rn with my broken controler playing zombies while thinking what excuse the devs can come up with this time

Ima guess by season 3 were all gonna say fuck this game watch it go"
"You need to chill out and play something else. The Lego series of games is pretty good and they never update or add anything new in, so you should be happier."
Dude multiplayer is still the same
>Holy fuck there idiots
"[no no no, the BP season 1 and 2's stickers are now working on MW guns](https://i.redd.it/seeqlcxew6y21.jpg)"
"You're crazy.

Season 2 brought us Rust and Khandor Hideout, two of the best maps in the game.

Also the Ghost operator came out in Season 2, and the Infected Ground War game mode.

Season 2 was pretty awesome actually."
Cold war/warzone season 2 bro
"Lol, yeah Actual Season 2 was good. This ""So Called"" Season 2 they released this week appears to be, how do you say? DogShit."
Did anyone even care about the spec ops/warzone story? For me only the campaign counts and it will be totally fine when MW2 getd released. You will get a short intro what happend and will understand what happend.
"Yeah. Alex survived which I guess is relevant, but otherwise I haven't cared at all about the ""story"" after campaign."
I definitely didn't care because it goes off the storyline.
"I stopped caring about the WZ storyline after the integration. At least s1 to s6 was grounded and somewhat believable, but now we've got a shipwreck that has a fistful of zombies in it :P"
I dont count anything passed the main storyline as canon
The fucking audio is turned up so fucking loud in the warzone intro. What the hell is wrong with these people
People pay attention to the story in this game?
"They've said they have no plans adding it a long time ago.

It sucks since we have crossplay with PC so they get another advantage of a bigger FOV"
"That blows. Wish they would still consider it. I haven�t tried playing BOCW, but the FOV setting makes me want to try it out. Do you play BOCW?"
They set the game settings for console to be played at max performance. Which is why u can�t change a lot of things. There�s only so much that can be crammed into a console. They give you what should be the best you can achieve on console gaming. If you want to be able to customize settings to the max on most games you need a PC. It�s always been that way and never going to change. Plus they�re having enough problems as it is keeping the game running properly. It�s the most played game of a generation and it�s been difficult to keep it optimized for all playforms. I�d never buy a ps5 or a xbox again. I�d rather just save for a monster  pc that can be upgraded and have a lot more control over my own gaming capabilities. Which is what I did this time around. Consoles should be obsolete by now
I understand what you mean. Just thought maybe they can squeeze in the FOV at a more reasonable distance. The FOV difference between pc and console is too much. Gives a bit of an advantage.
"cold war looks way worse so its easier for consoles to run?? no idea why they dont try to add to consoles, cuz yea 120 FOV is sweeeeet"
120 FOV? I smell a quake player ;)
"Never lol. Why would they? CW is out, they don't give a shit about MW anymore. Don't expect any substantial changes to the game anymore."
but but but... CW looks cartoonish. Hahah kidding. I get what you mean.

"Two options:

* Have fun with what you got for 60 bucks, don�t complain, avoid taking CW ads so seriously and just enjoy the little corner called MP, and you don�t expect for updates or fixes, this game is borderline dead in their eyes. Then yeah, this game is still fun.

* Don�t buy this game.

I�m not kidding, the only way the enjoy this game is get the hell out of this sub when you�ve received your game and just play it."
This subreddit is a real bummer. I come on here for the memes and funny clips but half of the top posts are a circle jerk of how this game has been abandoned by Activision and how everyone is quitting COD for good.
"If you like multiplayer and just ignore all the CW bs, it's still pretty fun. There seems to be a decent player base in the US. Idk about Aus though"
Yes if you can handle things getting broken in updates. The game is fun but they fuck up stuff with updates and right now updates are sparse so anything which breaks may never be fixed
"I've been playing it almost daily since relase and haven't gotten to the point of leaving yet, so I'd say yes."
"Nope. It's now two updates where they change nothing but you need more space. On top of that you need to download warzone even if you don't play it totaling at a massive 220 GB for a game that isn't getting new content and left with gamebreaking bugs.

It's sad. I loved MW. But it's not worth any amount of money anymore."
Yes
Idk I got perma banned for no reason so I�m pretty pissed at this game.
No
No
"Been playing for 2 years

Personal opinion campaign wise yes

Everything else wise, fuck no

Multiplayer is shit

Warzone ie shit

Co-op is cool

Campaign is hell yea

So if u love campaigns yes

If u love multiplayer hell no"
So spec ops is good to you but multiplayer isnt
No. No. Absolutely no. It's shit.
Fuck no
Pretty low at 23mbps????? I have like 1mb in my hometown.
"In comparison to many people's internet nowadays, it's slow.

And I'm talking about megabits, not megabytes btw. In megabytes it's about 3mb/s down give or take"
"Not trying to hate, but what�s the reason for having that slow of internet?"
This is literally the fastest internet I can get in this area. I live on an airbase lmao
"Cod has  always been big I mean always from day one so no point complaining now after all these years, I�ve had to sit and wait for hours my self when downloading but that�s apart of life can�t have everything with a click of a finger, also don�t seem like the game an issue but your memory and internet not the game"
"This is the first time I've ever owned a cod game. 

And what do you mean? I have more than enough space to store the game. It's just the amount of space it takes up is absurd. I've seen games with greater graphical fidelity and more content take up half the amount of space as this game."
He lined up the red Dot on his compass which is your position
It's easy to wall bang on shoot house but not enough until you get a better clip of it
"Wouldn't say so.

Looks like they know that bit where you can shoot through into that area 

Plus FMJ is a thing"
"No shit sherlock, I know you can shoot through walls but HE SHOOT ME THROUGH THE WALL AS THOUGH HE KNOWS MY POSITION"
"Sorry, but that�s not enough evidence for �wall hacker�. You don�t appear to have a silencer on that K98 which means you appear on the minimap when you shoot. You were shooting, so he knows where to look on the minimap and all he has to do is shoot based on where his minimap icon is pointing. That�s a common place for wall bangs."
If that's so... then explain to me (not in the clip) how he was able to shoot exactly where my teammates are?
Bro you are just bad af if you never sprayed through a wall lmao
"He clearly gets a hit marker on your teammate before he runs to the corner and shoots through the wall, good play... Move along"
"Instead of trying to blame boogyman hacks immediately like a lot of other people do already, maybe it would make you a better player to try and figure out how they could've done a play like that, so you can do it yourself"
"Reported for being a cry baby. This is not wall hacking. Did his scope snap to you through a wall? No. Did you give away your rough position and they are smart player? Yes. 

Get over it and move on."
"Yep, the game is definitely going to be ignored. It's COD. They just churn out games, support them for a year, then ditch them.

It's a real shame, cause a game like MW, if it had regular updates, could have sustained itself for years, since it had a pretty high interest.

Just a damn shame and a wasted opportunity."
Look how long GTA V has been kept alive. MW could be the same.
"True. It's the first FPS since Blacklight: Retribution that I really love. Nothing better than building my own weapon and having different skins/operators. Customization and good gunplay in one game is kinda rare.
I will play it as long as possible. And I think/hope/dream that others will do the same."
"Just give me Shipment 24/7 as a permanent game mode. No I don�t play the game just for that, but as someone who works a lot  it�s so much easier to get Damascus with that playlist."
"CX-9 and RAAL LMG are warzone floor loot currently.

MW is supposed to be getting a ""season 7"" on march 11th according to a credible leaker, but ill believe it when i see it.

But for the last few weeks/months it does seem that yes, MW is no longer getting dev support"
Infinity Ward are most likely working on their next title.
Yup lol [Here's the link](https://www.gamesradar.com/new-call-of-duty-2021/). It's most likely MW3
"I think they�ll probably even go as far as messing with matchmaking to make it seem like less people are playing, with activision it seems like they�ll do whatever they want"
"They do that already I'm pretty sure.

Atleast I've had days where it's impossible to actually get in a match"
At this point I'm not spending any more money on cod games the devs can't even handle cheaters. They ignore all the issues in a title and just try to pump out skins and shit that costs money. The franchise has become a money grab not to mention they have made millions of dollars and don't seem to care about the player base
"I think the fact they reset the season count and all new battlepass content only has stuff for Cold War and Warzone and nothing for COD MW + they reset all the player levels to 0 as if COD MW just no longer existed and the past years of playing on it meant nothing to them pretty much shows how much they value their player base and their intent for the future.

Meaning they have no intention to continue supporting their MOST SUCCESSFUL COD GAME TO DATE. COD MW 2019 sold the most copies of any COD game in the history of COD. But should they continue to support it? Well apparently they don't think so, COD Warzone I guess is far more financially successful I guess and they keep trying to get more people roped into Cold War despite that having sold substantially less copies than even previous CoD titles.

Which is a shame I was hoping they'd keep supporting COD MW longer this whole annual COD thing just needs to stop. Guess in any case yet again I will just have to wait 5-8 years before I buy another CoD game."
"Fairly certain that the IW devs have a update planned, but Activision won�t let them release it  to help boost sales in Cold War"
"We are getting the weapons at some point, since they are in warzone ground loot now, but yeah, they don't really care too much about MW.

Only reason we're getting those weapons, and maybe even ""season 7"" as have been leaked, is because it was already finished content from last year, just never added. Doubt we will get anything else after it.

I think it's pretty stupid to stop support after a year too. It's even worse because there's 3 different developers making the multiplayer games, and they are all very different. I like MW, even if it has flaws, but CW is a COD that feels like it's made for kids with all the ridiculous things and how the weapons handle. Some of it is the engine, but even then, black ops has always been very different, and attracts different players.

Now we seem to be getting a sledgehammer WW2 game this year, so it's a long time until there's another COD I would play outside of Warzone. Dice is the winner here with BF6."
the unreleased weapons are ground loot now??
"Is anyone really surprised? This is how it's always been. New year, new game. They want everyone to play the new one."
there's a cx-9 blueprint called serac that is ground loot in warzone right now
"It�s not supported anymore ( no more content ), but you�ll find lobbies easily thanks to cross play."
Wasn't Season 7 content just leaked? It's supposedly going to align with the Warzone map update on March 11. New guns and maps. Am I stupid?
But we should all keep playing it to show activision that modern Warfare is better then Cold War and yearly realese are bad.
Yup. [later this year](https://www.gamesradar.com/new-call-of-duty-2021/) is the next... Smh
"Just because the game is not getting support, does not mean it�s dead this game still has a strong player base."
A game every year doesn't make much sense because the player base will have terrible time with matchmaking. A lot of players would be hesitant to move on to a shinier new toy every time it comes out. I hope MW retains the player base because I want to go back after I fully level up all CW weapons. I don't care for camos.
"Tbo I don't care if they support it or not , MW have almost 60 Maps and alot of weapons it take forever to make alot of classes and try them all , for me idc cuz i stuck with MW until next IW title release"

"You can actually open up the Token menu by pressing ""3"" on your keyboard. Have fun!"
Thank you! :)
"i have 76 double weapon xp tokens

I spent some money to get those noodles which give you a code for double xp

thats annoying"
Damn that sucks.  I had around a hundo as well.  Maybe they want to slow down the leveling process
Mine showed up after pressing R3
"Pc here sadly. No shortcut for getting to the tokens. There normally is a bottom you click on to get to them, but that bottom is gone."
"I fixed this by opening Cold War, starting a XP token, then going back to WZ. The button to activate XP tokens now magically appears."
"I have this issue too, just started to hit a lot of random buttons on my keyboard, looks like the default for tokens is the ""3"" key; pulled it straight up.  This is not signified anywhere in the options menu, but try that :) Finally  works for me!"
Yeah that was almost too smooth to be true
It was probably a fluke if you're going to camp in a container it's pretty obvious where you will be
"Aren�t that container and barrels within, normally bullet proof?"
"The barrels inside are bullet proof, but the red wall isn�t which means you can get kills with walbangs"
I think he was hacking only because of that second kill. If he were to shoot anywhere he would�ve shot the back side not somewhere in the middle.
"This capture is me. I wasn�t hacking, I just know how to use a UAV. If I was hacking I would�ve made sure it was a headshot."
Do killcams show body heat from a snapshot grenade? Maybe he could have used one without it showing on killcam or the most possible scenario in this situation would be that the guy in the container had been camping there the entire fucking game and he knew were to shoot.

There's a setting under crossplay to allow audio from other devices asides from PS4. You just have to select it. I was running into the same problem  for like a month
Im not seeing anything under crossplay that pertains to audio on pc. What specifically are you talking about?
You�re playing on shipment. Just gotta expect it.
How doest this work?
"it dynamical reduce your ingame resolution to reach a minimum FPS

for example if you have average120 fps ingame.. with dips down to 80 in some scenes where much happen (explosions, smoke  and more) it reduce your render resolution to maintain that 120 fps

this setting is the only reason consoles can get near 60 fps ingame"
this can boost FPS .. Xbox and PS4 going down 720P do even manage near 60fps on some scenes
"I Testet it and its a very great Feature. Getting near stable 240fps with my 5950x and a 6800xt.. normaly about 180-250fps..
I didnt even See a different ingame"
Apparently this is some unbranded nVIDIA DLSS.
Not really.. it works on AMD too.. there are a Games that allready have this Feature (assasin Creed) and it works Wonder to reach stable framerates without many Hits on quality
"I have to do the 17gb update now as well, with my shitty internet that's it for me with Shoot the Ship for some time (they will take it out today). It's the fricking Warzone stuff. I don't even want it, I just want to play normal multiplayer. This is ridiculous."
"Oh yeah I know all about shitty internet. Where I live we can't get legit wifi so I run off my hotspot so this 17gb update will take me about 2 days to download. It says my download speed is decent but it really isn't lol. I just hate how they add all the cw stuff to a update for mw. I don't care about cw, I just wanna play mw"
"I own MW on PS4 but have recently moved to pc just for warzone. A couple of weeks ago I had to download over 20gb for an update that barely affected WZ, it was just a bunch of shit for CW ??? Why the fuck do I have to litter my pc with stuff that I don't even own?!"
I know! Like coldwar is taking over modern warfare. It's taking a game I absolutely love and ruining it with a game I despise. I hate cold war and think it ruins the black ops name and it just ruins mw by adding all the stuff to it. It's so stupid
I�m prestige 6 level 1. When I play public matches and check the scoreboard my icon is still that of a fresh level 1 private the same as last season. This is just a visual bug but I�m wondering if anyone else has this issue.
I don't but I have seen a few level ones out there and it's probably pretty rare to be a level one at the end of season. 1
Wait to see how big it is next year when new cod gets intergrated buy a external just for the game
Youll need to own a whole new system just to be able to run the game. Mw already slows my ps4 down a bunch. I hit the share button to save a clip and by the time the menu pops up I'm already done in the match I was in and halfway through a tdm gamd
Next game will just be MW2 multiplayer (which is already made). So Infinity get 2 years to develop the next COD title
true tho
Cold War and Warzone only
MW is dead. Battle pass is for WZ and CW. Don't buy it if you only play MW.
"Activision doesn't care about their COD games after a new one has launched, except for warzone ofc.

Maybe we will get the weapons that already exists in the game for survival mode at some point down the line, but I doubt we will get anything else after that."
"i am a new player and am also confused about the rewards.

i just had a quick browse at the season 2 battle pass and dont see many MW rewards except for a few boat/vehicle skins and xp tokens. Am i right in saying this?

also with the new outbreak event, i dont see any rewards that can be used for MW, is that also right?

how can i tell as a new player, what rewards can be used for MW? its kind of confusing for me @.@. Does it have to show the MW symbol next to the reward to indicate that it can be used for MW? thanks"
"you kinda came in right as MW is dying. sorry let me rephrase that, the community for MW isn't dying but the support is. Most likely we won't be seeing anything new for MW in the future, it had a good run and it's one of the best cods imo"
"there are no battle pass awards for MW, at all. Same as season 1. They are ALL usable in Warzone though.

The only thing you get that's usable in MW from battlepass is the 1300 CP back and the 2X tokens."
"you really can't.. 

nothing in the battle pass works for MW besides XP Tokens and COD Points, the rest are only available for use in Warzone or Cold War"
Just get cold war???
These new battlepass is pure garbage. Pretty much gives MW players a giant super sized middle finger.
At least give me an option to hide the motherfucking battlepass tab so I dont have the clutter and can navigate the menus faster.. smh
"Lol,MW is still getting one more big update months after the latest CoD released and people will still complain"
"Get on the new game. Every single time a new cod comes out people like you say ""this previous one was better"" 

Honestly its all the same. You are competitive against other players of various skill levels. 

I dont care about the balancing of weapons perks and items. I don't care if people cheese. 

The only reason call of duty exists to me is to win the matches against other players. We all have the same game. We all have the same advantages and disadvantages.

Everyone says rpg sucks so I take an rpg and slay people with it. 

My point is, what the fuck is your point? Battlepass is garbage because it focuses on the new game? 
I repeat myself everytime a new cod comes out people like you just get frustrated"
"Yes, but i think that the the guns and operators that got leaked might be released soon."
Only CW and warzone stuff
"Fuck cw operator walk lobby screen, copy mw, bp not worth to buy, garbage  cartoon operators and guns."
You�re complaining about an animation in a lobby screen
yes
"Jesus christ, thanks goodness. I can comfortably wait now."
the playlists already fully updated early so shipment will be staying for a week again
"Nice to know, but I�m much more of a ShootHouse tho."
Thank God.
"Sadly, probably not for too long."
Yes praise infinity ward
The only maps I�m getting are shipment or shoot house even on quick play.
"Devs probably care and are crying on the inside. Activision on the other hand is responsible for this and is also the reason for SBMM. 

Activision is not the devs"
Agreed
"The worst thing is that I've already bought Cold War.  I'll play it from time to time but I just prefer MW.  It's so stupid that I have to get advertisements non-stop for a game that I already own but don't want to play, while the game that I've already invested well over $100 in microtransactions is treated like it doesn't even exist now."
"I unfortunately resonate the most with this. They got me with the hype. I was most interested in the story. The multiplayer seemed iffy to me during the beta, but not so much that I believed it couldn't be fixed. The story was short, but fun to me. I enjoy things that mess with your mind. When I started multiplayer though, which is the main reason KEEP playing, I wasn't feeling it. I've tried it multiple times. Even with friends that like the game, but I don't enjoy it. 

I like MW a lot better. I've put a good amount of money into it as well just because I wanted to. I felt the game was worth it, and I knew what I was getting into.  Now it just doesn't exist to them. So yeah, same page man. It's sad to see."
Still not playing CW. No wonder I feel freer than ever to do something else and not have the itch to play another CoD game again
This is a Sony issue. Basically there needs to be enough room for the game to copy itself and download the update. It's extremely stupid.
"My ps4: brooooo clear some space apex needs to update

Me: bro i've got 80gb open, the update is only 51 gb

My ps4: but its not enough

Me: JackieChanWTF.jpeg"
I�ve been an avid Sony user since the PS1 days. Still so frustrating.
Oh so Sony didn't get rid of this bullshit copying and needing 100GB of space for a 10GB update with PS5?! Wow...
"They did, but only for Ps5 games."
"I have mw on an extended storage on my ps5 so I don�t even care about the space since it�s 1Tb, but they should make warzone a stand-alone I don�t play it like that and I�m tired of getting 20gb updates for warzone when I just wanna play mw."
I saw that I could but I can�t do this anymore. Very odd.
those 20GB updates are 99% cosmetics so I got bad news if you think Activision will ever stop cramming them down your throat
Same on my PS5. It's bullshit.
Wholeheartedly agreed.
"This is an absolute farce, I have literally nothing left to delete and I own a fucking ps5"
Sony said this issue was fixed for the PS5.
"i have base ps4 500gb. i only had cod mw and red dead redemption 2 installed. red dead was ~110gb, cod was ~200gb plus another ~10gb in videos plus mandatory apps left me with more than 150gb free space. today when it tried to download the patch it told me i have to free up another 22gb(!!!!). so i deleted red dead, turns out the whole patch is just 17gb. well done guys"
Get yourself a 2TB HDD for like $60. Never have that issue again.
On top of these huge updates. Does anybody else�s account make them Re-download their multiplayer/ compatibility packs each update ?!? It�s ridiculous
Not every update but more often than not.
[deleted]
It didnt take too long for me but the fact I lost space for other games is complete BS.
"Not only did they keep the garbage copy system that asks you to have a more than 4x the space to download an update, the also kept the 500GB hard drive on the ps5 perfectly knowing they were fucking over people. Games are often more than 100GB in 2021. Fuck sony."
I have the same problem on PS4. I shouldn�t have to clear 170gb for a 30gb update (this actually happened)
"PS4 is different because the way the system functions (and they've admitted this was stupid) is that when a game updates, it downloads a copy of the game with the update, then copies over your specific data, then deletes the original old version. PS5 they said they changed that tho so I don't know"
"Welcome back to sony consoles, where the update installations make no sense and you never have enough storage space.  The whole reason k bought this game for xbox, downloading and installing all at once is so much better than preparing the download, downloading the update, then copying the entire fucking game to the hdd and requiring double the space of the update/game. For the same 51gb update for apex it took 2 hours on my ps4 and 27 min on my xbox to install. Its literally how the ps4 storage works, and also, MW doesnt have a next gen version, so you are downloading updates for a ps4 game so its treating it like a ps4 game."
"Clear space, restart your PS4 and try it again. It�s all fucky but if you restart your PS4 once you�ve cleared just enough space it should work that�s what I do."
Clearly didn�t read the title my man. I mentioned that this is on the PS5.
"You aren�t the only one I�ve seen saying this happened to them, I understand your frustration I�d be pissed as well"
"I bought the pass yesterday at tier 100 and only recieved 2 items from it, support guy told me to restore my licenses but I had to go then. Now it's already season 2 and if his solution doesn't work, then I'm not sure if they'll help me at all.
Edit: didn't work, shit game"
"Was literally missing half of bar to max out the battle pass. Woke up earlier (Yurop here, just past 7 AM) for few fast Plunders to do so... only instead to get this."
"Yeah I'm very upset as well. I was a tiny, tiny sliver away from hitting tier 100 on the battlepass. A single game of ANYTHING would have completed it. Suddenly I was given a force restart due to update required and bam, once it was done I am in season 2 with no way to complete season 1."
But the season 1 pass didn't have anything for MW in it. Why were you gonna buy tiers for content that you can't use?
I think they base it off of Eastern Standard Time? Cause it�s was 9pm PST and that shit told me to fuck off and updated it.
"Not really. I'm EST and MW said the Battle Pass still had 2 hours to go right before it kicked me. I already completed it so I'm good, but I definitely understand OP's frustration here"
You had 80 days.
Lol right
"Gonna get flamed for it, but this is the real answer."
"Camos work, skins don�t."
"\^\^ but also take caution, before buying the camo, preview it on your guns, the camos look good on some guns like the fennec, but on others like the AX-50, it only covers the stock."
"I can't be the only one who thinks the new cdl packs suck balls? 

Compared to the 2020 ones, they look like shit."
The CDL 2021 skins look like a sock puppet
Idk I just picked yes lol.
And its because treyarch was to lazy to make skins for all the operators
can i use the camo in regular mw multi?
Leme know what yall thought about dis
"What's the build? Fellow d Nov fan here, planning on getting it obsidian once I'm done with damascus this week"
"i just put on everything that increases ads time with the lightweight suppressor OR bipod being optional based on how you want to play. 510mm compact barrel, tac laser, ftac stalker scout, FMJ (personal preference but you can do sleight of hand)"
Awesome gameplay
"Once you get the 2nd barrel and stability items, this gun slaps in groundwar. I use 3.5 scope and no tac laser and i know for a fact ive been reported a few times for some of mt flicks."
It is literally a bigger deagle with a better scope. That is the problem with the gun. Can you get kills with it? Sure. Is just about every other gun better? YUP
Never seen anyone else anywhere near this good with the dragunov. Thanks for sharing this!
The dragunov gets nulov
Nobody..I mean literally nobody I�ve seen using the Dragunov in Modern Warfare 2019...getting a one shot kill is impossible...
Ngl I love using the dragunov. The plus the plague sore variant looks unreal
New magic wand
This is some really cool editing. Big up there. Also...this is the only sniper I will use.
thanks :)
Str8 Nasty
New Magic Wand slaps
"Getting this gun to gold was one of the most painful experiences i've had with a sniper, i had a better time with the crossbow. But hot damn did it feel good counter sniping ax50s, kars, hdrs, mk2s, and rytecs with it."
i know how you feel. I got damascus before switching to pc and it was horrendous using the dragunov but its so much fun now using k&m
Good clip but tik tok is shit
"I used to love gaming as a kid but now it�s just greed. 

Nobody cares about making fun games anymore, they just care about making money.

For example Vincent Van Gough didn�t announce his paintings a year in advance. And cut corners to meet his announcement date. He didn�t give out half of his painting, but you have to pay to see the other half. And he definitely didn�t drastically change his painting after he finished it. There wasn�t a �part 2� 

He just sat down and worked on it until he felt it was perfect. He created a masterpiece. 

Game devs can be like Van Gough, making truly inspiring and fun games. Then corporations come in and start fucking with everyone�s creative vision, then people get complacent and greedy, then you end up with today�s gaming atmosphere of shameless ripoffs and shit quality. 

Fuck the gaming industry"
"Yeah, seems like only indie devs actually care and are passionate about the games they make now"
Imagine comparing cod to Van Gogh. Fucking hell what are you on about
"> No new content in battle pass. I guess Activision doesn�t need to say it at this point, but They want MW to die and for everyone to move on so they can shut down the servers.

MW2 servers are active. I think MW4 are still active. MW2019 will not die even if people move on. 

In addition, CoDs have always been an one-year cycle. Why are we surprised that MW2019 no longer has support when a new one is out? Guess what will happen to CW this year...

> PM, Scorpion, and RAAL still only in Survival and not Multiplayer, Warzone, or Spec Ops.

I'm still holding out hope on that rumor that said that MW will get a content drop early March. We may see the guns there. 

> Kill and unlock tracking still doesn�t work. My LMG kills with Minotaur don�t track, my kills with Wyatt don�t track

Not familiar with this bug, but didn't people say that it is a visual bug that you are seeing these missions?

> Warzone map is garbage. And frankly, I wish Battle Royales would just die off. If it was a stand along thing, fine. But Warzone has taken away any and all effort out of MW, and CW.

That's what's making the money right now. You may not like it, but their banks don't go with your likes/thinking. 

> If this crap keeps up, I�m not buying anymore Activision CoD�s. I kinda want to just erase the game and go back to CyberPunk 2077.

I just bought the game and haven't started it up. Any crashes/bugs for you?"
I�m on ps5 so cyberpunk for me has been a blast my only issue was crashing but it was fixed with the 1.1 patch. I�ve already 100% the game so I�m just waiting for dlc and expansion. I�m going for obsidian on every gun in the meantime
"We're not supprised, just hoping there was a change"
[deleted]
I'm guessing those guns drop with the new Warzone map.
"You know, the problem isn't MW don't get content anymore, the problem is why the hell I need to download 28GB of patch to play multiplayer when there isn't new content."
"Warzone is shit. It�s literally the worst aspects of a game brought forth.

Yeah they are chasing money....that�s the problem. Nothing good every came from chasing money. 

And here the other thing too. Most people playing Warzone exclusively...don�t enjoy it. They are rather, hooked on Cuz of its casino mentality thats fucking addictive to the right people.

Just cuz something makes money, and is addictive doesn�t mean it�s good...think sugary drinks, or Drugs"
"Imagine the amount of money Activision will get if they continue to support MW19, but no they are fucking braindead, I'd imagine old the old farts on the management smirking thinking they're smart.

Fuck em."
"They're good at making money, at least give them that. If there was money to be still made with MW, they would."
I only multiplayer in mw. And will play for 2 more year. Not going to buy cold war. Not going to play warzone. Because I've played straight 3year pubg every single day. The battle royale genre I'm not going to play at least for few more years. Besides that battle royale has so much downtime. U r kind of idle most of the time
It really doesn�t have any downtime. What are you talking about?
The RAAL and Scorpion are ground loot in warzone not even joking right now. It�s rare but it�s there
Well that just makes their absence from multiplayer worse...
I heard a rumor that MW content was coming out on the one year anniversary of Warzone. Not sure about it tho
No chance
"I doubt it, or if it is. Probably gonna be only for Warzone."
I still believe we will get a content drop that said my self and millions of other love warzone and br so just Because you don�t like it don�t hate so hard br will not go anywhere anytime soon in any game that said it does take away from a lot of multiplayer effort out fourth witch does suck but it is what it is on the other hand battlefield 6 will be this winter and it will be the absolute shit and honestly If it does as well as me and a lot of ppl think maybe it will put the boot up the ass of the cod developers to get there shit together or lose a vast amount of the player base I play cod and bf played the shit out out of 4 and 1 5 was absolute shit so came back to cod but I�m hyped as hell for the new one
"Yeah millions like BattleRoyale...know what else millions of people like? Watching  the Bachelorette, and Logan Paul. Doesn�t mean that�s a good thing.

Also, Warzone is free, that most of the appeal and it has Casino Mentality built in. So on top of a predatory practice it�s also leaching away resources. 

Everything else you said I agree with."
Battlefield just isn�t good man. The br isn�t going to be good either
"You made sense until you said go back to cyberpunk. Different experience and it�s COMPLETELY BEYOND broken. I get it that Activision sucks but it has been like this for years. This doesn�t sound like someone wanting help, sounds like someone bitching. DONT BUY A PRODUCT IF YOU DONT WANT TO SUPPORT SHITTY BUSINESS PRACTICES. Like you did with CP2077 and it�s half finished nonsense."
"The game doesn�t crash for me all that often and I�m two trophies away from a plat.

But as buggy as it is. I have more fun with it than MW multiplayer."
Someone explain to me what the intro at the beginning is about? What story is that part of? Does it affect the game in any way?
No it doesn�t. It�s just a cinematic for Cold War and warzone
"> The Cross leveling is still there giving me heads ups for weapon unlocks for a game I don�t even own, and don�t want to own. (Cold War) 

They are never going to fix this, because it's intentional. Thank god for the ""clear new indicators"" button."
OF COUUUUURSE ita fucking 28 GB as well why wouldnt it be
Ok always nice to see a sweaty player
"I don't think I'm sweaty, I don't use meta loadouts, I've never used C4 or Semtex and I prefer guns like the Galil, AK, Uzi, Oden etc.

I've never used the Roze Rook skin either and I have over two days of Hardpoint time, I play to win, not for K/D, which is only 1,3 anyway."
Galil? In MW? Huh
"Yep, been in the game for like, a year."
"Yeah. The new ACE variant though, not the old Galil."
Shot the ship stayed god loves us
You mean shootshootshootshootshoot the ship
Thought the same thing haha!
Dude you made my morning! Thank god
For now..
">stayed god loves

 I hope that damn activision does not remove it"
Facts like you really tryna push the bs on us
"question - this is usually a deciding factor for if i want MW on my playstation. How long has it been here, and how long might it stay for? I guess its guaranteed to stay for atleast a week, right?"
Is shoot the ship the most popular playlist?
"They are literally leaving MW in the shade as seen in the corner.

I bought MW to play campaign mode and multiplayer, separately I bought BOCW to play campaign, multiplayer and zombies.

What I hated the most is the menu that MW and BOCW literally share, each should have their own menu."
How did you lose it?
just logged in one day and my account was reset. no warning no consent... just up and vanished
File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I�ve read that this will accelerate Activision�s response. I just did this evening
"I did this tonight, have you gotten you account back yet?"
"Dude, same!! They emailed me TODAY, actually. They said it�s taking longer than usual and I should give them a whole 5 business days lol Like, I�ve been waiting for fuckin months, I honestly thought you assholes forgot, yeah I�ll wait another 5 days."
"Yes, running 10900k and 2080ti and used to get 240FPS solid no drops at all, now all I get are frames skipping like children playing hopscotch during recess."
Temporary fix. Cap your frames 10+ what they're dropping at. Use to have this problem. 180 Fps dropping to 130-40 every 10 seconds. Capped my frames at 144 and kept playing.
Every time I run indoors on multiplayer my FPS drop to 20 even though im usually at 80-90 during warzone (with no issues) and multiplayer ONLY outdoors though. Been making multiplayer unplayable. Stuck playing shoot the ship since not many buildings.
Okay so I found the fix FINALLY after over a month with this issue. Disable Raytracing in graphics section. Thats what worked for me.
good shi but you gotta say they kinda botty
[deleted]
Where's the guy who jumps around the corner and quickscopes you mid air?
Finna get on now and see if I can tell lol
"Let me know what you think.

I swear it looks different and not in a good way."
wdym? did it fix ground war? because it's been looking like shit for the past 2 months
Dark colors are a lot darker and bright colors are brighter to the point it's a little harder to see the detail on objects from certain angles.
yes
Noticed this 2 but cant decide if its better or worse atm
"To be honest, I find it the most noticeable when I'm under the Operators tab. It sticks out like a sore thumb."
"I get the same, idk if it�s the sbmm prioritising sbmm over ping, but I�m fine on Cold War and any other game, come on to warzone and I get latency variation, on about 80 ish ping when I�m like sub 30 on Cold War, and so I get as you said stuttering and rubberbanding every min or so"
Cx9 is in the wz ground loot. We are close ... I hope.
Stay strong brother
Teasers if u will
"Fair, but I got my mom's sassy-ness plus a couple percentages so Im still salty."
Cx9 is in warzone but not multiplayer
The lmg is in warzone
But not the main multiplayer.
I bet they have more I think those 2 were just leaked for spec ops
"They ain't coming in any meaningful way, I don't think. Probably be some Warzone only shit. If they do come, watch them be unbalanced and never receive updates. MW is cooked goose."
I also noticed while playing earlier today that hit reg just isn't what it used to be
See the problem is you�ve worn out your hit marker. To get a new one you�ll need to buy BOCW.
"Damn, might have to knowing that lmaooooo"
WZ is the new call of doodoo now. My guess is they have downgraded the servers for MW in favor of WZ or something.
Probably not wrong thinking that. Such a shame that a good game gets abandoned like this.
"Use AX50. Confiq it to increase ADS. Stock, grip, barrel and laser. Scope it all up to you."
"Yeah AX is way more reliable, only pulled out the Kar because an enemy was SPR spamming."
nice game !
An other update an other problem
that is SBMM at its finest moment
"Also, I swear some people have extra health. This level 19 never died by my Kar or my AX shots no matter the placement. After the game the guy was like dude idk how you never got a one shot kill on me, all you got were hit markers. Yet everyone else was dying to my shots even in the legs so I couldn�t believe that perfectly lined high torso AND headshots were hitmarkers on him. Could just be his godly luck but still nothing is out of the question."
"You've gotta buy bocw to get it to work bro, just give Activision your money bro come on. Do you not have an xbox!? Smh."
I�ll give em anything they want... as long as my shots register.
I�m gonna have to go buy an external HD just for this fuckin update. It won�t let me do anything.
Remove the campaign pack on mw and any unnecessary special ops pack or whatever its called. (If you don't play that mode)
"That�s what I�m trying to do, but it�s saying that it�s not able to connect to the store when I�m attempting to. Meant to be more clear about that lol"
"I'm getting a ""Cannot install the update file"" when I boot up, but it isn't telling me how much storage to delete. 

I thought for the last updates, it told you how much space to make.

EDIT: so I just deleted 50gb (God of War, Hulu, and Funimation Now) and it seems like that did the trick. Downloading the update now."
Are you on PlayStation as well? Cuz you should be able to click �view error info� at least
"I�m in the same boat with my wife�s PS4. I�m fucking pissed. I can�t delete the campaign because it won�t connect to the store. All she has on the PS4 is literally MW, CW, Spotify, and 2 gb of game play footage. Storage says she has 310/408gb and states she has 97.X gb of free space. But we keep getting the error that says not enough free space for download. Still need an additional 9gb of space! Going to have to get an external hard drive just to play cod. And only cod apparently! This is beyond ridiculous."
I had to delete 115gb of game play footage for this damn update RIP
Honestly. I don�t understand why I need to basically reinstall the entire game every time I update it.
Did anyone else get hit with a 80ish GB update for MW?
"Price is the best, change my mind. Also, that does look cool."
you are now allowed to be my friend
What ?
I would love to see my favorite skins paint oh my gosh
"Whenever that happens, the whole enemy team just leaves."
"Damn that is impressive, nice job I didn�t know most of the things near the bottom"
"Helmet cam spectator mode.

That's sexy"
"There is a rumor, that you can spawn dark souls 3 mobs into warzone and modern warfare. When Activision helped publish sekiro, an unamed from soft employee got the source code for darksouls 3 and modern warfare. He implemented this configuration where if you have dark souls 3 installed, with the right code. You can use cheatEI to spawn monsters in multiplayer. There was a screen shot with 14 people shooting at the dragon slayer armor but I can't find it"
Smegma farms

"Once again the Season 1 and Season 2 Battle Pass both say that it's clearly content for Warzone and Coldwar. Sorry but there are so many post and people saying the same thing but if anyone takes 2 seconds to read it will literally say exactly what it's for.

Hopefully in March they drop more content for MW2019 Multiplayer.

Activision has always been greedy and when the cycle of a Call Of Duty ends they usually just drop 1 or 2 updates and leave it as is. 

And whenever the next Call Of Duty releases, Coldwar is going to get the same treatment.

Warzone definitely took the forefront when it comes to Call Of Duty and now everything will revolve around it."
When season 1 came out absolutely nowhere did it say these cosmetics are black ops and Watson only. They changed it about 3 weeks later
"They should have put some extras in the battle pass for mw, as I feel more people that play mw would have bought it. And I feel since all the characters are designed for warzone so they could easily be used in multiplayer."
Well it seems that Activision uses the battle pass to try and sell the next game when it comes out by mostly giving content for the new game and warzone. Warzone isn't going anywhere and will just update with each new game. And they already have your money for MW. They would rather sell you another 60$ game than give you more free battle pass content. Its a shame. But Activision is a greedy company. They might take pity and throw us a bone with some added content in this next season but I wouldn't hold your breath. Most likely it'll be cold war and warzone only. Just like it is now. The season 2 trailer clearly focused on those two. And the devs for MW have been dead silent about new stuff. Im not going to get my hopes up for the new guns or battle pass content tbh.
"No it won't, there was a S7 planned but it was scrapped for whatever reason."
That content will be in the next mw game
No its linked for good
"all calculated not luck or something /s

"Counter UAVs, Personal Radars, and VTOL Jets count as ground vehicles. You can complete the splinter and skulls challenge shooting those down. I unlocked gold on the pila, jokr, and strella shooting those down in addition to the other kill streaks. Shooting those and UAVs is how I�m close to platinum on the launchers, just have to finish the rpg."
"for the JOKR attacker/defender kills, go to Hardpoint and MELEE them with the launcher. Trust me it's a lot better than shooting it up in the sky and hoping it lands somewhere.

Also for riot shield, I did HC FFA and that worked for me. Lmk if you have any questions. I got Damascus without shipment/shoothouse 247"
"JOKR on Shipment objective modes works well, if you can stay alive long enough to get a shot off that is."
What was your playstyle like when playing with the Riot Shield in Hardcore FFA? Did you have a pistol as a secondary?
"Smokes in Shipment (and try to hide in a container) and Stuns in Shoothouse (double time with it). After a few game the SBMM will take pity on you and in theory you�ll find some easier lobbies, usually with snipers and not many tryhards"
"Oh and don�t be shy and ask people to run CUAVs for you, sometimes players will do you the favour"
"Good news, shoot the ship is still in the rotation this season for your shield camos and launcher kill camos. I did most of my launchers in ground war and all I can say is to mentally prepare yourself for the JOKR. Since you already dealt with the RPG (another mind fuck of a grind) I believe in your abilities. Ngl, going from the mental health deteriorating RPG and JOKR to the lock-on PILA and almost hit scan Strela was more euphoric than fellatio.

Let's just say I'm glad I don't have to grind the launchers anymore...

...until Activision bans me for being an above-average player."
"I struggled with the riot shield so much but playing hardcore shoot the ship helped a lot. Plus there was a nice person who let me kill them over and over again. But yeah, you can one hit kill people with the riot shield on hardcore it's just the 3 kills without dying that's pain because others can kill you as easily as you can kill them."
"If you�re working on the RPG, get care packages, the one care package and the 3 care packages, kill a high kill streak, and just spam those into enemy spawns.
Worse case your teammate picks up a UAV"
Lol. The FAL went from the worst AR in the game to the best gun in the game with what seemed like 1 update. It�s pretty balanced now
"I wish, but it�s broke. 

One tap to the head on an AR with that quick of a fire rate is not okay. In the higher SBMM �tiers�, good mouse users abuse the fal almost as much as the SPR."
"Of course i remember because i love the fal and i was going to gold the shit out of it no matter how shit it was.   
Oh boi it was a nightmare."
Uh... That's the Scar...
Gotta watch the entire video man.... I'm comparing the recoil of the two guns in the video.
"i remember how bad it was and i wanted to get get it gold, but i stopped the grind half way through because it was so painfully bad"
hows the FAL fire rate so fast
My thoughts exactly
Believe you got hacked I�m deeply sorry I wouldn�t know what to do if I lost my shit I hope you get it back
"Yeah, I had Damascus on everything, including the battle pass weapons - really, really fucking bummed right now"
"search the sub for ""acct hacked"""
Thank you
Did you have 2fa
I don't
I�m sitting in the same damn boat after the glorious update from last night. Had obsidian on multiple weapons. Activision is a joke
"Yeah, I was working on my fourth obsidian. Hilarious thing is, this might have made me buy Cold War, except all the shit I unlocked for it in the battle pass is gone too. Hooray."
"It says that you have unlocked them, but you really don't."
tf you mean now lol it's been a shotgun for a long time lmao
Hmmmm?!
Aah. that suppressed AX50.. a real piece of beauty
Oof flex tape cant fix that
Omg wow
"My favorite sniper rifle. I've enjoyed every minute of going for Obsidian for it, even if it took me a long time. It's also my go-to long range secondary in GW.

Also, that's a sniper rifle sir, not a shotgun. Satisfying shooting mate."
It's a shotgun now.
You beast
fire man rather die from a sniper than a shotgun anyday haha

And it should kill like that at those distances. Having it miss while you're practically feeding them the barrel is the stupidest thing ever in video games
The difference between controller and kb&m gameplay is so huge
attachments?
Bot lobby lol
Ahh yesss... Everybody loves a .50cal shotgun
"Apex's Triple Take is the best shotgun, change my mind"
"I think it could have been more relatable if ax 50 didnt kill someone in far range. Or maybe the title doesn't fit aljust as right cause you are only shooting in close range.
Nyc btw"
"One this whole conspiracy thing is dumb 


2 there isn�t gonna be a MW2R MP back a few months ago they confirmed it wasn�t gonna have a MP they were gonna port maps to mw (during its prime) but didn�t"
I am all for this loved mw2 and it would literally make me cream my pants to play it with current day graphics that said idk if they�ll do that they are ALL ABOUT MONEY that said yes mw2 multiplayer remastered would make them a fuck ton of money but also idk if they will do it to split there player base up that much imo Cold War is okay at best mw was amazing so just look at it like this brand new game (Cold War) there pushing bundles and passes for then add in a shit ton of ppl still play mw not to mention warzone and add in mw2 remaster also a new cod this year and next year is most likely the next modernwarfare reboot that like six games I�m down for it I�d play them all I just don�t know if there willing to divide it up that much
"I personally think this is a good conspiracy. Here�s the thing. No matter what Activision has said, you are right; MW2 would bring in so much profit, whether people bought the bundle for the operator or for the game. It�d be silly for them not to bring it. No clue what this $20 could be, unless it�s MW3 campaign related, but why have so many MW2 references thrown in there? Who truly knows but I hope. Nostalgia is a business. Us OGs are getting older, some with family/kids who probably no longer game. They need to take that thought into consideration before more and more people slip away from gaming."
"Plus, MW2R Campaign was released last March.

""Season 7"" is rumored to be launching March 11th, 2021.

Wonder if that will introduce MW3R Campaign and MW2R Multiplayer."
"I had something like that a little while ago, I completely closed the game then done a hard reset or whatever it�s called on the console, and restarted my WiFi jus coz and then I think it worked"
Can you specify on how to do a hard reset?
Good Enough
Thank you! :)
That second kill made my peepee chub
"Indeed, I peed white when I got that."
I think I shit my self watching the second kill I�ll be back gotta go check real shit this was still nice af
"I personally was shitting myself there too, I'm very glad the noscope connected."
Dopest i've seen this week if I'm honest
"That's very kind of you to say, thanks!"
"As a below average player, I will never understand how people quick scope. I spent a few hours a day for about 2 weeks and maybe hit 1 decent qs. This stuff is so impressive to me"
"Thank you. I think most of it is just from back in the MW2 days when I used to do it a lot. Realistically it'll probably take longer than a few weeks for your hand to develop the muscle memory to know exactly how much you need to move it to hit a shot, but that's essentially what you should focus on. I'd recommend maybe playing against bots; put as many bots as possible on the enemy team, put them on easy so they don't really shoot back, and then just use their movement and whatnot as target practice. It's a lot better than doing it in real matches, because before you get used to people sliding and jumping around, you need to get the basics down. Once you can comfortably kill the bots, move into real matches, and practice against the movement of other players. 

I miss plenty of shots too, shit happens, you just need to make sure that you don't get discouraged."
Quickscoping with the slower snipers like the ax 50 and hdr seems much easier on pc. I can only do it with the kar and spr on console. And i only see pc players sniping with these slower snipers.
"Honestly whenever I use Kar and SPR, I get way too many hitmarkers, and then that pisses me off and I just lose my whole flow as a result."
Mad respect but should of kept the ending a surprise
I've never won a single COD match because 1. I don't have xbox gold 2. I'm too scared to do anything because of the pro players
"Quiscope and playing Sniper, this is the style bro, this is the style ! You deserv so much more than thoses players who sticks to one META weapon :D !"
"God, am I the only party pooper who dislikes quickscoping? I used to play BO2 a lot and quickscoping was particularly rampant there, and I found quickscoping super annoying to deal with as the opponent. Imagine stepping out in the open for one second and getting headshotted for the tenth time. This is why I�m a flithy campaign main. Anyway, rant over."
that was really good though
"Damn this is nice.
I've been quickscoping since mw/mw2 and it has always been the funniest way to play for me.
But now with mouse and keyboard it's even smoother."
If your using a mod controller then that could be it?
haha no way
Certain ppl in this thread are why i hate this subreddit. Goodluck tho hope you can get unbanned. I get wrongfully reported too.
Got any proof like saved gameplay of accused behavior
They didn�t accuse me of anything I was permanently banned and I asked Activision why and they said they wouldn�t tell me I�m so fucking confused lol
You cheated. Thats why youre banned. Or your account got hacked and the hacker used cheats when you werent playing and got you banned.
"Yeah I cheated with a 1.04 post damascus and obsidian KD. I�ve never cheated in COD in my life. I literally know people who cheat and haven�t been banned. I was playing, restarted my game, and was given a ban message with no reasoning. I�m on console. I can�t �cheat� and the �cheats� that exist for PlayStation aren�t detected at all by cod�s anticheat (which they should be, this game has trash anti-cheat). 

What can you actually be banned for on PS4? Racism? Wasn�t doing that. Boosting? Wasn�t doing that. I just don�t get it. If I were cheating I�d definitely have better than bang average stats. 

The fact that some people actually have faith in activison when people get banned for no reason consistently and you have cheaters in major tournaments is beyond me."
Did they ban people for racist clan tags / usernames or for inappropriate game chat or conversation? Could that be it?
"My username wasn�t racist, neither was my tag. My friend�s weren�t racist either. It just sucks."
you couldn't change the tag even if you wanted to
"If it's a hardware ban then you can't play on that console anymore.

Oh and wait for the ""you can still cheat on console"" brigade to show their faces."
"Wait I don't get it, what's wrong with stating that? Isn't it like, the truth?"
"I created a new PSN and repurchased game. It�s not hardware ID, but it is really annoying because I had damascus and 300 hours on the game. 


You can cheat on console but they can�t detect it, so even if I was doing that, it wouldn�t have got me banned. I got banned for no fucking reason and now I have to live with it. It�s enough to make me redownload Cold War lmao"
The cw ones? Does every other thing work?
yes the Cold War ones and all the other cdl camps work
Looks childish

Bro come on.
"It probably won't be StS to get people playing the new Cold War stuff

If they really want to push people away it'll probably be Realism Ground War, 3v3 gunfight and Team Defender lmao"
"Lmfao. Worked last time

Hopefully they atleast bring 3v3 snipers back"
We got two weeks of shoot the ship last cycle. Let's pray to our Lord and Savior Jesus of Nazareth for another two weeks.
"I hope so. Cold war is keeping nuketown 24/7, and its been in the playlist since december"
bro i just have shotguns and pistols left for Damascus. if they keep shipment for a second week thats literally all i need.
Pistols are super easy. I got all mine done in a couple hours (well they were already all like half done just from having played the game alot but still). I even did the renetti too
Bruh me too slideshot looks sick but I didn't buy season 2 battle pass so I didn't get it :(
By we I meant to say I.
"I wish you could just equip any finisher if you have it. Slide shot is kinda cringe imo but Price's execution would be awesome for other characters, as would many others you dont see often bc everyone is roze or kreuger lmao"
Well it�s still letting me play while it�s updating so I guess I shouldn�t complain
"Not everyone wants Damascus (b/c it's too grindy, not worth it, or whatever). Obsidian is the perfect challenge for those who like to stick with one gun and want something to show off after grinding"
This. I never liked the way Damascus looked. And with obsidian you don�t have to use guns you don�t like.
I'm only missing the Riot Shield and Launchers but they are hell so I'll give up on Damascus.
"First congrats, second, i dont understand your concern, obsidian is a fat grind in itself"
"I agree, the grind is longer and more difficult imo. I've unlocked a few Obsidian myself, and ARs for example were quicker to unlock than others.

I am trying to unlock Obsidian for the HDR now, and am playing 2-3 matches a day for it to progress, takes too much of a toll on me to play more only for Obsidian."
yeah it took me almost a month to do my ax-50 obsidian( without STS). and my deagle took a week on STS.
"Funny enough my damascus grind started because I wanted gold on my pila, then I said fuck it platinum on my pila.. the rest is history"
"You�re a different breed. But, I�m in the middle of getting all launchers obsidian rn, I just got done with all the melees, which honestly wasn�t too bad, because I finished that up right before STS came back. I have a couple guns obsidian organically, but I�m actually grinding for it now."
You were so close to Damascus. Even went through the trouble of the riot shield. Totally understandable though. I don�t like obsidian much. I am currently 2 launchers away from Damascus.
my first and only is the riot shield. very easy to get only 750 kills
The launchers aren't that hard and you're almost there! I'd stick with grind. It's satisfying af getting kills with the jav lol
"launchers are not that hard to get plat. just use them on every class and play objective modes normally. whenever there are UAVs or something else, shoot them down. you will get them gold after a while without too much trouble"
"The trouble comes with the ground killstreaks, yea personal radars count, but no one uses them anymore for some reason"
Tbh I�m not sure about any of those but I�m slowly grind and max every gun in the game so I might get Damascus later on in the year.
I'm a scumbag. I have an obsidian mp5
"Grinding obsidian for Ram7 purely (because it's by far the fastest way) in shipment has made me realize how there are actually people who play nothing but shipment, use ""meta builds"" (hipfire smg, shotgun, as val) and spam stun/flash grenades and killstreaks all day long and think they are the best fps players ever because they do well in motherfucking **Shipment** :�D 

Also prefiring at all possible ""hot spots"" where the enemy is likely to be, occasionally they get lucky and apparently that's just peak aiming skillz."
Launchers were the most painful part of getting damascus. I think I would have rather done all the guns minus riot shield than get launcher plat again.
#saveyourmoney
Roze is not a base operator; she doesn�t have any base skin
"You probably got misled by that republicworld article. Someone needs to flag it and take it down its the top result when you search ""how to get black roze skin warzone"""
Yeah
You talking about the all black skins? Those were only available during a particular season's battlepass
What vanilla skin are u talking about? There isn�t one for her
"When you buy an operator bundle, you dont get the base skin it has. Only the the skin the bundle came with"
"This is true only for dlc operators. Like if you haven�t unlock Krueger and you bought a skin for him, you will unlock his base skins. If you you haven�t unlock nikto and you buy a skin for him, you will only have that one skin you purchased for nikto"
There is no vanilla roze?
You had to complete the battle pass to get those other skins
"She's a DLC operator. They dont have ""vanilla"" skins. They only have their DLC skins. So if you buy them then you only get the one skin. You had to get her black skin from the season battlepass she was in. Since you missed it, you'll have to wait until they release the season bundle that she was included in. From what I've heard they're going to be called ""vault packs"" and will cost money, but you'll get a lot of good stuff from that season."
i cant find anywhere this roze unmasked bundle?!
"I just bought the �Roze operator bundle� and am trying to do the stun and picking up guns challenges to unlock the �Near Dark� operator skin.
The challenges are not coming up for me, does this mean that I cannot unlock the Near Dark skin with challenges? Perhaps due to not playing when season 6 BP was on? 
Thanks"
Lol paying for skins
Just the base guns. Any gun needed to be unlocked via challenges don't count.
"Check here:

[https://damascus.now.sh/](https://damascus.now.sh/)"
I don�t have a solution but if it makes you feel better the new update can�t be installed until midnight tonight.
Is it going to be one of those lengthy hour long updates or the 5 min kind? Also any word on what it is?
Unfortunately the data can�t be split up on hard drives. This latest update has to be copied to the library. It needs double the space of the game to copy to library. You need to free up more space or copy the game files to a bigger drive
Did they just bullpup the M13 lmao
Or the fact that she has a MP7 in the calling card but didn't get a blueprint for it
"Don't know about Scar but this is a very old bug with the FiNN.

The simplest solution is to disable the on-demand streaming, or setting textures to normal."
"Idk how I fixed it but I turned settings all the way down and turned them back up again, probably forgot to turn on-demand streaming back on"
Then don�t do that
Your comment suddenly made the game work now (actually) thanks bro
None they're all stupid
Cringe
None. All sweaty.
They're not sweaty. They dropshot and jumpshot to make themselves believe theyre good
None. Pointless addition same as gears
Those skins give me PTSD of all the sweats I played against.
80 percent of the people i see with cdl skins are trash lol
I feel that tbh
They�re unusable in MW multiplayer so they are useless
I'm pretty sure they're usable but I'd definitely like to be corrected if I'm wrong
"I bought the seattle surge, and Ultra one because I like their colors. Only use the camos though so I don�t get called a sweat."
I�m pretty sure the new pack is only available in Warzone and Cold War so if you�re buying them make sure you get the MW version from last year.
Can u still get those?
The weapon camos work in mw multiplayer but its poorly implemented and doesnt always wrap around the gun.
Mara�s or Domino�s neither have the league stuff
The free ones.
congratulations u just committed a war crime

"Well, I just got banned for no reason (I�m on PlayStation), is my PS4 hardware banned? Is my PSN banned? Is there a way I can play again if I re-buy the game?"
I�ve been trying to link my account from Xbox to ps5. I�ve unlinked it an everything. But it keeps saying this. What does this mean THE GAMING ACCOUNT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO LINK IS ALREADY CONNECTED TO A DIFFERENT ACTIVISION ACCOUNT. PLEASE LOG INTO THAT ACTIVISION ACCOUNT AND UNLINK THAT GAMING ACCOUNT BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO RECONNECT IT TO THIS ACTIVISION ACCOUNT.
I managed to get mine working and realised where I went wrong ( I had to use a new battle.net account ) but for Xbox to ps5 I have no clue what the steps are!
Are the challenges for a season you purchased or just a random season?  Because there's a bug showing you missions that you didn't purchase and that shouldn't be available to you
"It might be the bug tbh, I dont remember if these were from the seasons, but some worked and others didn't"
"One thing I found was... if the operator is a Cold war operator... then you  need to use cold war guns for the challenges...  ie... if is says get 15 shotgun kills, you need to use a cold war shotgun not a MW shotgun."
"this bug has been around since MW launched, its a bug, no you probably legitimately have these missions, just progress for operator missions has been bugged forever and its very frustrating"
This happens in almost every shipment game

"Lol that's like me the first few weeks of playing crash. Straight up couldn't find those stairs. I even knew about the ladder outside but never knew where the stairs were. Basically I was a bot

Is this for survival or normal MP against bots?"
"I've just been playing normal multiplayer against bots. I think its absolutely hilarious they won't come up that last set of stairs.   they'll even hide and shoot from the second story of that hotel but theyn they run just to the last set of stairs and stop and run away lol 

Been playing forever and I just found the ladder on talsik backlot that leads to a mini roof  its right next to the little hole in the wall you can crawl thru.     I've also noticed when playing capture the flag the teams have  specific pathing they always use.  they'll always take the same route to try and get to the enemy flag"
I hate the bots can pull off impossible shots that no human could ever make.  I mean you're crouched behind a window half way across the map and some F'n bot ONE shots you with Glint you don't even see like you're stealthed and using a silencer how the F did it know I was even there LOL
"This is seriously hilarious. Playing FFA right now and whenever I get a kill that same exact bot goes all terminator on me and hunts me down, like its knows my exact location lol and just keeps chasing me until it kills me lol

revenge bots lol must be part of that revenge score thing.  one of em I was like WTF how did it know exactly where I was? i killed it, it came right to me as soon as it respawned."
"Who cares?

It�s bots lol"
"people who don't have the option of playing online MR SMARTY PANTS oh what you think everyone on the planet who owns the game has fast internet? shows how naive you are.  really don't think people with satellite internet are gonna be playing online. OR the people who who can't get ""starlink"" yet.    you're talking about the difference between like 14ms and 680ms. I don't know what Hughes Net latency is like."
I mean you're playing Shipment. It's a tacite contract you accept that anything and everything can and will happen.
"Imagine this: You die, spawn in and theres a guy next to you, he shoots you 10 times but cant kill you because of spawn protection, you turn and kill him, then he spawns across from you and you shoot him, he doesnt die and kills you because of spawn protection. How fun would that be? Waiting for spawn protection to run out before you could kill someone. It would just turn shipment into a waiting game. 

The real issues is the map layout and the spawning algorithm. 

PLUS there is a form of spawn protection in 6v6 with explosives where they just ""dont work"" when someone just spawns in. In GW spawning in your base gives you full spawn protection for a couple of seconds from all damage. Same in WZ rumble when parachuting in"
"I'm fine with that. There's other ppl to kill. And maybe sts can finally be 6v6 again.  There's spawn protection from streaks on shipment that's longer than reg maps, why can't it be for bullets."
I�m asking for protection from projectiles not bullets
Just accept that your K/D ratio is going to not be at its finest for shipment. Once you accept that fact the better a person you'll be for it
"You just gotta accept your fate, even with the spawn camping that happens on there too, gotta accept you fate and hope your team mates will help"
Chopper gunners on Shipment are brutal thanks to spawn protection.
"Back in MW2 and BO1, chopper gunners were just permission to spawn kill the enemy team for 30 seconds. You got your killstreak, you deserved some reward. 

Nowadays you get hardly any kills because of spawn protection and get shot down pretty quick."
4 had something similar to that
"https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-playstation-ps5-game-breaking-bug/

Try this"
"So buy a ps4 and buy the game again and transfer the data? That cant be the only solution, thanks for responding"
"If its not too much trouble, could you type out and name all of the currently downloaded packs on your PS5 for MW? My friend had the same issue and it turned out that the 3rd multiplayer pack wasn't coming up for him in the store. You have to search for it in a weird way. At least back then. That was almost a month ago."
I uninstalled it all and currently downloading the base game which is 93 GB and one Multiplayer pack

Could be a selected device issue. If you have a PS4 you could use remote play to use their better party system.
or just get a playstation

I�ve heard that minimizing the game causes this. Could be the source of your problem.
"Could be, it�s just odd that different display ports completely destroy or change my FPS. Any idea what that could be?"
The only way it sometimes works is when the display is awkwardly stretched instead of being at 21:9 like it should be.
They put it on 1V1 bro
3v3 faceoff has a few maps including aisle 9. Depends on the rotation though
I remember. We had the mode for just a week. It was so much fun!
"it's in gun fight, and gf tourney rn

Not a fan tbh, too many head glitch and corner areas with sight lines"
Which is why I like the actual game mode and not the gunfight version. It plays a lot different for respawn games
Check the missions challenge rewards you may find it there
"I have that one, its a rare season 2 reward.. not sure how to unlock it"
Because the guns are not out? And I think they patched it so that you can�t get the unlock icons anymore
Speaking of... are they actually gonna add them to the MP? Or are they forever just in survival?
Custuon the blow cause they doesn t want to modern wafare play in cod gamer
im sorry what the hell are you trying to say
What?
Godzilla had a stroke trying to read this
"For context: I was playing plunder and got this on my screen, reminded me of the Cold War into warzone integration screen thing.  Anyone else have this or know what it is?"
I've had this for like two weeks now and it's bothering me that I can't get rid of it
Don�t buy the next one? Have no other advice sorry and god speed
"Don't buy the next one what? It's warzone, I didn't buy anything. But it's a shame anyway that people get banned for no reason... I still have hope Activision unban me like they did for a few other users that they banned by mistake in the past."
It�s weird though cause the recent ban waves are confirmed and not mistakes like the other users.... if you were perm banned in the recent waves then it wasn�t a mistake. It even says in activision site that every ban was confirmed.
"Well I must be too good then, and they thought I was hacking, lol. But seriously, I used to play once in a while, completely casual. I'm telling you, this is a mistake, I have no reason to lie. If I was really hacking or doing anything else not allowed, I would have no problem to admit and I wouldn't be posting it on reddit saying it was a mistake. Yes, it was a mistake. I have no idea why I was banned, and my account was never hacked. I'm probably from the first wave of accounts that were banned in the past. As I told you guys, I don't play since august 2020, so I was probably already banned. As a matter of fact I was banned while I wasn't even playing.

And it looks there's nothing I can do to report this. You can't even contact activision if your account was perma banned. You can't login, no chat, no email, nothing, they simply cut you off and you can't discuss the ban. I never even received a notice, this was completely out of the blue.

For some reason [battle.net](https://battle.net) still shows my activision account as active in my games & subscriptions in their website.

Well, I'm not getting my hopes up about recovering my account, so I simply created another one. But it really sucks cause I lost all my progress on the other one :/"
Sorry friend but it sounds like you were hacked.
How can I prevent this from happening to me?
"Bad news man but your activision account was hacked and unlinked from your gamertag/PSN, happened to me and countless others.

You'll have to submit an account recovery request to see if you can get it back."
"Yep, your account got hacked and that hacker changed  @mail adress. Go to activision site or to your own @mail and look for a mail from activision ""you recently asked email change if you didn't ask this click this link"" or something like that, use that link and they will give your account back. Takes somewhere from 7 to 14 days to actually get your account back."
When you need activision support contact activision support. Reddit can't find your password for you.

I personally prefer the marksman rifles myself.
"EDIT: My Xbox sits in my cold ass garage. Ontop of my counter w/ nothing blocking the vents. I also took apart my xbox a couple weeks ago and cleaned it. However a month or so ago WZ/MW came out with this update. And my Xbox one X has been sounding angry ever since. And that's before & after the clean. 

ONLY THIS GAME DOES THIS!"
I don�t think they merge them so you�ll probably just go back to the old one.
They need more night maps in mw2. I hated how throughout the entire year we got 4 and only 4 night maps. We need a nvg version of every map.
"They had zombie verdansk, they could've done semi night gw.  Night time shouldn't be locked in realism."
"> Wish they would pin it to the lobby menu! 

We've been asking for realism to be readded to the menu since it was brought at a permanent mode. But instead they just broke the UI."
"Just a heads up, if HUD elements show up in Realism, inspecting your weapon removes them 

Weapon inspection triggers HUD elements for the duration then removes them again. Something else (dying and respawning?) also is triggering HUD elements for some reason without removing them. Very annoying bug that breaks immersion 

IMO they really just need an option to disable all HUD elements like BF1/5 have.  Best way to play TDM"
Is this a mode right now?
Wait are people really complaining that the previous iteration of COD is no longer receiving timely updates?
"Yes. It�s much better than any COD to date and CW is 100% a step down and a back step in terms of MP. 

Single player was dope af"
"I�m not complaining because of that. Where�d I say if they�re not updating the game I�m deleting it? I said if they�re updating the game with just store content and it keeps using up space because of said store content, I don�t want it."
"The actual problem is that MW users/buyers are handling with this updates when they do not have CW, or don�t wanna play WZ."
Because it took like a decade to get a decent CoD that pushed the standard way above what it used to be ?
For some reason people expect this game to keep getting updates even though the new one came out. I never got Cold War and don�t plan on getting it but I also expected this game to not get as many updates or new stuff added to it.
"Lift the burden the update is for black ops and some warzone stuff maybe 

Leakers  are saying that modern warfare is getting a season 7 but it doesn�t seem like it will they probably won�t release the guns and it�ll stay in limbo 


Free up the 200 Gb"
The leaked update is for March 11th tho
"If you have other games to download, then yes delete them. If not, having 200GB in your disk won't make your PS4 slower and it's only one click to delete them.

Leak says the new MW content release will be sometime mid Season 2. Definitely not tomorrow but the update will probably include them, just not released for us to play."
Yeah the glitching and lagging makes the game unplayable sometimes. That happens to me too now and then. And it will last the entire game.
"This was 10 months ago, still not fixed.

""I figured out the issue is when my stick is practically dead center pushed up. I turned on auto sprint and every time it�s at the top middle, it�ll cancel the sprint animation. I have to slowly lean left or right for it to be continuous""

That last update messed a bunch of stuff up."
I'm going to upload a vid.
Yeah. Modern Warfare is a separate game. You have to buy it. Warzone is free. You can access all three through that screen. Modern Warfare might have a larger player base tbh. People seem to prefer it.
Yes to all of your questions
"1. More than enough people play mw. 2. You buy it separately and then download it separately as well. That screen really is just a launcher that tells your pc to start up whichever game you select. Also Warzone is the free part of mw. When you buy mw you are really unlocking the campaign, multiplayer, etc."
Aw Man if you liked Cold War you will love MW
I play MW multiplayer exclusively as of about a month ago and its definitely busy. Also various forums and FB groups are full of people playing looking for friends too :)
"I found countless full games on Hardcore Demolition of all things and on top of that, I found these lobbies at 4AM on a Tuesday night, the game is probably played more than Cold War, atm."
""" How many people still play MW online? Probably not as much as Cold War ""  
Sorry I laughed at that. The reddit sub is twice as large as CW one, and there are indeed millions of players on both, more on MW than CW according to Xbox Live popularity rankings"
"I really enjoy the PKM with an rpg, amped, ghost and cold blooded. I typically run a trophy and an ammo box too"
"I would say the uav, white phosphorus, and either one of the care package options would be good for killstreaks. I would recommend the emp drone and the  weapon box for your field upgrades. Probably an lmg for suppressive fire ( the bruen or m91 with the biggest belt works great), then maybe a more mobile weapon like the mp7 to run around quickly, for you perk one, eod or cold blooded, perk 2: overkill or high alert, and maybe tune up for faster field upgrades 
Edit: the ammo crate is a better alternative to the emp drone/ and or scout drone"
"My support class is this:
Primary: CR-56 Amax
Attachments: monolithic suppressor, zodiac barrel, EXO stock, 45 round mag, FMJ

Secondary: RPG

Lethal: thermite
Tactical: snapshot( so you can wallbang w FMJ)

Perk 1: cold blooded 
Perk 2: ghost
Perk 3: amped

Kill streaks: Counter UAV, sentry gun, VTOL

I use this class when the other team is running heavy air support, you can shoot down most larger killstreaks (VTOL, and Choppers) usually with one FMJ clip and one shot of the RPG. Once you get good at this, you can usually shoot down the VTOL before it kills one or two people."
"It all depends on what mode you play if it�s core or hardcore.. I personally like sniping ax50.. or using the Amax for any situation. Hardcore spr  or as Val in hardcore i feel like those are the most overpowered weapons .
I like running eod restock shrapnel with snapshot grenades"
SUPER underrated gun perk is disabling rounds. When you hit someone in the leg they can't run and get a mini stun effect on their screen throwing off aim etc. Some people legit thought I used hacks when I had that perk equipped on a high fire rate gun. You should try that for suppressing fire as a support!
"I say it's likely your mouse.   Haven't heard of this being an issue before, and searching up ""mouse letting go of click"" brings up a lot of Logitech mice related results."
I was looking at something similar earlier. My theory is that it only happens in multiplayer since I usually go in custom games and warm up vs bots and didn't face any problem before hopping on multi.
"I get this now and then, I think it's lag, sometimes my gun won't even fire. The game feels off today for me, not rubber banding lag but ADS going and losing nearly every gun fight."
"> The game feels off today for me

This is weird, I'm not the only one then"
"yeah it is probably your mouse, i had this same issue with BF5 after a while (yeah i know, don't judge) only it was with my left mouse button. replaced it and it fixed the problem."
Do you have any mouse recommendations? I'm worried if I get another G502 the issue will rise again.
"Flames, bullet tracers, grenade explosion and generally post processing affects show through walls and seem ""overlayed"" everything else. Only recently started playing again, never did this before. Updated my drivers and noticing. Seems some change has messed it up."
"Meanwhile, I'm having serious issues with this strange screen tear/glitching from exclusively the character models. I can't find any help whatsoever online, and every fix I've tried hasn't worked.

In the game settings my refresh is locked to 165 and refuses to let me change it whatsoever. I've tried Vsync on, off, matched my monitor's refresh rate to the game...nothing.

I tried posting on this forum for help but the post keeps getting deleted. I'm going nuts, I just want to play the game.

Honestly I was more into gaining some cod points when I bought it lol
U do have the operator. It�s the first one in the pass. U just  can�t use it for mw multiplayer
Ohh I see I was looking in multiplayer! Thanks that's made it a bit better
Congrats I still have a little ways to go im at 88. But I just got to prestige 3
"You can use on WZ, if youre into that kinda shit, I know i am, but I didnt buy the pass"
"Wrong sub.  


You want r/CODWarzone"
patch notes anyone..?
Here is the video for it as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGr-EkSUQBo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGr-EkSUQBo)
I like the irony  that your name is Friendly Fire and a friendly VTOL killed you
Maybe they were warning him about the mine?
MINE?
!emojify
Bro this happens to me all the time with the damn rats
The amount of times I chase birds and leaves in Warzone...
"Under this post i got a random question ""is r/modernwarfare about gaming"" i kean im pretty sure it is"
you better have clicked no
Why the fuck are there birds on the map after minutes of gunfire anyway?
"Oooooo exciting and oh so cool, an AS Val in search!"
"Yeah my whole squad besides myself use 725, M4, AS VAL, and SPR. This one match I used overkill PKM and Bruen with 200 round mags and laid down �suppressive fire� when bomb was planted. You�d be surprised how many people decide to walk into stationary bullet streams lol"
I prefer kar98 and amax loadout. But if I want to win I go with the kilo and rpg. The rpg is only for super trashy people like riot shield and 725 kinds of trash. It�s nice to piss them off for a change
"Jesus, always fucking whining. Even on a post about a fucking seagull you manage to find a way to complain about someone else's loadout"
like you wouldn�t use one too
"Right. A seagull

[just in case there's any misunderstanding, I'm indirectly calling his friend trash](https://i.imgur.com/fErdzbT.gif)"
"Thank you for explaining the joke, this definitely made it better and doesn�t at all make you seem like you need to go outside."
"No, you're friend just sucks, and plays like an idiot"
"I�m having the same exact problem and even posted in this sub couple days ago. Except for me it�s the exact opposite. I don�t mind Promenade or downtown, but absolutely hate krovnik and aniyah and it constantly puts me in those maps. I played 15 games or so and not once did I see promenade nor downtown pop up. Maybe like 2 port matches and that was it. It�s like it knows what maps you don�t like and puts you in that lobby lol. They definitely did something. This just started happening last week too."
Yeah it started happening for me like 5 days ago. It sucks to be forced to play maps you hate.
"Probably because no one wants to play Promenade or Aniyah due to the fact that one side is going to get absolutely shit on and defcon'd almost every time lol

The bigger problem I have is the team balancing, seems like I always get stuck on a team that doesn't do dick to win."
"Kept getting promenade a couple of days ago, gave up and played death match instead."
"Sadly, ground war is the only game-mode I like. I can�t stand any of the others. I�m a big-time battlefield fan"
"I wish there was a quarry 24/7 playlist. They hit it out the park on their first groundwar map and every subsequent one has paled in comparison.

&#x200B;

Hopefully for MW2 they go boot up BF3 and look at what made those maps so great."
"EXACTLY. I�d play quarry or farmland 24/7. Farmland was the first new ground war map added. I hate pretty much all the others, but I�m forced to play them, which is mega-shitty."
"I thought I was going crazy, I�m seeing the same shit too.

I skip promenade, Riverside and airport. Now when I try to matchmake it only gives me one of those three. It literally take 10+ minutes and 30+ lobby back-outs to get one of the other maps.

Fuck IW�s algorithms, forcing me to play your shit maps isn�t going to make me want to play them."
Exactly
"Haven't had any problems, getting a nice decent rotation.

Absolutely hated Promenade in the beginning but now it's one of my favs"
"same they should make a playlist like farmland 24/7, river quarry 24/7, or tavorsk district 24/7 maps like airport are alright but I hate promenade boneyard and the other one on the side of the hill"
Love to learn the maps and respect the Skill and connection quality based matchmaking yes ?
They said that they don�t like the maps. Not worth learning if theres something better available.
[removed]
"Nah, I�d rather not take a color blind racist�s advise, thanks."
"As long as players keep buying games, nothing is going to be done about cheating. It makes the company a lot of money.

It's like the Chris Rock joke about doctors don't cure anything because there's no money in the cure. They make their money on the visits... They ban accounts and then allow these same people to buy more accounts. It doesn't matter if it's legitimate means or not. Either way, Activision/Blizzard gets their money.

How do you know there were no cheaters in the other 17 games? Because you died to a legitimate player? You won a game or even a couple games? Neither of these should suggest that there weren't cheaters in those games too. Maybe there weren't any in those games, but just because someone is cheating doesn't mean they get every single kill in the game, or that they don't sometimes die in game."
Plot twist activision is the hackers and they�re just tired of being bad at there own games
"They'd lose lots of profits if the anti-cheat actually did work as intended.  
There's multiple cheats out there anyone can buy. It's saddening.  


But like you said, we shall never 100% know."
"No such thing as an ""anti-cheat"" that's 100%. They have cheat detectors, but everytime the figure out how to detect a cheat, the cheat makers update their software. It's like playing wack-a-mole. 

And the ban waves help but many of the cheaters have 80+ accounts, they might lose half in a ban wave... It they'll make more."
And some people will be banned even if they�re not hacking and activision is not very good at helping with account recovery
"I have an idea how it works, I've been ""accidently"" banned for running a reversing software for coding my ""BnS Buddy"" app.(trying to find a timer bug issue causing memory leaks) and wanted to take a break, opened the game and it suddenly closed, then opened again and boom, got banned.  


Yet there's a lot of people still using hacks/cheats.  
AS you stated "" It's like playing wack-a-mole. "" It really is that.  
They can make their anticheat a lot of robust, but they don't.  


As someone else said as well, they would ""lose too much money"".  
And that's how I see this company. Striving to make money instead of helping out a legitimate user base."
Yeah but it would help.  At least it's *something*
"Problem is you dont know who's only wall hacking, who's soft hacking, or maybe you've been killed before you meet a cheater.  I dont play WZ everyday but when I do I always meet at least a cheater/group a night.  It's just not as bad as early days in wz where it was every game."
"That's PC gaming for you, major reason I switched to console and keep crossplay off unless playing warzone"
wrong sub
no u.
Nobody cares.
"Nobody cares today? Nobody cares about anything? Nobody as in nobody or nobody as in not anyone? Nobody cares about nobody? And if yes to the last one then I�d it that nobody is caring about another nobody or that not a single person cares about any other person? 

I don�t want to make the same mistake as everyone else you know, since I have a higher IQ."
Good to know the community never cared to start with. Thanks for the feedback.
"Yeah I'm still fucking around with Activision, my account was hacked over 3 weeks ago.

Their first response was that my account couldn't be found, I supplied some more info (basically all I have at this point) and am still waiting to hear back.

Honesty I've just resigned myself to quitting all together, I'm not going to bother starting off at level 1 again after losing a 40k kill account with damascus.

Whoever thought tying your stats and purchases (I can't play Cold War anymore either) to an account with essentially zero security or traceability was a good idea is an absolute moron."
"Exactly. It�s beyond me how Activision has allowed this to happen for this long and I understand having to fully verify before recovering account but just having accounts hacked in the first place is ridiculous. I thought it was an isolated incident for me but looking here and at activision forums, seems like a fairly widespread issue."
14 days for me (10 business days) and my account is not recovered for now :/ I hope you gonna have a better luck than me
"Just spoke to chat support, gave me the same runaround about waiting 10 business days. I can�t believe they�d allow accounts to be hacked this easily.."
"Took 2.5 months, finally filed a complaint with better business bureau on 2/16 and got the acct back within 12 hours. Having original activision name helps I guess"
Did the complaint with the BBB help at all with the recovery? What did you tell them?
I�ve just filed with BBB wish me luck on getting my account back! I�m at my wits end trying to get my account back. I really hope this works
Challenge is not yours. There's a bug in which you can see all operator challenges regardless if they are yours or not. For example if someone buys some mara skin they'll be able to see s1 challenges even though they don't own said challenges
"I don�t quite understand. The challenge says, �get 5 kills while aiming down sights with grinch equipped.� And it even has 3 more challenges to follow once I do that one. The final reward is the armadillo skin. So you�re saying there actually aren�t any challenges?"
Cinder block is one of my favourite executions in the game.
"It�s a sweat fest, move on to greener pastures. You could also just take things slow and try to have fun as SBMM will eventually put you in lobbies with lower skill players who aren�t following the meta 24/7 and bunny hopping. Honestly though it better for your psyche and well-being that you steer clear. I�ve managed to have some fun in cyber attack and search and destroy using off meta guns like the AK-47 turned into an AK-12 or AK-15 but other game modes are full of sweats using only the meta making using things like the AK damn near impossible due to ADS differences."
"change your layout to ""tactical"", it will let you drop shot without claw.

Also play a few games eventually skill based matchmaking will drop you down to the lobbies which suit you better.

But yeah if playing a few more games doesnt work the only thing you can do is ""git gud"" by playing more, learning the meta, analyzing pros, etc"
The state of the game at this point is super sweaty. SBMM has all but ruined COD over the years for the casual player.
The sweat fest is why I can't stand this game now. They won't fix matchmaking either
"So you mean warzone, not multiplayer.

Probably you just got unfamiliar with the game and need some time to warm up. Check [sbmmwarzone.com](https://sbmmwarzone.com) to see what kind of lobbies you're at."
The time to kill is way too fast I can't play this game
Well first of all the controller dosen't make the player. It definitely helps but you can do without. That said the skill gap is there and it is increasing every day you don't play. People of your level that kept playing through your brake are now much better than you and players that were already better are now even better than that. The lobbies get sweatier by the seccond and casual playing is kinda dead if you plan on winning. Now can you get back up to the level? Yes. But that means a good amount of getting shit on.
generally I'd say play hc. if that's not your cup of tea you can always add a tac laser and run granulated grip for extra aiming stability.
For the .50 GS I found aiming stability to be the most important attribute. Maybe try and stack attachments that help that as I found there was quite a bit of idle sway when ADSing. Hope that helps
"Hardcore, and try to stay still when firing, at least until u get the unlocks u want. then run mad akimbo"
"I�d say hardcore, that�s how I got platinum on my pistols"
"Play HC Shipment (you still have one day of shoot the ship) and mount on a lane. Don't care about people coming to flank you. That means it's just time to die. When you die, find another lane to mount.

This is the easiest way to get headshots with the weapons you're not good at. It's a good practice as well: when you do a few thousands of headshots you'll see the difference."
Single diamatti my friend.
"God. I remember this grind. The riot shield, JOKR, RPG and all of the other shit weapons. The feeling when I unlocked it was so good."
[deleted]
Sorry for enjoying the game.
Only time I�m happy to see a tank is if there�s one of these dudes on the turret asking to be shot.
Blows my mind every time I see it... like dude... why throw away a life? Does anyone get killed by those turrets?!
"you dont need to use the sykov (not that you even can), just use the renetti with mo money and you will get akimbo"
"Yep, same metrics. 3 kills in 5 matches with mo money"
"I think it's a bug, I just got duel weild yesterday with the renetties"
I�ve had the same problem. Says free bundle and you look and there isn�t one at all. Must be something they are working on. Doesn�t kick me out though so I�m not too sure why you�re having that problem
Try from the MP screen
Only happened in the wz menu for me.
"There is no way this is just a bug, it's an actual functioning third person camera. It's a feature that was stripped away last minute probably. But god I really want them to add this at least to multiplayer, Warzone would be great but it would also just be great to see the skins you bought."
"Exactly. I don�t see why they wouldn�t, they�d increase the value of skins. 

Since I mastered the timing of the glitch I did this with all of my favorite skins and recorded them. They look amazing."
"Doritos Drip on tha wrist, neat watch I�ve never seen before!"
There was a Doritos tweet you had to re-tweet early on and they sent you a code to redeem for the watch
I use the k/d ratio watch so I know if I need to sweat so I don�t go negative
why does ur k/d matter?
only real OG�s got this watch but wait wait wait.. you got the Dinner Time watch?
Yessir
Just posted a pic of it as well
Wait i got the doritos 2xp tokens for mw and the chip emblem for cw but never got the watch. Was it for mobile only or?
"No, you could get it by tweeting doritos, was first season mw. I got it too."
"Good ""o'l"" days of mw2019, i still got a extra code for that watch ever since they came out"
"you uh, still looking for someone to recieve it? i could trade some twitch prime codes i saved up, sadly started MW in 2020 during the lockdown."
Looking to trade it?
Wish I had it
Not every blueprint is always available even when in the store tab of a weapon. Bundles still rotate in that tab.
"Odd. I didn�t notice it did that, cause at some point I was able to view each blueprint that existed in the game in the same menu. I thought it only went in rotation for the store"
"go into one of your setups, equip the kilo and from there go to store (on the far right next to customize) - that (afaik) is the only way to see all possible guns that are able to be bought.   The store is weird, sometimes my friends have different things in there store"
Going to the armory shows all the guns currently available in the store
"I believe if you go to the operator selection you can find the Nikto one by highlighting him in selection and then view the bundle, otter on the other hand I think isn�t in rotation rn"
"Maybe OP referring to Ghost's ""One For One"" 1911 pistol that was included in the Ghost operator bundle.  It looks like Nikto's ""Blue Dwarf"" 1911.   btw if you swap tac lasers on these 2 it becomes pink. fo real"
Yes! I actually have that Ghost pack and it�s one of my favorite 1911s in the game. I love that green frontsight that the blueprint comes with.
"So something I didn�t notice here is that the �Store� tab next to the Gunsmith tab when viewing guns doesn�t show all the blueprints at the same time, and that it�s on rotation much like going to the store tab in the Lobby screen. I swear at one time I was able to view ever single one of them, but perhaps I was mistaken."
Wait something is wrong in the shop? Don�t worry it will be fixed in a couple hours
"Yea they removed the ability see stuff not currently in the store, it's balls. I've been waiting for gaz skin for months now."
"is this in warzone? if so then yes most of the mw blueprints are not there at all, but in mw multiplayer the store items are still there, it suck especially for people who have not bought mw multiplayer, but activision wants to put their good game (mw) down and bring cold war and warzone up"

*Check those corners*
I�m surprised that at least 2 of them couldn�t take you when you were stationary
Nice play.
Why did that last guy push you what an idiot
You didn�t have to reload when you had 15 bullets left that was plenty to get the last two but no one caught you even though you didn�t move and had no suppressor. I�m more impressed that they didn�t shoot you through that bangable wall or at least know you were there honestly
Gun setup?
"Not necessarily a good way to do it but your ads aim should come naturally when practicing with your normal/hip fire sens. There�s also a Reddit page for Kovaaks. r/FPSAimTrainer

3000dpi is pretty high and I don�t know what your sens is at. I tried �high� sens when I first started and it was too inconsistent (close range combat felt impossible). I got a bigger mousepad and play on 800dpi 3.4 sens now and keep my ads and mouse coefficient to default. I made the switch to MKB about a month ago and since lowering my sens my k/d is near my 2 k/d skill level I had on controller. 

It�s all up to preference but that�s what has worked for me."
"Not sure about the zoom multipliers, but mouse sens is all preference. Monitor distance coeffecient should not be changed unless you're switching from 1080P to 1440P.

A good way to find out your mouse sens relative to someone else's sensitivity is by EDPI. To do that, multiply your DPI by your in game sensitivity. For example, I'm on 1800DPI at a 6.5 sensitivity, so my EDPI is 11700. 

Also, you can find your cm/360 using a calculator online. Just search for cm/360 calculator Warzone. In COD, 25-45cm/360 is pretty average. I'm at a 12cm/360, which is way too high for most people. At 3000DPI, I'd assume you're in the same ballpark as me, it might be worthwhile turning your sensitivity down if you're not used to controlling long range tracking with your fingertips.

For ADS multipliers in game, that's all preference. Most people like it around 0.75-0.85, I like mine at just 1 so I can flick more effectively."
"Ah thanks this helps a lot! My edpi is 19,200 and i used to have it at 36,000 which worked fine for me till I started using Kovaaks. Since using Kovaaks I didn�t know there was sensitivity values that I could change so I was playing with something really slow to me, so when I joined in game in wz I got destroyed so bad cuz it felt like 40x faster but this helps a lot! Also just not used to move my whole arm to flick and still figuring out how to hold my mouse properly lol"
Did you spend your cod points in another Cod Game?  I found out the hard way those Cod Points are linked to ALL Call of Duty games.
platform remained the same?
If mean that i changed consoles? No i didn't not change
Did you get your cod points back ?

How do people use the famas? I can�t use that gun to save my life. Nice play by the way
"Small and medium small maps are the best for it. Because if you're using the Famas and expecting to get consistent 1 and 2 burst on larger maps you're dreaming

Also the Famas second firing mode is just one bullet per trigger pull, like the Fal. So if you don't like the burst switch firing modes and use it like a semi auto."
"But 3 people.. isn�t an ace.. you know what, never mind.. you do you buddy"
"Ah ace is where you kill the entire enemy team by yourself. But still, this isn�t that all impressive or an ace."
"You probably clipped them with the bullets, like you said, lag compensation plays a huge role. It�s not your fault but the shitty low tick servers Activision repeatedly use in every COD. 

My advice is to go on HC shipment and hip fire shotties, can literally snipe people with the right attachments."
"Yeah, but I have even had instance of using dead silence, sneaking behind the Longshot spot on shoot house aiming at the guys head and pressing trigger twice. Literally happened like 3 games ago. I just quit to desktop.

Gonna try hc, cause this is starting to drive me mad.

Thansk"
Hardcore shoot the shart is the ticket for shotguns. And just about any gun when one finds themself on the road to Damascus.
Eh how you cant like shotguns were my first guns to get gold
"They just seem very cheesy. Like hip fire while running at people just doesnt appeal to me really. 

I love hopping around the map, either sniping, or using a handgun."
"I play ground war, has little to no SBMM"
"Might have to give it a go, until battlefield 6 :)"
"That isn't a bad k/d. If you are top placing and dominating in each match you play they do get progressively harder. Once you start into the top 5%, or so they seem to become horrible sweat fests."
How high up in the rankings are you?
"Not very high, have 13 days played and a 1.23 k/d so nothing wild, my win/loss and score per min are all stupidly low as well"
haha yeah every shoot house match I get into has the CDL Faze skin kids with SPRs... I just back out of those games just to be put back in the same lobby a minute later
"We just gotta adapt my guy. Play party modes or gunfight/ground war if you don�t wanna adapt to them. All the sweats are on cuz of shoot the ship, most will leave tomorrow when BOCW S2 comes out."
Yeah I guess so
SBMM finally caught up to you.
Pretty much haha
The league is broken about six months. They must get back to patch this game. The new guns are available only on survival
What are you even complaining about? I play MW almost everyday an haven't had any toxic players or lag for that matter. Yeah you get the occasional camping team but that's just cod
I don�t have a camping issue it�s just the way people play. My k/d is quite high so I�m used to playing in decent lobbies but I just can�t play the game now - the way people abuse the meta I just can�t compete in these lobbies anymore
Can the uzi have a tracer please
""" Literal sweat fest 24/7.  ""

Sweats are not campers, so why are you complaining?"

Warzone Lagging Issue

While playing warzone im getting the three page icons in the middle left of my screen.

Stats show no packet loss. 40ms latency.

Tried Wired and Wireless.

Reset router to default.

Opened ports to make nat type open.

Ive replaced cables and had modem replaced still getting lag and those icons

speed test is 460 down 23 up consistantly.

Ive tried another persons network that plays fine and still get lagging issues

ive done a full reset on pc and reinstalled everything. same issue.

tried updating bios, and other drivers. same issue.

tried changing almost all settings in game. same issue.

Reset MoBo bios to default. same issue.

System Specs.

win 10, z390 MoBo, i7-9700k, RTX 2070, 16 Gb 3200mh, 1tb nvme drive

disabled game bar, game mode, nvidia overlay."
"Glad I'm not going crazy. So it is freezing and stuttering for you, not just rubberbanding?"
"I've had 3 squares packet loss for months now. Only really ever happened on Modern Warfare, Cold War works fine. There's not been a fix at all, I have no idea what I'm meant to do about it but it makes playing Warzone pretty bad (so I've avoided it).

Xbox Series X/Xbox One"
Part of me thinks they're sabatoging mw to get people to play cold war.
It's ok it just does that sometimes you just need to close the game completely and reopen it
"It's been doing this for days, restarting the game, restarting pc, no luck. I was recording the issue with geforce experience and when I got one big freeze the recording stopped by itself. [https://youtu.be/BPzZ4l31zzU](https://youtu.be/BPzZ4l31zzU) (note that its still processing so video might take a bit to show up). I took the recording in single player too so I know it's not internet issues."
"It�s from the game, I tried to restart my router/restart my console, to no avail. I don�t remember having these issues at MW launch day."
"had the same issue, moving the game to my ssd fixed it"

They got replaced by the Cold War Prestige progression.
"Like I said, I missed out on just about all of them, but I�m shocked they would do that. I�d have to imagine any player that�s gripped with FOMO would not be pleased that they completely removed their ribbons. Though I suppose they�ll always have the emblems that came with them at least. I had to post this question, I just couldn�t believe they�d actually do that, many of those ribbons weren�t exactly a cake walk.

Thanks for the speedy reply."
Its season 2 according to cod tracker. 3000 points
"I hope so, I've been checking every day for this one. It's so cute."
Wtf 3000 cod points!? What the fuck is in that bundle? That bundle better suck my d*ck for that price.
"They changed the season because they didn�t think it released yet but I�ve already come across people with this skin and the Ronin one. Someone even has a video of them buying it on YouTube a while back. 

All of the new skins since Domino Singularity have been bugged and don�t show for every player. As mentioned below this affected Tacgas, Grinch Lion bundle, Ronin Samurai and until player reports across social media Rozes new bundle. The only ones that haven�t released yet from the December update are Iskra, Soap and Sparks now. 

Hoping they re release Tacgas, Ronin and the Domino rainbow skin now that they�re aware of the bug. But I�m not gonna hold my breath."
Some leaks saying we're getting a content drop March 11th so before or on that day but past that idk...
Source?
"People have been using this skin for about a month now. It was likely released for only few like the Grinch Lion bundle and the Tacgas bundle. 

Roze was the same where only a few peoples saw it until people were complaining about it on Twitter and YouTube and they fixed it later that day. 

Idk how Raven screwed up the store."
I�ve seen the Grinch Lion and TacGas multiple times now. I assumed they had been officially released.
The only Cold war content I would spend money on.
Me too. It's the best one out and the calling card is super cute too.
I�m buying the bundle for that Oden tracer that has been overdue for so long now and the m13
I�ve seen some PC players with it. But it�s because they datamined or something :/
Wow.
"You may have gotten hacked. They dont randomly delete accounts. When you get hacked, everything in your account goes away and you're reset to 1. That includes purchased cosmetics. Activision support handles hacked accounts but there's no guarantee you'll get it back. Check this sub and you'll see how common it is to be hacked. Some people report waiting up to 4-5 months to get the account back. Just depends. Make sure you have proof when you contact Activision."
It's not that the account is reset or anything. The account is gone. I can make a new account using the same email.

"OK.  That made me happy.  I fucking hated that �challenge� and was super tired of people in my office posing for this in different groups.

This has been happening a lot to me lately and seems to have started around the time CW launched.  I do NOT play on WiFi.  The only thing that makes it interesting is the bullets seem to be frozen wherever they were fired and you can find them floating around the map.  So I look at that for a minute before I quit the game."
I have this theory that they changed the way the games get hosted. Like less dedicated server support maybe.
We can hope in future CoDs we will have this feature but we�re not going to be getting it on MW
Cold War has this feature.
It sucks. Even halo is adding it in for consoles on all games.
Halo is adding it but limiting framerates to 60 down from 120 if you go higher than default
"It's probably due to performance issues.

Increasing the FOV means the game has to render in more stuff on the screen at once. It might not have been a performance-viable option on consoles.

At least that's the only reason I can see why it's not there on consoles."
Yeah but you have consoles like the series x or PS5. I feel like they would be able to support a foc slider to an extent
"I have a ps4 pro. 

Before the low performance circlejerk arrives, I'd like to point out that I can use 20x zoom scope on my snipers without performance issues. Dead silence gives you a bit wider fov without issues. I'm not asking to have 120 fov without fps drops, i am asking for an OPTION to use bit higher fov.

Every time these kind of discussions turn into 'devs protecting consumers from themselves'. Basically what Apple does for their consumers."
"20x zoom on snipers requires less performance, not more, as your focus becomes a pinhead of fov instead of a large amount."
"Yes, you have a Ps4 Pro, the Pro will have no issues with the higher FOV, however, its still a ps4, which means that the standard ps4 will also get the FOV slider, and that one is not capable of keeping performance."
this would be amazing
"Interestingly enough, I watched this video yesterday and this guy claims lowering your FOV on PC causes a drop in FPS while increasing your FOV causes an increase in FPS.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAx3BQwrl50&t=467s"
It really does need to happen but not how it happened in cold war were changing it messes up textures
"Consoles have shit hardware and can't handle higher FOVs. If it's not hard to implement and they didn't do it, there must be a reason don't you think?"
What about my ps4 pro?
Cold War has it
There�s benchmarks done to prove this wrong. You can actually gain FPS from increasing FOV as further away objects don�t have to be rendered in as much detail. The worst FPS is at 90 with 120 and 110 being within 1-5 FPS of 80 which is the default FOV.
"If you are on last gen, you won't ever get fov. Just upgrade to next gen and hope they release next gen version for warzone."
Should've gotten it a long ass time ago.
Everyone should like this post and get it notice by the developers
"devs dont care bout this game anymore, now their focusing on cold war, fo mo... M O N E H. Greedy asshats."
Its obviously not difficult to implement considering Cold War has an FOV slider on every console. They're just not interested in implementing it because they're so focused on the next COD and warzone. We'll most likely see it in all future COD titles though.
"Cold war is running on a significantly older engine while also being designed with an FOV in mind. Last generation consoles struggle to run Modern Warfare as it is, nevermind with the additional load from an increased FOV.

I'm sure Cod 2021 will have an FOV for the new consoles, but I'm sceptical of the older ones having it, at least not without some big performance limitations. That's even if it comes to previous generation."
"Unfortunately its not going to happen, its pretty dumb since there's loads of games on console that have a FOV slider. Maybe in next gen they will add one on the next cods."
There is no reason not to let us have a FOV slider if we play on 1080.
Performance.
The console have pre download and pc not have it its pretty balanced

"I�d like a nighttime, sunny and precipitation version of every map I�d think that is really cool and would give people who like nighttime maps more variety. I also really like the rain so rainy and snowy maps would be great to me"
Underpass please!
Loved that map on domination. All the MW2 maps were solid (except rundown)
Petrograd and Cheshire Park kinda have a sunset skybox. I think it would be awesome to have Shoot House or Vacant with the same or darker. Not quite night but dusk.
Not interested in the slightest. Nuketown for example has probably 6 different versions of it with different weather etc. But they are all just nuketown to me and I don't feel any new experience. Same with Christmas Crash.
Yeah that's totally fair. I think that's probably the majority opinion.
"In hardcore, ADS. Although, a bit of both if it�s tactical modes like SnD and Cyber. For core, accuracy/control as it takes a lot more to kill someone."
"As averague player i would say accuracy/control, but i bet a high skill level player would say mobility, and it makes sence, once you have mastered accuracy you can build a high mobility set up to be a harder target to shoot, i take Futives as an example of that"
"On pc, the recoil of almost every gun is really easy to control. So I'd say mobility is way more important. Slide and jump further, camera people harder. I put no stock on almost every weapon and dont struggle with the recoil."
"On console, the recoil of all guns is really difficult to control. so I�d say recoil control is essential, so as Aiming Stability."
"That's on PC though. Controlling recoil with a mouse is way easier, but it's still pretty easy to do on controller. 

Usually I'll warm up in Siege, then my recoil control in COD always feels perfect. Gotta love the reactions when you can beam someone with an AK with no stock and no grip."
I definitely think its accuracy/control
"Depends on the map, but I like balanced usually."
Go as fast as you can make it while still being able to control the recoil at your desired range. I usually lean towards mobility because the recoil in the game feels fairly manageable (Xbox). I use the skeleton stock almost always if it is available as it gives good mobility without the cost of no stock recoil. Some guns need more love than others. The m4 has relatively low recoil while the base Ak not so much. For the m4 I tend not to use no stock but if you get used to controlling the recoil you can still use it a range if you like the movement.
PC player here. For me its a balance of both. I try to do more ADS speed tho. No sights - imo waste of an attachment.
"I try to find the balance between the two, in multiplayer I feel the maps are small enough and the m4a1 is accurate enough that you can lean towards speed.

I also make like three builds and take them into a private match, spray three targets on the wall and test fire them to see the recoil.
I main the famas so I wanted to get that burst as tight as possible without slowing down the gun to the point that I don't even have the chance to fire.

I usually try to have all green bars in the gun Smith unless I'm doing spec ops or large map game mode

Also check out r/codloadouts"
In hardcore ADS/mobility in core accuracy/control.
"Are you on console? I've toyed with the M4 a lot and I've found in multi the best is either grenadier or corvus barrel, strippled, 50 mag, merc foregrip, and 3x sight. You don't need the sight, but I like it for the larger maps. Play around in custom maps and just fire it. The merc can be replaced with commando, but I like the hipfire accuracy. Lasers are good too if you don't hardscope or hold an objective. A lot of guides say no stock, but I've personally found it difficult at range on console."
"Range. Range is what wins you gunfights in this game. Control is just down to the user, aslong as you can control the recoil, it doesn't really matter how much there is."
"I go for mobility with some recoil control usually the commando grip. The M4 is different though I�ve started using no stock, 32 round conversion,  monolithic suppressor, commando grip, and stippled grip. You could try using the 5mw laser instead of the the stippled, and sleight of hand over commando grip though."
"You'll find a lot of the higher tier players build their weapons for more mobility, as accuracy and control are variables that you can control with practice.

If you're not comfortable with the recoil of a weapon, build it for more control. As you get used to the recoil spray, try to make the weapon handle better.

If you like the M4, the most effective builds will usually have no stock and a compensator, with a longer barrel."
"Mobility and positing 100%

The oden is powerful but you can�t get in position to use it."
Ads I personally like a good mix of both.
What is your attachments? Speed is super important to aggressive play.
"[https://truegamedata.com/weapon\_builder.php](https://truegamedata.com/weapon_builder.php)

Check the stats using this rather than the in-game graphs/info."
"That�s actually really helpful, thanks"
Erm. Depends how you play?
Speed
"ADS speed for mobile play, recoil management for sustained fire, combination of the two for more flexibility

Generally most guns are forgiving enough that you can go full ADS speed with attachments with little real downside, but things like the Merc foregrip or longer barrels can make full auto trigger holding more manageable while giving useful other stats

It's always going to come down to how you play and how you generally engage other players"
"best warzone m4 paired w smg:monolithic suppressor,stock M16 grenadier,VLK 3.0,Commando foregrip,60  round mag

Best Warzone M4 paired with sniper:Monolithic suppressor,Stock M16 grenadier,tac laser or stippled grip tape(up to you),Commando foregrip,60 round mags

Best Mp M4:Corvus Custom marksman,G.I Mini reflex,forge tac cqs(stock),commando foregrip,60 round mag.

These are my preferred loadouts,ive the b
obsidian m4 so i think i have the best possible loadouts and in the future ignore the graph in weapon gunsmith."
M4 best is commando grip monolithic m16 stock and a optic or bigger mag or the barrel for more damage and range two of those three if you want speed Jus use a smg
M16 stock destroys your movement speed.
Free bundle are trash anyway
"Sometimes they�re hidden to the right off screen and theres no scroll bar indicating there�s more, try holding the stick to the right on each row and it�s probably just off screen."

Are you doing the veteran or regular difficulty?

"It took me a couple of tries to get it but I finally did, I recommend you use

Primary: M91 with thermal scope and 120 rounds. The rest of the attachments are up to you, but the thermal and 120 is a must. PKM also works nice.

Secondary: Riot shield is quite helpful as it blocks most of the shots, also good for taking out Juggs. Soak up all the dmg from the jugg while your teammates shoot at it  


Perks: EOD, Overkill, Battle Hardened  


Munitions: 2 Juggernauts, Sentry turret  


Most importantly, a good team, communicate with them and you should have this done in no time! Good luck!"
Wait.. what's the thermal for?
i did it on my second try lol
Okay?
"My account got hacked and when I tried to login it said my email and password didn�t exist with my account and had to register again, which reset my whole cod profile whilst someone�s happily playing away on my old account with all my paid skins and camos ect.

"Haters will say it doesn't count, but the mk2 carbine all the way. Stacked ads speed attachments, nvg solozero thermal scope, & sleight of hand."
I�m going to have to disagree with you on this simply because of the re-chamber speed
The dragunov is actually pretty good in ground war if you know how to calculate your shots.
The dragonov is so overpowered people just like to whine about it bc they don�t know how to use it
Ax-50 all the way

You keep everything you unlocked from the previous battle pass but the new one replaces the old and if you buy it you unlock new stuff
"wow really fast reply, haha. cheers"
"When timer runs out that's it, you can't progress anymore anything you've unlocked is yours, anything you missed out on will no longer be available for you to obtain.

A new Season 2 battlepass will release after a few hours."
"The battle pass renews every season with new characters, customables and blue prints"
Iv never bought the battle pass. Didn�t seem like there�s any real benefit. What an I missing out on?
"Timer usually hits 0s and stays that way for a few hours 

Once the new update hits on Thursday, the season 2 pass will be added and replace the old one. You can still complete missions for operator skins from the pass and stuff, but you can't unlock any extra tiers that you didn't reach"
Someone needs to get the FTC to file a complaint against them. The FTC has the power under section 5 to go after companies for unfair practices when they fail to maintain adequate data security measures.
"Bro - try logging in using one of the services you linked to it. They can't remove all of them. I ripped mine back off the hacker by accessing it via Steam and then flipping my details back. Once you've regained control, AV support can relink you."
its pretty funny that people still seem to think big corporations actually care about their player/customer base
"I don�t really expect them to care, but I do expect them to take responsibility when an account is hacked due to a data breach that is more than likely on their end."
"it's not even that, there are plenty of other big companies that actually have coherent customer service representatives/systems in place to help the customer. 

although, you're right. You shouldn't expect Activision to have good customer service when they've already demonstrated through game releases time and time again that they are completely anti-consumer. Having yearly releases with terrible balance, no support for past games after a year, overcharging with microtransactions (at this point let's call them macrotransactions), etc. 

Activision is the epitome of Anti-consumer."
"Man, I genuinely feel your pain, as I'm [in the same situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lqu9r8/psa_record_your_activision_id_now_like_right_now/). I will say, my chat with them was a little more positive, and the guy seemed really willing to help. Mentioned that having the original Activision ID would help a ton, but that he was confident they would be able to restore my account (unless he was just trying to placate me), and that he couldn't speed the process up at all. I even told them that the impostor was inviting my friends into games, telling them that I was wasn't around anymore. Now, this isn't an issue for friends I talk to all the time, but for friends I don't play with as much? Yeah, high chance they're gonna' severe their ties with me, which is the most frustrating thing. The rep told me he would add it to the case notes.

I certainly hope there's the possibility that you'll get this resolved soon, and you're certainly not alone in your situation, just know that. What really infuriates me is that they allow the person to change the e-mail and password in one step on the site, and never send out an e-mail link to confirm the changes, etc., outside of basically saying ""FYI, your password was changed. If this wasn't you, well.. too bad, here's the recovery form.""

Like.. what!?"

Did you have 2FA enabled?
"No because I really didn�t expect this to happen, I didn�t know someone could just steal my whole account by going on the activision website when I�m on PS4."
"Just changed my password, thanks for the heads up"
If you don�t have 2fa you�re asking for it at this point
"I had my acct hacked 12/7 and tried recovery process, got an email a week later that it�ll take longer. In early Jan reached out on Twitter, after 3 weeks got a generic response. Finally on 2/16, almost 2.5 months later, filed a complaint with better business bureau. I included email receipts that I had purchased COD stuff on that acct, what my previous tag was, and what the new owner had changed the activision name to (was still logged in on the mobile app). Within 12 hours my account was recovered and restored. So id try the recovery process then file with BBB at least"
Why didn�t you just use two factor authentication?
feel bad for you hope you can recover it
The battle pass is for cold war and warzone. You can't use it in modern warfare.
[deleted]
Wait you already have access to the S2 battle pass? (posting Wednesday)
No i just got to tear 100 in season 1 so i thought i might as well buy it.
Because you bought a battle pass thats only for Cold War and Warzone. Cant use it in regular multiplayer. There have been so many posts about this. Make sure you read it thoroughly. The next battlepass will most likely be the same way too.
"If it's rebirth, there's a glitch where one person can't respawn and is classed as spect so he's not dying to gas, but also still in game.  In the end wins the game."

"All of those operator missions from season 1 (as in, early 2020/end 2019) are bugged, you are not supposed to see them unless you bought the battle pass for that season"

You can't level them up the game most likely got bugged to show these.

"Same. I really hope this is just a problem I have (and a few others will obviously have it) because if everyone has it, people will start running shields on their backs more often."
damn and im complaining about shooting uavs down 300 times
By the same logic team kills would count towards camos.
"I mean ... 
Technically it would be true"

"That would only encourage griefing and people who would screw over your killstreaks. Not to mention you didn't actually earn the kill by taking down a friendly killstreak or teammate (because they can call it in if you simply asked). No thats just a dumb idea all around. And to answer the question, no it doesn't work and it doesn't count when you team kill either. Just play the game normally."
"I think that would cause too many problems if you were able to shoot down allied killstreaks. Allied intel killstreaks (UAVs, PRs, CUAVs, etc) don't even actually appear in the sky as far as I know... If you see a UAV in the sky, it'll always be enemy controlled.

&#x200B;

I just got Damascus in January... **Here's my advice**.

A lot of people online say Ground War is bad for getting Launcher progress, I say that's a lie. When I was grinding, I found that I was almost always getting progress on Killstreak and Vehicle-based challenges each match, almost guaranteed. You just have to really pay attention.

First get all of your Launcher kills in Hardcore Shoot the Ship, then go into Ground War. The things to look out for are *any* player-operated ground vehicle, VTOL jets, Personal Radars, UAVs\* and Counter-UAVs.

*\*(With some practice and watching YouTube video demonstrations, you can shoot down UAVs with the Strela and the RPG despite the lack of lock on capability.)*

Equip the Spotter perk and Cold-Blooded. Equip Munitions Boxes to replenish 1 rocket. VTOL jets are easy prey for free-fire rockets, especially for the RPG-7. That weapon in particular requires only 3 rockets to fully down a VTOL. Also, turn on subtitles and *really* pay attention to the announcer voices. Listen for ""Enemy UAV overhead"", ""Enemy VTOL"", etc etc. Personal Radars are NOT announced by the announcer in Ground War, but with the Spotter perk they will show up on your map and be visible via a red outline through walls.

Tanks are good for Splinter camo. Try your best to interpret where enemy tank drivers are travelling to, and be at that objective before they get there so you can surprise them with rockets. Hitting tanks from the rear results in a critical hit, dealing more damage. Disabling a tank will result in it eventually exploding, counting towards your progress.

&#x200B;

Some Ground War maps I found the most success on:

**Karst River Quarry** *(lots of cover to quickly run through the map, pursuing vehicles and getting closer to Air streaks for a clean shot.)*

**Krovnik Farmland** *(sticking around the B, C, and D objectives, I was able to shoot down lots of VTOLs and destroy many tanks)*

**Verdansk International Airport** *(sticking to the C objective and staying on the roof, I was able to target many tanks as the C objective is a popular spot for tanks to rush and VTOLs to be called in overhead.)*

**Verdansk Riverside** *(this map fucking sucks in my opinion but it's a small enough map where you should be able to target Personal Radars with lock-on weapons effectively. But a small map means high player density, so when you're trying to get closer to PRs with non-lock-on weapons like the RPG, often times you'll just get killed which is frustrating.)*

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long winded response but I feel like I was able to really perfect my craft when it comes to getting Plat launchers, so to speak. Wishing you the best of luck, YOU CAN DO THIS! Launchers was perhaps the most tedious of the Damascus grind, but it is still achievable!

&#x200B;

P.S. I've permanently switched from the UAV to the Personal Radar to make the Damascus grind for people like you just *a little bit easier.* Hopefully we'll match up so you can farm my radar drones for progress lol"
"Thanks 
I will try it but I personally don't like ground war that much"
shotguns work
Yup. Works on slide cancellers too. Just shoot where they're going to be not where you think they are. Job done. Don't even need DB rounds.
But but everyone hates shotgun :(
"I guess, but I feel cheap using them (especially fire rounds). Guess I�ll have to make �take a shower u sweat� class and see how it works out, thanks!"
"Usually they are rather easy to counter, given you have sufficient skill. I personally don't have any problem with those techniques (i have a 4.26kd and 3.6 w/l), so let me just share a couple of options with you:

1. Use his Bunnyhop to your advantage.

This depends a lot on how skilled the enemy is and what gun he uses, but generally he will tac sprint before the bunnyhop, which gives you somewhere between 150-300ms of sprintout time, where you can shoot, but he can't. As long as you are able to hit your shots and track him, you have a very good chance of killing him. If you have a hard time tracking, make sure you have a high enough sensitivity (or at least ADS sensitivity)

2. Bait

You know he's coming? Great, let him jump into empty space and after he wasted his movement, just pop out and kill him. Don't just stand there, be less predictable and let him expose himself to a bad position while you obtain a better one

3. Your own movement

Usually the techniques have some little weakspots and shortcomings. For example Dropshots make you very immobile and slow to turn, so fast movements work well against it. Bunnyhops are generally done with a direction in mind, so a well placed slide towards him can mess up whatever plan he had pretty good

4. Positioning

More of a general tip - be mindful of your positioning on the map, where the enemies are, what lines of sight exist on you, where your teammates are, etc. If you have good awareness, you can try to put yourself in advantageous situations or just avoid that guy if you don't feel confident in facing him"
"Thanks for the in-depth tips, appreciate it! Yeah I usually try and bait them and always try to keep some cover between me and the enemy. I guess I should work on movement and positioning more, well guess it�s time for some hardcore"
"Another tip for positioning: People generally will slide/bhop around corners, position yourself so they won't see you until the end of their slide/bhop. At that point they'll be unable to get out of the way and you'll have the advantage in the gunfight"
"Do the same thing, if you can�t beat them join them, also jumping and spinning around a corner always works, also turn on auto tac sprint"
"TAC Sprint kills spring to fire though, no point if I can�t shoot fast enough. There should be another way to beat em besides joining them. Im gonna try timing my slides right to throw off their aim, thanks for the advice man!"
Frangible disabling.
Playing a semi realistic shooter where everyone is sliding 24/7/365 from match start to end is really offputting... Different if it was Halo or some shit... Bugs me when something is kinda realistic in some way then there's that or anime bullets and stuff.
COD isn't realistic at all.
It's truthfully a 50/50 chance to win. Pre-aim almost every corner. It is unfortunate that the devs are so incompetent with the game. Makes no sense how you can jump and aim perfectly. Those people are just exploiting a flaw in the design of the game. So sad.
Cold War put penalties on jumping and dropshotting idk why the fuck MW doesn't follow suit. Should totally be a ADS and accuracy penalty for both.
"I win maybe 10% of the time if I�m being generous, and that�s with a years luck on my side. Yeah it�s a crucial flaw that should�ve been fixed during its life cycle. Here�s hoping that they fix it in MW2 along with team balancing (god I hate carrying noobs all the time)."
"Slowing walking around a corner is why you die, run and jump and do a small spin and you should kill them"
"Like buddy said, that will put me at a disadvantage due to lag compensation. We have to blitz around the corners to have a fair chance at winning the gunfight. 

I completely agree with the no downside to jumping and aiming, very bad decision on the devs part. I propose that they significantly nerf the accuracy while in the air and add a short movement delay upon landing (akin to infected after using a throwing knife). Either that or remove the ability to add when jumping or sliding."
"Lol its not an oversight or a flaw, its CoD. youve been able to jump and drop shot in CoD since at least the original MW. Even MW2 had b-hopping. 

Theres plenty of slower paced fps games out there, alot of people enjoy the speed of CoD."
That guy is deaf
"Just to be clear, that guy had been in that corner everytime I passed through."
Yeah over time you learn to throw nades on these spots w/o even looking at them.
camp = trash
That's why I did a finishing move instead of just killing him with a gun. I know campers suck
The fuck outta here
*geh verdammt raus*
I wish I had this game..
so buy it
wish i got the thrown knife dlc when they came out

"Lmao rip, activision support took me 3 months for a reply, sorry man good luck"
Play hardcore
"You should play hardcore always, but definitely for handguns."
"Just go to hard core...? Also close quarters, it's barely 2 shots to the head"
Hardcore shoot the ship
Hardcore Shoot The Ship.
Hardcore with a riot shield on your back and rush tactics to get into 1shot kill range. If you don�t rage easily shoot the ship on HC is the best. I found pistols to be the easiest to complete (got Damascus twice in ~11 days total game time) best of luck bro
Hardcore. The 1911 is a beast on hardcore. Just kit it out for speed/mobility and you'll still one shot for decent range before it drops to 2 shot
Hardcore Shoot The Ship!!!!!!
"First play hardcore mode, preferably with an objective based match like hard point.  Depending on what you�re grinding equip the akimbo or sleight of hand.  

Set it up with the longest range barrel and light trigger.  I usually added grip tape for accuracy.  If you can add a sight that helped my long shots and headshots, but that can be exchanged for larger clips if you prefer.

Hope that helps."
"It did help me, thank you for the detailed reply."
"There is no ""silver"". There is Gold, Platinum, Damascus, and Obsidian."
"I got Damascus in January, here's my advice:

&#x200B;

If you're going to do some camo grinding, set aside your mode preference and understand that the Shoot the Ship playlist is your best friend. I guarantee that you will spend significantly less time on your camo grind this way and you'll get it out of the way so much quicker.

The player density of Shipment means you'll get kills extremely rapidly. If you die, the spawns are so busted that you spawn right back in the fight, and you might as well not have died in the first place. Reptile camos require 75 kills with no attachments, if you average 30 kills in 1 Shipment match you can see how quickly you'll breeze through it.

Shoothouse is good for getting your Longshots / Mounted Kills in tandem with each other by camping mid. It's not a gracious process, but it gets the job done. For pistols, however, you can score Longshot medals on Shipment, so no need to bother with Shoothouse. You need to stand as far back as you can though, shooting at people on the other side of the map. 

&#x200B;

And as with what others have said, if the killing power of the weapon you are using is just not enough, you can also load into the Hardcore variant of Shoot the Ship. But personally, I found Core Shipment to be so chaotic that I was able to reliably get lots of kills even with the worst weapons grinding no attachment kills lol.

&#x200B;

Hope I could help, best of luck to you! I'm not sure if you're going for Damascus, but if you *are,* know that I have permanently swapped out my UAV for the Personal Radar so I can help people like you get through their Launchers quicker hahahaha"
"The 1911 is the worst handgun in the game hands down. Go Hardcore with it so it's actually worth something. The RoF is trash, the damage is trash, the velocity is trash. It's basically a gutted Desert Eagle."
"Premium bundle exist

IW: must include 1911"
Hardcore tdm? Or just get better
"A good way maybe run akimbo, turn a corner after reload, jump into crouch for kills.  You shoot both at the same time so more dmg on target, and you knock out crouch, after reload, hip fire, with all attachments, and maybe double/3 kills without death at once.  You need gold on all reg pistols to get silver on all pistols, which is everything except for renetti."
I got gold for the deagle and i just played hardcore. It was kinda insane ngl
"You know it's a 1tap to upper torso and head in core right?, Using stopping power with it gives it a 1shot almost every where on the body"
"Shoot the ship man, go on hardcore and it�s basically always a one hit"
"You can 1v1 right now.
The playlist is going away tomorrow so make the most of it."
"play HC shoot the ship gg ez. if do it when its gone, HC dom"
"Hardcore, or Realism Ground War.  


Realism ground war makes all pistols OHK headshots, atleast at every range I could test it on (I got a 150m OHK headshot with an X16, so I'm gonna assume all ranges.) Good for longshots, etc."
hardcore shipment
The song + blanket & pillow edit made me laugh more than it should have haha
Lmao why did I think the blanket and pillow were part of the execution xD
"Hahahahaha the song started off with ""puuuuuuuuuut your head on the pillow"" too perfect"
lol i was surprised
"Outsmarting riot shields is one of the easiest things you can do when you aren't panicking, too bad everyone always panics"
"Step 1: Thermite.
Step 2: Watch em buuuurn."
Ah man. You know one time in WZ I saw riot shield didn�t panic threw a Semtex. Stuck him he runs at me..... I panicked then.
"Claymore works great too - put it between you and them. They either have to remove the riot shield to shoot at it (so you shoot), walk around it (shoot with an angle), or walk on it (die - edit:because he has to crouch walk to avoid damage meaning he's moving ultra slow and very easy to jump around and shoot)."
"It's so easy lol. If anything it's hard to use a riot shield consistently, you go through a meatgrinder if the other team is competent"
"I mean, getting good and actually countering shields is easy. But complaining on the internet that shields are broken is even easier!"
My opponent panicking is key to my Riot Shield Strategy.
"The worst thing about riot shield is latency because even if you're facing them on your screen their screen will take priority and they'll kill you from behind/side. This is obviously most applicable to close range.

Riot shield is always fun because most people just panic though even though it's been a mainstay since mw2"
"You can panic and suceed, what you mean is chocking"
Arguably 90% of Shield users are unaware of their surroundings lol
Whenever I see a no camo riot shield I give them kills. I went through the pain of getting it gold so I know what its like.
Obsidian riot shield gang.
"Usually, I just rush and jumpshot riot shields. They're usually too busy crouching to realize that's what you're about to do. I don't have the mental capacity to do something like this."
I don't have the mental capacity to jump and shoot.
So are those guys that use shorty 725 and then proceed to call everybody trash
Yeah that�s ridiculously easy to counter. If you run at me I stand up and whack you with it. Riot shield is the best weapon in the game if you know how to use it
"The song says ""Put your head on the pillow"" in Arabic. Lol"
That makes it even better lol!
made me dead
"[this is the song for whoever�s wondering ](https://youtu.be/QqJ9zrY_ITw)

Also,nice clip OP"
So wholesome
Fucking people that use riot shields are not loved by their mothers.
"If the riot shield is gold/plat/Damascus then I won�t pull punches. If it�s someone with some low-tier shield skin on Shipment, 90% of the time I�ll feed �em kills the whole match, to make their grind easier!"
I mainly use guns but the community are bitches when it comes to riot shields. So easy to counter and playing melee only on search is hard af. Riot shield makes it easier
I liken my use of a riot shield to Draymond Green. Everyone hates him until he�s on your team.
Salt makes things tastier.
"Fucking people that don�t use the meta and take the game Uber seriously aren�t loved by their mothers* 

riot shields are fun to use, chill out"
Its refreshing to be killed by a riot shield sometimes after dying to the same smgs over and over
They have moms?
Was hearing that a lot during damascus grinding lol. Fun days. I made some shield friends too haha.
yeah
"Nah, it�s fun to fuck around with shields in search every now and then. Problem is every time the shield gets whipped out the other team goes full MLG with thermites, molotovs, and semtex. No one ever plays along"
Wait Kuwaiti�s are on Reddit?
Mshallah!!!1!!111!
Please can someone reply
"Dude this is beyond despicable, this teammate is a F**got"
Yeah i agree. It sucks. I cant even do anything
"You reported him because he knifed you? That isn�t an exploit, he killed you. Everyone was trying to kill you and they did, you got a normal jug time where the enemy actually tries to kill you."
It wasnt an enemy. That was a friendly that repeatedly stabbed me as soon as i got the jug that jug would have easily lasted the whole game
"Ummm.. they release cod mw 2019(it was awesome at first). Then warzone happened & the hackers came(game starts plummeting downhill). As it�s about to crash & burn, they release Cold War(Worst cod ever) & it ruins warzone AGAIN. So bad that it killed a game released a full year earlier. Now we�re here.. waiting for the guys who made advanced warfare to release a game this year. The end."
Best summery I have ever read
"Yeah I was there for the Warzone drop, but I held through and kind of had fun with it. Buddy of mine gave me a code for CW and I have plenty of issues with it. I can only play it for the zombies."
"Game is on life support or abandoned. They are focused on the Cold War trash, and using Modern Warfare to advertise it night and day because nobody wants to play that shite.

Also, Warzone is cancer to the Call of Duty franchise."
"Yeah I noticed that when I logged into MW for the first after so long, WTF is wrong with Activision if they think advertising CW all over MW is gonna be an okay choice to make? I legitimately couldn't find it when looking at first because I didn't know the little title card was changed from the guy in blue to fucking Stitch."
"Im with you bud, billion dollar company with zero fucks. I get no assist at all still, on Xbox One"
"And sometimes i still lose voice chat on xbox, whats new"
I haven�t noticed anything but I�ve also only been playing shipment so nothing long rang I suppose
Have you tried different AA settings to see if those works at those ranges?
Still can't hit long range or mid range without it moving off target.
Imagine using aim assist
Imagin playing the game as it is intended
You are really not cool for saying that
Hahahahaha
Did anything happen?
I�ve got a kill by rocking a claymore in the Gulag.  Nothing happened. But the winner of that match was my team mate. So.  Yay I guess.
The other guy won the Gulag match
Wow nice throw lmao
"okay what!!

they imprisoned you and let your knife be with you?"
"Rock does 1hp damage.

Guy got shot for 99hp damage by other gulagger.

Commence air-to-surface rock."
"I see countless people with these great looking symbols ranging from Umbrellas to Stars in their clan tag. But obviously when trying to simply input one into your clan tag, it just states �Illegal characters�. Does someone have a workaround for this? I�ve been asking people for months and I�ve never gotten an answer. Does it require PC? A program? Anything? Thank you for your time."
"Given that it is mindless fun and season two is coming, they will 100% delete STS. I mean fuck player happiness right? Pretty sure that is their customer service model."
haha can�t wait to spend 8 minutes backing out of the same Azhir Cave lobby multiple times until it forces me into a Piccadilly or Grazna Raid.
[deleted]
and shipment
I reckon it'll go. They'll want people playing the new warzone and cold war update
Probably
"Wait, can I actually unlock gold, silver, for the handguns class?"
yes. and the challenges are extremely easy compared to all the other weapons
Hopefully they�ll add shipment 24/7
"You're missing the fact that a new hardware automatically gives you easier lobbies for a certain time.

Play the game a few weeks and it will change."
"I switched from console to pc a few months back, but still use a controller and I've gotten very similar lobbies to what I did on PS4 from the first day of switching in MW.  In CW I've only played on PC but get mostly console lobbies there too."
"Well thank you for that and I didn't know that.  
However, both of the consoles are for the very least a month old so I guess it isn't that?"
Wow nice flex
"You're just playing low skill lobbies. If i turn off crossplay on PC i get the same experience, it's just biological recruit bots with 2 left hands

Overall, i can't see any significant skill gap between pc and console whatsoever. Most players on either platform are really bad and once you get near the top, there are some insanely skilled console players."
"exactly.  people way underestimate how much sbmm is going to influence who you see.

&#x200B;

people talk like console players are clueless, idk, the ones i see on cross play are beaming people while jumping corners the same as anyone else in my lobbies."
"People downvote you but it's true.  M/K player lobbies are vastly diff than console lobbies, but only to a certain extent.  If you're a bad player on M/K you're still going to be put with bad players on console.  

People might not like this thread but it's been what controller player been complaining about for a long time, they dont want crossplay with PC players 1 b/c hacks, and 2 b/c they dont want to play against ""cracked PC players"".  I've that complaint about the imbalance on here since like S0.  

Honestly even hooking up a controller on PC made the lobby easier imo when I was trying it out on PC after watching jgod's aim assist being broken video.  The MM takes your input into account as well."
"Honestly, 99% of kbm players are just bad. It's a rarity to see any ""cracked pc players"" to the point that i actually see more ""cracked console players"""
"Play a for a while, then you'll start to get super sweaty lobbies and violently salty PS4/5 lobbies. It's SBMM, it gets harder the better you do."
[removed]
Is this idiot not banned yet? What a site
Use the store button on the weapon you are interested in you dont have to wait on the shop.
"the only thing is it doesn�t include a weapon, only an emblem, calling card, charm and sticker"
Not every bundle is shown sadly. Some are only available when the store rotates.
Can the uzi have a tracer please
U forgot the barrel attachment. Slap on a corvus custom and u should be getting the challenge done
"I thought it meant a muzzle attachment at the end of the barrel oops lol, thanks. Im slow sometimes"
Mongoose shot was impressive. Very nice
This game is great with sounds
Infinity-ward had some pretty great sounds for th the og MW and Mw2
Might make this my notification tone.
The Kar98 probably is the most satisfying weapon to get kills with. Plus it has the perfect amount of mobility where I don't feel sluggish even with all the range attatchments
Way more satisfying before the ads buff. That Rytec is the best sounding gun in my opinion. When I don�t down or insta-kill someone in one shot I keep so bummed cause that gun sounds brutal
I personally prefer the HDR but the Kar98 is a very close second
"Reminds me of the bf1 sound, so satisfying to hear the shot, then that clang"
"Hmmm I prefer the unsupressed desert eagle OR the .357, it�s such a beautiful sound"
"The KAR takes second place in my top 5 favorite weapons in Modern Warfare. Everything is just perfect!

Noooice sniping mate!"
They are not gonna add these to mw2019 but they might add it in the sequel.
Highrise would be sick.
"They actually advertised Terminal. I expected Highrise as well but then the Warzone cancer happened and the Cold War game was out which is truly bad and awful.

I have been playing Call of Duty games ever since the first Call of Duty (WW2) and I'ver never seen so many players stay in the previous title or return to it instead of moving to the new one.

I normally like Black Ops games, I enjoyed Black Ops 2 a lot. But Cold War feels really bad to me. The movement, the sound, the weapons, it all feels so bad and poor. I will never understand how anybody can like it."
fix the weapon unlocks so i either get to use my makarov or remove the green squares from my inventory
Never paid attention. It's not abnormal though. Shadow Company characters have the trail effect hardcore. Nothing to worry about though.
"I've had that before, I thought it was an issue with my pc, but apparently not. I only really noticed it yesterday. I think it's probably to do with the area they're walking through, maybe the lighting is buggy or something? Idk."
It started back when they added all the CW bs. I noticed it right away and mentioned it to my friend.
If you�re playing with ray tracing enabled it�s a bleeding effect from the game trying to decide how to fill those areas
RT is off in settings. Unless it's always on in the main menu...
"TBH, There is same thing that is going on in CP2077, but that was confirmed to be caused by screen space reflections. Tried that off  in this title, same.  Ohh well, if its just the part of the engine, who cares."
Here's the fix: Change ambient occlusion from Both to MDAO
Me and my wife played it every night with no crashes until the update and now we are lucky to play a match without it crashing on the loading screen
"Really need this to be fixed, me and my partner used to play split screen multiplayer every night and now we can�t. So frustrating, we have managed two matches since this bug has appeared. This is on Xbox Series X for us. I have put a ticket in but no response so far"
"same for my wife and I... we can get a couple games in, then it crashes. We did the recent update hoping it would fix, but it still crashes just as frequently"
May we please have a tracer for the uzi some cool that turn you into bones when you get hit
Yes same here ever since the last update. After multiple attempts we can finally get into a game. And then it will still boot you out after a few games. Sometimes it even happens mid game.
"Finally got through, played one game then kicked back to home screen. Super weak shit."
May we please have a tracer for the uzi some cool that turn you into bones when you get hit
Are you lost little buddy?
Kali Sticks are so much fun. The first melee weapon I got gold. The shield is left to get platinum (._. )
"Good luck! I always let riot shield users get a few kills if I�m on shipment, the shield and launchers is what puts me off going for Damascus."
Kali sticks on shipment is so much fun. You almost always get play of the game lol
Yeah it�s brill. The death mic�s are always fun as well.
"I feel like the feeling someone would get when they are awarded obsidian kali sticks is the equivalent feeling of being awarded a participation award.

you didnt put in much effort, and other players are way better than you. but good job at showing up. heres a skin for your frittata sticks."
Found the guy that got kali sticked
"> you didnt put in much effort, and other players are way better than you. but good job at showing up. heres a skin for your frittata sticks.

And somehow it's different for reg guns that's much more powerful less effort and can be done easily without shipment?

I have all melee, launchers and most ARs and SMGs obsidian, couple snipers xbow and kar.  Melee actually took effort.  But it's not like it's hard.  It is a participation medal, but reg guns even more so."
"Well certainly turn off motion blur if you haven�t already... might not be the trick you�re looking for, but that definitely helped me"
big help
"Yeah turn off motion blur. Increase sensitivity gradually over time. If you use a controller, turn off vibration. Next would be experience. Learn the maps, routes, ways in and out. Stay away from.high damage guns. Go for accuracy and minimal recoil. Use a mic, work with your team, and learn your call out locations without looking at map."
"My advice would be to not hide. If you see someone, go engage them. I used to camp a lot and was afraid to rush people, but it�s better to rush them than they rush you imo. Watch your corners, and utilize your recons, bounties, and UAV�s."
I think he means MW�s multiplayer and not WZ
"Just don�t be scared to actually play. I see soo many scared players hiding in a corner. 
Like How is that even fun??"
https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/kw8vap/im_tied_of_being_in_peoples_montages/gj37ee2/?context=3
"the only thing that really works is repetition, just keep playing and be consistent with it. it is all about the muscle memory. the moment you get to know the maps a bit and the guns you WILL improve a lot. and like the other said, do not be afraid to take shots or die just go for them even if you are not sure you are going to hit them."
Play both core and hardcore. They are slightly different skill sets. Try to get your weapons gold. It will teach you different playstyles.
"For starters, just get some practice in and stand up to challenges. If you see good/better players, don't just ragequit, but try to adjust how you play to beat them.

Once you've really gotten the basics down, you can look for the finer nuances that would turn a good player into a great one"
I would suggest aim trainers.practiced my aim and have one of the best in my friends list.also work on your movement try practice slide canceling if you can and jump around corners and aim if you know someone is there.
"Study your opponent, I always try to watch the kill cam feed to see what I could�ve done better in that situation."
"White Phosphorous is bae. Not only keep enemies off objectives, can basically cut off entire lanes of the map or just make a single lane completely inaccessible to the enemy. The actual smoke effect shouldn't have been nerfed in my opinion (I remember it lasting much longer earlier on) and to balance they could've just had it not affect the entire map on Ground War (I know this is where most of the complaints of it came from)"
Also the smoke should be more transparent for you and your allies while significantly obscuring enemy vision to make it actually more a benefit for your teammates than an annoyance. IMO
Except when your idiot teammates will not cap objectives and you are unable to get anywhere near them without catching on fire.
"you are using the CUAV wrong, you have to put it in a corner of the map, as far as possible from the enemy. the effect of the CUAV is map-wide so no matter where you place it, it will work"
"Tbh your giving the air strike a bad wrap, I personally think it�s really good for obj clearing and just al round kills and unlike the cluster strike you can�t it appear on the radar and let�s be honest people are too stupid to hear �enemy airstrike inbound� and actually think to move"
"Funny how i use your S tier killstreaks in the shoot the ship playlist and always decimate the enemy team. Even funnier when the gamemode is grind and I switch to point man. if ever shoot the ship is taken out i always use UAV, Vtol and White Phosphorus. I do however use the IAV from time to time when the map is Arklov Peak and Grazna Raid especially in 10v10 modes lol"
I use VTOL-chopper-AC-130
Agree on like everything lol
"The secret to the juggernaut is to pair it with the Advanced UAV. You use the Advanced UAV at 12 kills which helps you a lot in getting those 3 remaining kills for the juggernaut, and ideally you do it fast enough so you still have it up to help you call in the juggernaut in a safe spot without any enemies trying to steal it.

I used to never run the juggernaut (primarily because it can be stolen), but ever since I tried that combination it's one my go to's (and it never got stolen from me, not once)."
Lets be real we all use the juggernaut solely for the toggle music option.
imo the jug is A tier after they integrated some aspects from jug Royale like driving vehicles and becoming a human predator missile
Nothing like getting a Juggernaut or Gunship out of a care package. Sure to set off any rage-prone enemy players
Nothing like stealing jugalug from someone else's care package.
Honestly I never used a shield turret till I used it today for a blue print mission to get 25 kills with it and I went on to 5 kill runs with it was fun but deff wouldn�t use it again If it were not for a challenge haha
Oh look 2019 called it wants its pointless rant back
Sweat
"Your one of the very few the game has problems just like any game. but this is the best cod Sence the cod4,waw, mw2 days hands down. If you don�t like it then go play fortnite or roblox and leave this one for the big boys to play."
"Hahahahaha not sure what�s adult about sitting in a corner for the whole game. I actually had more fun playing ghosts and I thought that was the worse COD, til now."
I think you spelled man wrong
"Wait... you bought a game, after the release of 7 seasons plus a new title, and found that the players on it are camping? Is this your second COD ever or what..."
"I thought the campers had moved on, I was very wrong."
U forgot to put the /s at the end
"Not at all, it looks good but just too campy for me. Nothing fun about sitting on the side of the map til someone finally walks by."
Try out bf4 it's modern if someone is camping ram the building with a tank
Hahahaha that does sound like fun.
""" I�ve been playing BO4 this whole time""

you are the problem.

You like arena shooters (Overwatch, Paladins)"
Are you on drugs or need to be?
"I wish to be. 
Seriously tho its the truth. Thats what i  think its happening what do you think?"
"First of all it's people like you that makes it so there a new game every year. If you buy their new trash every year why would they stop the yearly cycle?

Second of all if they want to stop suporting it it should be removed from the market. They make people believe the game is still worth full price but in reality it should be free."
I enjoy both games i love both mw and cold war nothing wrong in that. If you think cold war is trash thats up to you. Doesnt mean that everyone hates it
Are you playing against bots?
"Got the same issue, game crashing sometimes when playing split screen on Xbox One, I guess it�s going to take long time to be fixed, split screen on MW2019 is far from being a priority...
My only solution so far is to restart the console and it holds 2-3 games before crashing again"
I could only play 1 game before it consistently kicks me out.
Love how everyone always dies during their Damascus unlock lmao
Yeah never understood the whole shooting in the air in circles shit lmao
"I mean, objective complete. Who cares what happens after?"
GG now time to unlock dark matter
"Nah. I don�t like Cold War much. I�d go for dark aether, but not dark matter. I only like the zombies mode."
"[here�s my stats if anyone wants them](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/profile/xbl/YaB0I%20Ethan/mp)

I mean he could�ve had a really good headset and heard your footsteps and shot where he heard them? But walking up the stairs clearly aimed at where you are yeah I�d say that�s cheating. And the sniper shot could�ve just been a really good shot. I�d say he�s a cheater all day long
"I was thinking either a good gaming chair or wall hack, but who knows!"
Just a little bit. xD
Didn�t even try to hide it and attempted to shoot me through the ceiling lol
WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!!!!!
Seems like cheating.
"It's cheating. I was willing to give the guy the benefit of the doubt because he didn't hit you through the ceiling and wasn't on point, but then the last movement on you shortly before you became visible when he started shooting..."
"Agreed, I made sure to watch the kill cam fully before deciding to report"
For SURE cheating lmao
"Not only did he aim through the floor knowing exactly where you were, but followed you through the wall AND to top it all off, has a default skin."
Everything he does can be explained except for the shooting through floor part. I would wager cheater.
He clearly heard your footsteps and just walked upstairs. I mean there's only two floors to that house. So hearing footsteps directly above you can mean that they're only in one location. You just aim at that location as you go up the stairs. If this is sus then like 80% of my kills are sus in warzone. Because I sound whore all the time just like that.
He literally tried to shoot me through the floor and tracked my movements through a wall...
Fuck them. You keep your calling card like a badass motherfucker. Those guys are just insecure idiots
yo fuck that don�t ever remove your pride calling card cuz of other people. i leave that shit up for everyone to see this way when i win & they start shittalking at the end i can say yup you just got shit on by the gay kid how�s that make you feel. shuts them up every single time.
Imagine shit talking by calling yourself gayee lol
It would be nice if the devs were still active in this sub and would ban people like these for hate speech
They are based
Unironically still uses 4chan
I use the asexual flag calling card and I get stuff like this a lot. I just don't use game chat cause I'm not playing cod to get insulted 24/7.
I�m sorry they were homophobic to you
"JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR, these guys absolutely DO NOT represent the majority of the COD community, I was playing gunfight for hours and only realised here that I still had it on, literally everyone else we ran into was either cool or just friendly banter."
When you have to make your sexual orientation an issue in a computer game where it doesn't belong.
When you care so much what other people are doing in their bedroom you go out of your way to berate them. Fuck outta here.
Technically it does belong since it's a fucking calling card added by the developers but ok?
As if I don�t hate Piccadilly enough and got people like this smashing through dudes with a sniper 360 no scope nut in your face type shit
haha:D:D
Sick af bro. Shit i can only dream of sniping like that
"ty bro, just keep grinding and try to focus on only one sniper. i only play with the AX50 and have now 30000 kills with it:D

It�s just crazy how much better than Cold War this game looks.
"yes, cw is so bad"
"This skin fire, real or not"
"ngl I have all operators on shuffle. Skins are on shuffle and the operator themselves are on shuffle. I keep their default executions instead of shuffling that.

Imo I like having that little bit of variety between matches. Hearing different callouts and phrases from different operators."
It might not be a blueprint you can buy. Might have been a season pass or random unlock. That�s all I can think of.
"Nah it's definitely from a bundle, it's the notice me III one."
"They should eventually be available, the same thing happened to me. And the second problem of the new indicators is because you unlocked a Cold War item, just dismiss it."
"there was a big sale toward the end of season 6, maybe will have another sale leading up to rumored s7 in march?"
When you say sale were bundles cheaper? Wasn�t playing then
Same there�s a shotgun bundle that was there last week for the r90 I went to get a psn card to get it today got the points and now the bundles gone so rip
"They keep removing and adding old bundles to the game, assumably to make people feel like they're updating the store. They removed like half the bundles after they put MW and CW together and since then they've been randomly adding and removing them."
Thanks all for the answers!
"just wait for store circulation, happens once a week or two it's how I bought the arachnid domino and bale tachanka bundles"
The green dot is because you've unlocked one of three guns that haven't been added yet.
Congratulations
Thank you
"It sounds more likely that a hacker stole your account then sold it to someone.

That person was probably stupid naive and figured it was a legitimate account sale so they hooked their credit card up and bought MTX stuff.

Did you have Damascus unlocked before your account was stolen?"
Yes I did
"No he definitely cant because he stole you account

Not to mention if u wanted to get back at him his credit card info is on there lmaoo"
He most likely didn�t pay for the items you now have on your account just keep them all and keep playing I guess
"Hackers have unlock tools to unlock everything in the game, I doubt he spent money on cod points to get the items"
"Nope you're good, free skins, S T O N K S"
You may have had your account stolen and subsequently banned for activity while it was out of your control. This happens to a lot of people who have been hacked. When was the last time you played?
"Nope, fairly sure my account was not hacked as I had 2FA activated before even buying the game. Last time I played was 2 days ago on the 22nd, I even remember playing ni the afternoon and trying to launch the game in the evening again when I noticed I got banned."
Hell that happened to me few months ago. But for me it was that i was able to get into the lobby after game crashed twice and then i got perma banned. So the their whole talk about how they have a team looking into it is just lies. There is a bot that flags you and ban you and thats it it. And i know you might think ive been using some 3rd party program or hack but no i didnt that account had damascus skins for all weapons ive bought every season and done every season i even bought few characters from the store and they are nit cheap (1/3 of a full game in price). So no i wouldnt cheat on it i actually really like the game. And trying to find reasons as to why you got banned is impossible support will not tell you as they dont know and cant look at it. And their policy on no ban forms is just stupid imo. As for refund i would say go for it get that money back u cant play mw or warzone on this account anymore also the progress should stay with your activision account.
Have you been unbanned?
"Nope, I've given up on trying to have activision look at my case. 

I've gotten in contact with different people who eventually have gotten unbanned, or have had experience with bans before, and the only way to get activision to potentially unban you, is if your account had been hacked. Otherwise the only thing you can hope for, is for their Enforcement Team to analyze their previous bans and realize some of them were invalid and unban those accounts (which has happened to some people before, not launching battlenet for 6 months and then realizing their account got unbanned randomly). Sadly the chances of that happening are very low.

I've seen that 2 more banwaves have happened recently, and no doubt innocents have been hit by those waves too. I'm personally over CoD for now and am planning on looking back in a few months to see if I get unbanned or not. Also made the decision to not spend a dime on any of their future release too."

"AFAIK no, just go offline lol"
Yes you can
"Free-for-All. I haven't played in a bit but people run personal radar in this mode. Play objective modes for the kills needed with the JOKR, spam the Capture points. I actually enjoyed the JOKR once I got used to it.  Remember the PILA can free fire and doesn't need to lock on. Good luck."
I just love shoothouse.
Shipment is bae tho
shipment is fun but I hate shoot house
Shoothouse is overhyped and overrated

"Is your RAM on dual, or single channel, and what is the frequency it�s running on?"
"Dual channel, and please explain what you mean by frequency"
"The I3 is a bit better, but usually when you turn graphics up for scenery and other visual effects it generally lowers the FPS of the game. The I3 is roughly 10% better in terms of performance across some areas. Its not a huge boost to performance over the 7500 which also probably wont grant you the visual performance of what you want. The CPU is maybe also only part of the problem from the issues your having."
"Yes I understand it�s not much better than my previous cpu. But I seem to be getting the same FPS but at lower settings than my previous cpu. I don�t know, could be the shit job activism on did in optimizing the game"
"Here's the thing, make sure you have everything up to date and all of it updated. Then get CPU-Z and check the memory tab to see your RAM frequency and insure everything is working right."

I prefer the molotov mostly because my aim is terrible but also if I miss or need to reload I can throw down a molotov and make a fire barrier to get some space.

"I got hacked the 10th and I got my full ID on the Email so I send it and I even have the ID of the hacker on the app, I send a shit amount of videos and Imgur links with screenshots but still nothing recovered for now after 13 days  :/ I�m starting to lose hope �"
"There still may be hope, if you've been waiting 13 calendar days, they say it can take up to 10 business days, which means we've still got a day or two left for you.

Edit: Just checked, and the 10th business day would be tomorrow for you, so here's hoping!"
I had to wait 4 weeks for my account recovery to take place. My account got stolen on Jan. 29th and I just got it back yesterday. Don't give up hope.
"Sigh, I wish I had done this.

My account was hacked as well and the recovery team was ultimately unable to find my account despite having all the emails when I set it up, pics and video clips from my account, all previous name changes, etc.

GG Damascus and Cold War (purchase was tied to my activision account lmao)"
"Oh geeze man, I certainly understand the frustration there. My team wants me to play, and I can't even summon the enthusiasm to get on being at level 1 with literally nothing unlocked and all progress gone. [Here..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OstJ9SzKTYQ)"
"Did you use the CoD Companion App at any point? If so, if you open it up again, you might still be logged in and you will be able to see the name of whoever stole your account. That's how I was able to find out who took my account and report it to the recovery team."
"Wait, did you say you had 2FA on and you still got hacked?"
"Nah, I didn't, but I turned it on immediately when this all happened (on the ""new"" account they tell you to make.)"
"That isn�t the impression I got from his OP, but many others have reported that the 2FA did nothing to prevent them from losing their account so make of it what you will."
"Bruh,  how are many Activision account getting hacked ? Keep seeing these post every day"
"2FA not being enabled on the Cod website. The hackers use leaked email/passwords from other websites and use proxies and checking programs to run those email/pass on the cod site. From there, any accounts that work will be listed and they�ll sign in, change all the info, sell the acc."
"The end of this week will mark a month from me. I've been told ""they're still investigating it"" even though I've sent all the proof you've recommended. So annoying that this person just gets to play on my leveled up account and access my battle pass and stuff."
"Not that you should have to, but how many times did you reach out via the Activision chat?

For me: (Done once per day, for those first few days)

1st time - So-so.

2nd time - Dud. Barely any info, took forever, largely didn't care.

3rd time - Amazing. This guy cared about his job, and cared about the customer. Went out of his way to research, and gave me more details surrounding the process.

4th time - My account was already restored, but again, this guy was pretty great, and explained things thoroughly.

Also, not sure how much it helped, but I tried to be as up-front as possible concerning my this was so serious, how the hacker had been inviting my friends into games, and also severing existing connections I had with other players. They said they would add the details to my case, so I'm not sure if that also helped to speed things along at all.

Definitely hoping/praying you get your account back soon!"
I remember my Ubisoft account got hacked but hackers weren't able to get in because I enabled two-factor on it a long time ago and that saved my ass.
It�s bugged
"It�s likely a bug, people have been seeing operator challenges even when they don�t own the challenge set, if you�re 100% sure you own the challenges then I�m not sure."
I had a similar problem on a multiplayer mission and I already completed parts of it already and now it says get kills with either a sniper or marksman rifle while using a scope and it just doesn't work
Visual bug that allows you to see old battle pass missions
"If it's anything like Mara's, it's either bugged or we shouldn't be viewing those missions because they're from previous seasons and therefore are unavailable. It's hard to say but it's stupid at any rate."
Who�s turn is it to post this next?
"It's not even necessarily lag compensation that is the issue, [the game just has significantly more network lag compared to MW at the same ping.](https://youtu.be/Hxl4PPh_4ks?t=534)"
"For me, MW stutters like crazy while CW is fine. It�s so weird"
"> If you see someone go through a doorway, there's a good chance that he is already few hundred milliseconds ahead of you. Often times, I would get blasted even though I am in a defensive position with my gun aimed at the door

This is what happened early in MW days too.  These things got adjusted over time."
It�s probably a mix of shitty servers and SBMM not prioritizing ping

Buy the game? That�s my best bet.
"Activision makes you buy it on every platform i dont think game share will work, i have my pc and ps4 accounts linked but still had to buy it on both."
"Hmmm okay , just that it worked previously no problem ."
More details please
"So me and my friend gameshare, and I can�t access multiplayer all of a sudden as it�s locked behind a paywall, I have all the content needed downloaded on my ps5 and the gameshare settings are all correct, every other game we gameshare works fine it�s literally just MW, I tried the delete and redownload method but it didn�t work.

"I�m on Xbox, in my experience normal MW multiplayer is more laggy than Warzone."
"Ah yes, Activision�s favorite mode, Store"
CoD 2022: 8 different stores!! No pesky gameplay modes to clutter up the interface!!!
Well that�s the best comment I�ve seen all day. Goodnight internet.
that mode is so pay to win
"No matter how many upvotes this gets, it shall always be under rated"
Ay what�s your favorite game-mode on store?
"I can�t wait till they bring back shoot-the-store, 24/7 store mode"
What cracks me up the most is the store had like 5 things in it: the Endowment pack and 4 different sizes of cod points.
"I do not know if my games are broken, but the game forces for out for store and playlist updates nearly every game."
This has been talked about but I�m gonna say bullshit leaker or not I�m gonna wait and not jump and sing hallelujah over someone saying there may be new stuff
"That�s why I said to take it with a grain of salt. As credible as TGR is, it�s not confirmed by IW or Activision."
"I believe that there will be new content on March 11th, but I highly doubt that it will be advertised as season 7"
I�m just using Season 7 as the placeholder name and since that�s how it�s referred to in the articles.
I don�t think they�ll have Soap in this game. I think it would be in the next MW. But all that other stuff sounds lit. Especially Killhouse. A lot of houses in this game
Well we�ve already seen the character fully modeled so I don�t see why not.
"there are 2 types of concussion grenades: stun, and flash. check which one you are using, that might fix it idk"
I had a challenge that was kill 15 enemies blinded by your flash grenade. Not sure if that�s a different challenge but you might try shooting one and seeing if that does it.
This isn't working/tracking for me either.
Same happened too me around the time CW came out. Haven�t heard anything back......
Wish you luck. Have you tried following up with their chat support? You�ll have to sit in a long queue but it�s possible to talk to a human.
"May I suggest the fast melee perk, the breacher device, no stock, shortest barrel, and an underbarrel stun launcher"

Literally one of the easiest unlocks.
"To each their own. I felt the Grau and AS Val were a breeze. I�m not sure how meleeing with a gun would be the easiest when it�s harder than a one hit knife, personally."
Does anyone know if I buy a bundle with the grau in without unlocking it can I still change the attachments or is the attachments it comes with all I can use
You cannot change anything. You need to unlock the gun
"I can�t do it in plunder I got 10 out of 25 when tumble was here now it is gone progress is really really slow I have only gotten one since also I have the cup to buy a bundle where the grau has monolithic, tac laser, 60 round mag, archangel and commando what is the point cause then I have to get the attachments as well"
"Cause that's Cod Culture^TM . 
 
This game could've used a sniper only mode. Maybe in mw2."
That game mode is a sweaty quickscoper's dream
Have to ask.. did you switch systems? Cod points on xbox don't transfer to PC/PS and visa versa
"Nope, always been on one system."
Same thing happening to me man.
Good luck.
The next mw isn�t rumoured to come out until 2022 mate so fill your boots it�s a great game
"It's the best CoD experience out there, but it's not the ""active"" franchise title, so things like Battle Passes are all exclusive to the active title (Black Ops Cold War).  That said, older bundles are rotating back in, and newer ones are being added every now and then.  They're also hosting weekly Gunfight Tournaments with new rewards, which is promising.  Given that all MW weapons/operators are available in WZ, I think it's safe to say MW will be around for a bit."
Unless the leaks are true and March 11th is the start of Season 7 for MW
I would get MW now.
I think you want it on boost low not high for footsteps. see if that works better

"In other news, water is wet. They�re not gonna fire him for confirming what everyone already knows. CoD has been on a predictable dev cycle for years between the 3 studios."
"That plus they rebooted modern warfare. And originaly there was a modern warfare 2. So it is really not a surprise if we see something like 

""Modern Warfare 2 (2022)...no no no, not Modern Warfare 2 (2009)...no no no, not Modern Warfare 2 remastered (2020), it's the sequel to Modern Warfare (2019)""

Cause why be original when you can just add a year at the end of a previously licenced title."
"water is not wet

''wet'' describes a property applied to a surface covered or saturated in water, which can be dried off

you cannot cover or saturate water in itself (you just get more water), same as you cannot dry it by removing water from itself (you just get less water)"
"No, your comment is largely incorrect. COD hasn't been on a predictable dev cycle since MW3. After Infinity Ward stopped making the original MW games there is no predictability to the title they were going to make, the Infinite Warfare audience response shows that. Sledgehammer has no established IP, so they could well be making a new game from one of their existing IP or using a completely new one. Treyarch is the only predictable one but even then the Black Ops franchise was supposed to end after the commercial failure that BO4 was. Cold War isn't really a Black Ops game, it's Raven's cold war game with black ops characters put in last minute by Treyarch. Not to mention COD doesn't follow the proper three year cycle since Sledgehammer got removed from making this years COD game."
Were you saying minute 2 second 5 or hour 2 minute 5 lol
"You know what, I completely forgot you need to add an extra two digits for hours, sorry. Fixed the dates in the post, but it�s supposed to be 2 hours"
It's at [2:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74AY1iDk3R0#t=2h08m50s)
So filming/mocapping this summer definitely means 2022 release date right? No way would they be doing that a few months from launch haha

Treyarch. Notice their logo has rounded corners and it�s not a pointy triangle? Because those fuckers always ALWAYS cut corners. Take the extra 5 minutes and make it nicer.
Maybe it�s cuz Treyarch came into CW late cuz of sledgehammer and didn�t have enough time for things like this. But in the end they should�ve had it.
It�s cause it�s a Cold War gun. All the modern warfare weapons have insane attention to detail. Whereas the Cold War weapons were half assed.
Beat me to it! Modern Warfare gets the bolt/ammo mechanics right and it's my favorite little area of the game I love to nerd out on
"People blaming Treyarch but if you inspect the gun in Cold War, the bullet is there. So it�s probably a bug."
Why are you showing a cold war gun on a modern warfare subreddit.
Because it's in Modern Warfare.
What gun is that? Never seen it before.

She was there all this time:) [https://blog.activision.com/call-of-duty/2020-08/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Season-Five-expands-Warzone](https://blog.activision.com/call-of-duty/2020-08/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Season-Five-expands-Warzone)
Yo IW when are the unreleased guns coming out
Ehh put the mask back on
Also I was doing them in warzone if that changes anything
Because it�s hard steel
"You can shoot through most of shoothouse's walls, even the thickest ones, but you cant shoot through stair railings and thin ass stuff like the ones in the clip. It makes no sense at all, this game isnt a milsim."
Booker T would be proud of that Spinaroonie
Damn she got moves
She bustin a move fr
Hes possessed by demons LoL
Break it down b girl
Hahhaa I get that all the time
no offence  but what the hell is that ak47 loadout lol
It looks weird cause it�s a blueprint
I started using the Val and damn is this thing fast
"Yeah man. I used it right when I unlocked it, and dang is it good. I eventually got sick of using it (and didn�t want to be a hypocrite) and moved on."
[deleted]
I only use the Val on shoot the ship playlist
Is my SPR loaded with blanks or something? I swear when I use it I fire nothing and get hitmarkers
"No clue, man. I just know from a handful of experiences I�ve had with the weapon. It seems to one shot in upper body and head, or maybe just head, idk. If it is one shot just to the head, then I�m probably just bad."
Just use the lupua rounds and it basically one shots no matter what
"Core has absolutely atrocious weapon balancing. Players underestimate Activision's propensity for psychological manipulation, too. Every season they release an OP weapon the outperforms the rest to encourage players to buy early unlocks. They usually nerfed the weapon by the time the season is over so the next could be OP without people noticing."
"I wouldn't call it atrocious. As Val is the only gun nearing OP levels imo. Pretty much every other gun is viable. 

LMGs and snipers are a bit too slow for 6v6 but the rest are good"
Of spr and kar which one is better for mp and warzone? I am one game away from unlocking the spr I�m not feeling the kar in warzone all I get is hit markers maybe I don�t have the right attachments I guess
"the kar is the best in warzone. You need to aim for the head. Always, always try head shots with that thing, or you'll break plates at most. If you're getting hitmarkers with the kar98k, it's literally going to be the same for you with the spr."
"I just laugh at people using the Kar and SPR. Nobody is impressed. Those guns definitely give bad players more chances than they should ever have. Probably why they tend to use them exclusively. The SPR needs to be toned down for sure. Sorry, but if I'm already shooting you, it means I acquired you faster with a lower ADS time and then began to do damage. You shouldn't have a Get Out Of Jail Free card because your weapon has no flinch and does a OSK. SPR can be fun to use, but only because it's broken."
the worse part is that the marksman rifles got rotational aimassist! (snipers only got the slow down)
"This,  this and this! I hope the next COD removes quickscoping. It should not be a thing."
they buffed the kar season5 then made a better kar season 6 or some stupid shit like that. Old kar was good but they did a stupid buff then added a new one that was stronger. It's so fucking dumb.
"with a post about op guns, i�m surprised you didn�t mention the 725."
Want to talk about dragon breath bags to?
"Yeah, that gun is pretty OP too. I�m guilty of using it, actually. I don�t think it�s quite as bad, as it only have two shots before a fairly long reload, but the range could use some toning down."
"Kar takes skill, but SPR is plain and simple broken. The damage of an ax50 with lapua rounds and the ads speed of the kar? who�s idea was that? Not to mention the crazy aim assist on it. Its incredibly annoying when i�m using a kar and I just get shit on by good ol Timmy with his broken ass lapua spr. And yeah everyone knows the as val needs to be nerfed badly."
Keep telling yourself that the kar needs skill buddy
If a sniper hit you in real life there would be a huge hole in your body. Idc if a sniper is one shot. It�s supposed to be that way. Especially if they hit a headshot. Asking for more and more nerfs on different guns. Especially ones doing exactly what there supposed to just ruins the whole realistic point to the game and just starts turning into another fortnight.
Bringing realism into the equation is just not a good idea. Because then you need to accept that lots of the guns in the game would drop you in one shot and pretty much all would kill if you got hit in the head. It's a matter of balance. Some guns are just unbalanced and fuck up the game.
"This game isn�t realistic in the slightest, though? Hardcore is as realistic as you�ll get in this game. Irl you can�t get shot a bunch and heal after a few seconds. I do understand what you mean, though. I�m fine with the actual snipers, such as the HDR, AX, and the other one. They have a slower scope in time, are heavier, and don�t have quite as much mobility. I�m angry because the Kar and SPR are basically slightly less powerful snipers that still have one shot potential, along with mobility, and very fast ads."
It�s a typo error use the renetti it�s fine
"Its in co-op mode, either way just use the renetti"
It a stupid mistake that the devs were too lazy to fix
Seems to be a lot of those these days
"Uh, definitely in the game files."
First time on COD?
That's it... get it all out..
He�s never played BO2 or MW2 has he....
Your beating a dead horse my guy
Don't be a baby
"CoD would benefit massively if players could host and moderate their own lobbies.
They could set their own rules and other players who are like minded can join.

People want to 1v1 with snipers? Join the right Lobby.
People want a lobby without cheaters? Join a well moderated lobby.
People want a non toxic, friendly lobby? Join a lobby that kicks toxic players.

You could get a community of like minded players."
Man if campers cared for the least they would have listened to the milion other people that think luke us. But they don't care. Aparently they think thats how you play games and they have been a desease to the shooter genre for years. It's just sad to see they play 1v1 tho. The whole idea is to get out there and test you skill against another player.
Looks like it took you and your buddy 26 attempts to stage this correctly
i guess you did not read the title.
"Clean. Gg

Every critic posts a better shot or shuts ther mouth"
Staged
read the title my dude.
I can�t lie it�s not as impressive when it�s staged
Stinks
360 no scopes are pretty easy to do in a controlled environment.

"Heard someone in the subreddit comments say that they're probably gonna go straight to the store. Hoping each operator will have a mission by default, and then put the others in the store."
"Because there�s supposedly season 1 bundles coming to allow people to buy skins from past passes.

It�s just a visual bug saying you have access but you dont"
There�s definitely diminishing returns on STS; you get less XP the more you kill.
"This happened to me a while ago, then out of nowhere all XP was gone!"
What bothers me most is no longer receiving exp from matches you joined in-progress. Shits lame.
"Its intentional, Cold war gives the most exp out of the three and warzone gives the most battle pass exp. I've tested all three personally and those were the results they want you to play the ""new"" games because money."
"I own Cold War but it looks so bad in comparison to mw, I hate mw because of how people play the game. Why can�t they just use the mw engine on Cold War? It�s always been like that. Infinity wars makes the engine and treyarch improves it"
Its not a bug sadly
May we please have a tracer for the uzi some cool that turn you into bones when you get hit
"Based on the files that were shown, you might get a chance at old seasons content in the form of ""vault packs"" (assuming they actually release them) which will give you some or maybe even all of a single seasons content. We don't know for sure yet but there's rumor that they'll cost real world money and not COD points. Who knows though."
"A nice idea, but Activision have something far less consumer friendly lined up. Cod Tracker (and the missions for S1 operators appearing but unable to be completed on operators like Mara and Bale) shows that they are just going to sell the overpriced bundles with S1 content inside. [https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400305-battle-pass-season-1-pack](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400305-battle-pass-season-1-pack)"
Same I want to go back and get the tier 100 shadow AN-94 and tier 100 Red shadow AS VAL :/
I heard we getting season 7 on March 11th 2021
"There might be a season 7, but there won�t be another battle pass :/."
Proof...?
"All the leakers are pointing to that date which is the day after the 1 year anniversary. Something big is coming, hopefully a new map"
"I support this, I also missed all BPs before Season 5 and I would love to be able to buy them and complete them too.

Maybe a system similar to what Halo: The Master Chief Collection does would be nice, that is previous Battle Passes being always available to complete at your own leisure.

Talking seriously, it's quite unlikely, but a man can dream right?"
yeah Halo MCC's system is awesome
"Exactly, I missed out on all the great Mil Sim operator skins which sucks a lot..."
"I would love to be able to access old battle passes, I'd even be willing to pay money for the ones I didn't finish back in the day. I hate the new gaming trend of limited time content, all it does is pressure people to spend ludicrous amounts of time grinding because of FOMO"
[removed]
"I've been playing since launch, but never bought S1, and never got to finish S2 completely."
Lols
"If they are from the battlepass, unfortunately they are only available on cw weapons/operators. The only things from the bp u can use in mw is calling cards and emblems. There are also some vehicle skins that u could use in groundwar."
May we please have a tracer for the uzi some cool that turn you into bones when you get hit
"Ah what a load of bollox, fuck Cold War so haha"
Yeah its because of cold war. Most of the battle pass stuff is cold war only.
It's from the battlepass for coldest and you can only access it in warzone or cold war but I don't like warzone and fuck cold war
"It�s fucking stupid, trying everything to get people to buy Cold War, they are really trying hard hahaha. Still not buying it"
"Wrong sub  


You want

"[It seems this happens with any blueprint attachment that's intended for one ""body type"" but didn't get its ""alternate body type"" model added properly; the attachment will be invisible and the gun won't be usable, just like you described.](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/bleedinguranium/video/126602166)

u/artpeasant is there any hope we could see this fixed?"
Shh be quiet it could be a nice speed hack
"It actually just occurred to me that it doesn't do it with all attachment variants, [as seen here,](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b7954vttjn33xtv/8mb.video-nEN-bLmvRHs9.mp4?dl=0) so it's only select weapons and/or blueprints it would seem."
"Honestly I don�t mind if it isn�t, it�s really goofy and fun lmao"
Yo this might be a good search tactic because you get fist level movement speed
This is cool. Any way to switch to pistol like this or you�re stuck no gun? I think a lot of people have wanted pistol only + knife as a custom class for a long time
Can you shoot fireballs out your hands?
I am speed
It isn�t meant to be there and you can�t complete them
The mission is a bug and isn't meant to be available to us yet. Just ignore it.
">The mission is a bug and isn't meant to be available to us yet. Just ignore it.

WTF? I play on Battlenet. Is the error the same for all platforms? I did the Farah missions yesterday and completed them fast. I wanted to keep unlocking skins"
Best P90 sight
The only p90 sight!
"The more I watch and listen, the harder I giggle."
"I will never get tired of seeing this king of shit. I love it in Ground War and Warzone, seeing bodies cartwheel off of the buildings Downtown"
lmao how did this happen
Why tf aren�t they being toxic? What kind of magic is this?
Happens once every full moon from my experience
I love how they accepted it instead of being toxic like a normal SND lobby
"""*Accepted*"" sorry that was bugging the hell out of me lol"
I personally enjoy a toxic lobby. It�s nostalgic and energizing
"If they were British they would be screaming ""nonce"" at him( it means paedophile)."
Positive chat at the end!!
"Holy shit dude. That was pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good!"
"Just point and click, friends. Point and click."
Sam&Max would like to have a word XD
Oh my gosh what was that!!! never saw an ace that fast ever in my life
You are sick at this game.your aim was on point.well done!!!
My god it's JASON BOURNE
"""Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!""  it's JOHN WICK!"
"What cool guys, being nice and supportive of that awesome play."
At least they gave props. Hate it when you have a moment of glory like that and everyone is screaming hacker. Nice flicks
Never left the house.... ever
"Well played, the death coms make it even better"
"He just went full John Wick mode, fantastic"
What is your platform?  I can never quickscope like that on PC!   Note that some platforms have aim assist.   Excellent shooting no matter! Upvote.
I'm on PC haha
Nice clutch mate. A well deserved win. Now carry my team please.
I probably would�ve panicked and missed a shot
What do you mean A shot? I would have missed them all
I never even saw the guys he was killing
Take this updoot pls. 10/10
Are you the guy from wanted
Nobody gonna talk about this guy scoping in before people peak
Well played!
That was sexy

Heysoose
They all had the most priceless reactions to their deaths lol.
I still don�t understand how people can snipe like that...
"If I ever hit that, I would never hit ti again"
*cries in having having played cod steadily on both pc and console for the last 10 years and still really bad*

Quick-scoper kid
"Honest question. I can never figure out how OP is able to �know� where the enemy is right as he�s coming around corners or the enemy is coming around corners. What am I missing

Honestly trying to be better at anticipating"
"Here's what I wrote on another comment : 

Playing 1v6 you just know you're about to get rushed. I check bot middle quick for a first pick, then needed to check the right because I didnt see anyone else middle. When killing the dude, I switched back to middle fast in case someone else would be late mid. While turning after my second kill, I had high alert popped for 0.4s (seems like you didnt notice). I made a note to check middle once again for 1 second and turn to kill right again if no one was there. Turns out there was someone mid again. Now I knew one dude was coming from the right (plus footsteps) and had another high alert for 5th guy. Footsteps for the 6th one. Also rushing 1v6 no one goes left, its too long. 

tl;dr Footsteps + high alert in SnD is OP. Also 1v6 is more predictable. Do not reproduce at home"
when the whole other team hypes you up
You are absolutely cracked

CRACKED
My luck I�d have been called a string of racial slurs and accused of hacking lmfao

what game is this im new to COD

100% at least 1 of the people you killed called hacks

This gives me a headache because of you fov
I don�t see the problem with it tbh. 120 is perfect for me.
console huh?
"Ah yes, love seeing a fellow ninja on here."
These should never be a 1 hit kill. Just doesn't make an sense.
"It's a balancing thing. Throwing knives are harder to use than guns so the game rewards you for making a hit. I know it's not ""realistic"" but it's a game."
but a plastic glock is 2 hit on warzone
headshots probably should be 1 hit kill though
"Here you go - [https://damascus.now.sh/](https://damascus.now.sh/)

The weapons on the Damascus list are the same for unlocking plat for those weapons."
To get the platinum skin you have to get gold on all the marksman rifles.
Just the original ones. You don't need the SPR or Crossbow.
[deleted]
"You need to get the marksman and sniper classes, excluding the download weapons, all gold to unlock platinum.  The link provided by u/littlefluffusnowfrog helps to track."
It�s still shows me as �private� rank on the leaderboards but in game it�s show me my prestige rank. So weird
"Rank icons are fucked up, but basically once you get to lvl 50 something, you get to Officer Rank 1, so it kind of starts counting again, but at the same time, you'll see after the match that you're level 56 or 60, or 120 or whatever your rank currently is, even if your officer rank shows under lvl 10.   


It's very dumb."
"I made a detailed post regarding this issue, yesterday. With screenshot and explanation of the inconsistencies and problems. It was removed by the moderators (wtf?)."
its wasn't a shitty quickscope video so it deserve attention /s
May we please have a tracer for the uzi some cool that turn you into bones when you get hit
"The game does 1-55, then resets and goes 1-1000 (IIRC)

For some reason the MW lobby screens have a bug where they show you the 55 + reset level. They're counting the initial 55 levels while other rank screens do not

The prestige level (lower number) is what it should be displaying"
"You�re gonna have to walk us through how you came to the conclusion that adding an orange glow would fit the theme of it being obsidian. Not saying it would look bad, but obsidian is literally just black"
"Because obsidian is formed when lava cools rapidly. Obviously obsidian itself is just a black rock, but when it comes to a camo, having something else like that just makes it a bit more interesting"
"I like obsidian BECAUSE its all black. This is the first mastery camo ive actually wanted to attain for the aesthetic & not just to show skill (which it doesnt anyway. Any person can get 15 kills in a game & repeat 100-200 times. As opposed to something like the crossbow on Black Ops 2, where you needed bloodthirsty medals and only spawned with 6 bolts, and enemies killed by impact of the bolt itself **did not count**, and enemies killed by the explosion of the bolt *did not drop scavenger ammo bags*)"
"Each to their own I guess. Everyone has preferences. I just personally like my camos to have a bit more flair. Gold camo is better than platinum imo just because of the line patterns and things. Platinum is just silver with a digital camo on it, which just doesn't look very good"
"Honestly, even just something to make obsidian look a little bit interesting would be nice. So something like that would actually be pretty neat."
"I really like the obsidian camo but it's hard to appreciate because unless you look really close, it's hard to tell someone has obsidian and call of duty isn't exactly the game for looking at pretty weapons :D"
"When I first saw the obsidian camo I though it was the most beautiful and tacticool thing I ever saw, then it rendered fully."
Doesn't obisdian irl have a purple hue to it?
"Obsidian irl is totally black. Only minecraft makes it purple.

Reason I said orange is because obsidian is formed from lava."
Minecraft?
The amount of reactions I get to obsidian are worth it but I did it for looks and that I didn�t want to grind Damascus (which I ended up doing aswell lol)
[deleted]
Trump lost you pussy
Except it not AK-12 and you can find same guns in every mission where you fight Barkov's men
those are ak47s this ones different the barrel is different and the gun is black
"It just says ak12, it�s an ak47 with attachments"
it looks different like an ak47 variant its black and the ones i found had different attachments
"it ain't no AK12 that is nothing but a modified AK47.

Search up AK12 to see how they actually look like, there is one AK12 variant in COD Ghosts."
"it literally says in the third picture ""Square"" AK-12 i found multiple with different attachments from holographic scopes to VLK 3.0X scopes and 75rnd extended mags and normal 30rnd mags"
"They show up in the mission where you raid the Russian airbase too, but yeah, they're not AK-12's.

It says AK-12, but it's really not."
"You want an AK12 in multiplayer use the spetnaz barrel and 5.45 conversion for ammunition and bam, the models are the exact same so it's only the basis of naming differences"
Still not a real ak12 though
"It's literally just the Steel Curtain blueprint with the default magazine and folding stock.

It's not an AK-12. The AK-12 is completely different. The single player just calls it that because people were complaining since MW1 that the Russian forces are still using AK-47s for some fucking absurd reason so IW just renamed the AK-47 to AK-12 and slapped on an aftermarket handguard."
Is this satire?
It's in several other missions - whenever you fight against Russians. Heck I just recently restarted the campaign - it's the very first enemy weapon you get as floor loot after shooting the patrols in the forest on the very first mission.
"Just attachments for the AK47.
Put the short barrel on the MP5 and it says MP5K."
AK12 = AK47
"Ehhhhhh not really...

Edit: ok apparently you fucktards don't understand how guns work."
Poor guy is getting downvoted for every comment he makes
The R9-0 is even labeled as DP-12 in the last mission.
"Also the AK-12 is in fact in other missions, namely the first one, the last one, and I believe the airfield one toward the end"
It�s been saying this from the very beginning. I played the campaign in the first week of release and I was finding AK-12s everywhere.
I wish that they would finally add the modern ak-12 (not the prototype) to the game
thats not even close to an ak-12
"AK-12's are all over the campaign, probably saw that weapon more than any other on the ground. You can recreate it in multiplayer, all it is is: Steel Curtain AK-47 + Spetsnaz Elite Barrel. Voila, ""AK-12"""
"Yeah thats what the spetsnaz frequently use in the campaign, only reason why its not in MP is because you can make it with the gunsmith. The R9-0 in the final mission is called the DP-12 (R9-0 irl) and it had dragons breath rounds wayyy before they were added in MP."
"ALRIGHT I GET IT 


its just an ak47 thats black! no need to comment anymore ive gotten like 30 notifications"
It�s not an ak12...
"AK12 is a AK47 in 5.45, technically its a AK-74 and the AK12 is the AK-200. but I may be wrong"
"Well... if speaking completely oversimplified to the point of ""Its a gun, its doing RATATATATA"""
AK-12(and -15) is a new design based off the original AK-74(or -47 depending on calibre) which has been developed in the AK-200 before finalised as the AK-400.
this one had less recoil and a faster firerate too
"Funny enough I have the opposite problem, I keep shipment more then shoot house"
Wish I could experience that lol
"Well don�t blame the game, at least you stayed. It�s people who keep lobby-shopping for Shipment that are screwing you up. They back-out of ShootHouse lobbies leaving those lobbies unoccupied and the game logically should have more chance to put you in a SH lobby than a Shipment one. The game is just doing it job tho, and really they never claimed for it to be a balanced mix between SH and SM anyway. I�m not blaming you, I guess it is just the region you are playing have a lot of people who do that. I have been blessed this time as I got SH and SM at a balance rate, but I�m a ShootHouse person so I don�t really mind."
I was thinking the same thing the other day! What happened to us being able to choose or vote on a map!?
"There used to be map voting when there were connection based lobbies. The same people would remain in the lobby after the game ended. Now the the lobby is disbanded after every game and it matchmakes you into a new one for sbmm.

A lot of people leave when it's shoothouse so you frequently get dropped into the available slot because everyone is trying to play shipment"
"I don't know about choosing or voting for the map, since Modern Warfare came out there wasn't that option IIRC."
It'll be fine its because there's a slot in that match I'm sure you'll get shipment soon
"When I play shoot the ship on hardcore, I get shipment more often than shoot house or it is balanced between those occasionally."
Yeah I was actually confused as to whether shipment was even in that mode lol.
Its there but takes some time to reroll for it
"Damn welcome to MW 2019. It�s been like that from the get go, the game favors every other map in a playlist over shipment"
I feel like it�s 75% shoot house and 25% shipment. It�s definitely not split 50/50.
"It�s not really the playlists fault. It�s people constantly backing out of shoothouse maps and searching for shipment ones, meaning shoothouse is usually empty for spots whereas shipment is usually full"
It's more like 85% Shoot house and 10-15% Shipment. So annoying since they know that most of the people like Shipment!

It�s because third person isn�t a bug as such. When getting revived the camera goes into third person but I don�t actually know how to trigger the �bug� bit that makes it permanent.
"If it was a mode where everyone had to use 3rd person view, sure. I don't personally want to play any shooter in 3rd person, but I know others want it.

However, letting someone change it on the fly in regular game modes... Well, that would be the worst idea I've ever heard of. It completely changes what you can see. You can peak corners without even showing yourself."
"ehh, idk, battlefront 2 does it and it�s still a pretty fun game"
Looks awesome
I miss third person mode.
The new division looks awesome
I couldn�t agree anymore
Why not?
I mean.. I�d play this.
"First person shooters with purchasable character skins always frustrated the hell out of me. Who am I entertaining with the skin? My team? The enemy?

Only FPS that felt like it had meaning to it's character creation/customization was Rainbow six Vegas since it had a 3rd person cover mechanic.

Other than that the best a FPS can do is have some sort of cut scene that showcases your character? But this game doesn't even have that. But yeah blow 15$ on a character skin pack to look at your hands or see yourself get killed in a killcam."

"I'd honestly pay for a third person view on cod

this shit looks fleshed out for a bug... hoping to see it in the future"
this shit look like gta especially the aiming
They should make it a official playlist
Looks so perfect! All it's really missing is an aiming reticle.
"This is a first person shooter, not a third person shooter."
"go fucking play the divisions then call of duty is a first person game, god why cant call just be happy with something"
You obviously never played mw2.
Ironic your comment seems to be the most miserable one.
"Take your own advice and be happy with it then you fucking moron, you can only do 3rd person PvE. Stop fucking whining, you look mad dumb."
"Cold War is a fucking garbage excuse of a game. Literally takes steps in the opposite direction from MW in terms of gameplay, game barely runs correctly at all, terrible balancing issues, and it�s just being forced on us"
"I play both modern warfare and cold war, I enjoyed both campaigns a lot, they were both pretty good with well detailed cutscenes and storylines. I feel like cold war has done a really good job with firebase Z in zombies, and aspects of modern warfare multiplayer are brilliant (not map design tho, I feel like cold war has an edge there, even though they're reused older maps (namely nuketown raid and crossroads)), however there are some good ones that I enjoy like shoothouse and rust. 

I feel like both games have their ups and downs, but activision are 100% just shitting on modern warfare because they want people to buy cold war. I dont regret my decision to buy it, I genuinely enjoyed some of it, but no other cod (as far as I know) has had its loading screen among other stuff ripped away to make room for advertising the new one, fuck, even the icon screen on consoles has changed"
"I'm not \*too\* bothered by it. But I wouldn't say I love it either.

Mainly, I'd rather Warzone NOT be slapped all over modern warfare. MW doesn't even get a spotlight on the launcher. The tab is just called ""Warzone"", then when you click on it, MW is in small letters underneath. It's like it's saying, oh yeah, this is warzone, but also has this little side game, modern warfare in it. Not cool. I don't want to download warzone. I don't like Warzone. The game I paid for is forcing me to download another game that I literally do not care about.

In regards to your question about drive space, it likely would take up the same amount of space if WZ and MW were separated. However, for people who only play one of the games, it's beneficial cause they don't have to download the game that they don't want to, so in that scenario it takes up less."
"Yeah, it's honestly stupid, MW is its own game, why is it now just a walking advertisement for a shitty game (mostly mp, I actually kind of like zombies and the campaign) that was put together too quickly and didn't have enough time put into it. 

I don't personally play warzone, and would appreciate having 3 launchers for the game (mostly so I could uninstall warzone) and so that I don't keep getting cold war cosmetics and blueprints on modern warfare, bcs at this point its just annoying

I figured as they would count as two seperate games that the data would have to be duplicated for modern warfare and warzone, therefore pretty much doubling the space it woul take up, but idkr what im talking about"
"In this case, Cold War and Warzone should leave MW2019 the fuck alone and form their own application."
"I feel like the cross pregression is good, and having cold war guns in warzone is pretty good too (I dont play it but people who do seem to like it) but the rest is crap, mw doesnt get its own battle pass anymore, yet you can still purchase the cold war one in modern warfare which is honestly stupid"
If the rumors of them testing it on the new Cold War engine are true then it very well may be separated from Modern Warfare in the future.
"Dont do that...

Dont give me hope"
"I think it�s good for Warzone but shit for MW multiplayer and to a lesser extent,CW multiplayer"
As a mostly Cold War player I can understand why MW players are upset with the integration. Warzone and Cold War marketing�s slapped all over MW and the battle pass which you can progress and purchase in Mw provides zero items for Mw MP
"I feel like without the weird parts of the integration I would have been fine with it, I tend to stick to modern warfare for multiplayer, but I do play zombies a fair bit as well. But with the loading screen, theres an option to switch to cw/wzn/mw rather than cw having its own Campaign - Multiplayer - Zombies loading screen and modern warfare keeping its old one.

I know it would've been massively demanding but had they just added cold war onto the side of modern warfare, so you go into a ""Call of Duty launcher"" and from there you pick which one you want to play, that would've been way better than the modern warfare logo changing to stitch with price pushed to the side, the background as your pc/console loads the files for the game being stitch, the ""connecting to datacenters"" screen being stitch, but a full body shot this time, and then having cold war being the default for your starting spot for the loading screen, along with the usual ""buy in the pack shop"" and ""hey you wanna try cold war"" in the tips section (both of which im fine with)"

"I saw this on another post and to get co-op working I can confirm this worked for me

"Dave Chappelle resents his old skits.

Never heard why he refused to continue Chappelle show? Or the time he walked out on a talk show because some jackass in the crowd annoyed him by repeating the Rick James quote?"
"Man, I don't care if it's his old skits or not. The man is hilarious and his comedic tone would be perfect. I used those as examples because they're the most recognizable examples people can imagine"
"Also, he doesn't ""resent"" his show. He left because he didn't want to become the level of famous he was approaching, and on later thought, agreed that his show was a little over the top despite still recognizing its success."
Honestly I prefer if they brought the grandma back. That was the real mvp.
maybe Ice Cube this time?

That must have changed... cuz I have akimbo for renetti and obv didn�t do that bs cuz it wasn�t even in the game yet.
I got the renetti maxed out and the akimbo chalenge is a little bit hard but not impossible

It�s was in custom games and It was meant to be an AS Val but for some reason it�s glitched and made it into that
Makes it even funnier that kar98 and SPR are basically clones
Kar98k and SPR are king. People wanna complain about guns like the AS-Val but that gun doesn't matter when you can just insta-tap people from across the map through a quickscope with the SPR/Kar98k

"Splinter is the ground vehicles and streaks right? If so, they do count. In terms of tips, I just got really lucky, plenty of people used personal UAVs. I did it in ground war."
"Personal radar counts as a ground vehicle.  So when using the RPG, target just in front of the direction it�s moving, don�t wait till it�s stopped. 

For the strella, use the scope marks to adjust and lead your shot accordingly.  It�s basically a giant shotgun slug.

Counter UAV�s and VTOL jets will also count as ground based vehicles, so hit with a rocket, fire a few rounds and then hit with your second rocket and that should take it down.

Best of luck and don�t give up."
Thanks ile try not to
Google the error code
Can't find it it says CHASTISE
"If you think that�s bad don�t try the Syd ghillie suit.  

It literally blocks the entire bottom half of the screen when you aim."
"Wow and people paid for these bundles with real money...

It's actually sad that they don't care about it and not fix it immediately."
Even the CDL 2021 skins are bugged. When you tac sprint you can see the left arm cover part of the screen. This doesn�t happen with other Operators.
"I�ve played muted since the end of mw3, I couldn�t even tell you a lobby conversation I�ve heard in like 6 years lol"
I miss the trash talking days of MW2.
"I always play with voice chat off. I only have text chat on on PC, but even that is a mess. My first day back just 2 days ago, and a few games in I already got called racist and homophobic slurs for ""mounting every corner"" (I was going for mount challenges - I don't like it either, but you gotta do what you gotta do).

The amount of trashtalk and whininess in this community is absurd. Even worse than Overwatch, and that place is a goddamn mess."
"I always mute, I can�t bear to listen to in-game chat or tolerate someone�s feedback."
"I loved S&D and Cyber but as soon as start speaking to give call outs, all I get is the standard �get back to the kitchen�. It�s great when you get a team that works together, gives great callouts, and knows how to play the game tactically. Makes it worth it. But you�ll always get one idiot that�s just shouts slurs and abuse, ruining it for everyone."
Just it�s presence helped you out lmao
"Honestly that�s how I feel most of the time. I die more times going to the buy station to get it then it has ever actually saved me.

Next time when you wouldn�t have a lethal go in balls deep and try to since the guy. You�ll come out with a great clip
"Damn that part of the map reminds me of the dock featured in JoJo Golden wind, when green tea starts his mold attack"
"Nice clip, also pls give a lower saturation a try"
"I hate using thermal, but I was trying to finish up the reticles. I also tried to jump but ended up climbing instead. 

Sniping is by far my favorite thing to do in this game and I now have the MK2, KAR, SPR,  and AX50 obsidian. I might go for the HDR next so I can have all bolt actions obsidian, but that depends on whether or not I get a couple days off with shipment."
"I didn�t start sniping until 8 months into the games release and ever since I picked them up, I haven�t gone back to other weapons aside from melees/throwing knives. It�s been so long that I get shit on whenever I pull out my obsidian MP5 from before I started sniping .

Your clip was good. You�re about to be sniping in the blue reticle."
I did it without shoot the ship and it was such a grind lol
You poor soul. I don�t even try whenever shoot the ship isn�t out.
What�s the setup for it? Seems 50x better than mine lol
"It�s just every attachment that increases the ads speed aside from the thermal. I usually use regular scope and FMJ instead, but I was trying to finish the reticle challenges. I feel like thermal makes it 10x harder to quickscope, at least for me. A normal scope or zoom definitely work best."
Am not surprised players camping behind the container door...
"Your post from modernwarfare was removed because of: 'Relevancy Guidelines'

"This are visual bugs. I�m 99% sure you�re not supposed to be able to see these challenges, well at least right now you�re not.

This is most likely due to the season 1 vault packs that have been on the files for a long time already and are yet to be released."
"Well I got ONE to work - Raines with Stopping Power can be finished via Plunder. So that one I was wrong about, kinda. Still makes no sense how it's worded, that applying SP in Plunder works but in Multi doesn't.

So the ones that don't say ""Season X', but instead say ""Operator Mission"" with no Season listed, we're not supposed to have yet?"
Weird. Definitely a cruise missile and not a Jokr missile?
This would suck
no. for console players maybe.
As if there weren�t enough campers in Warzone modes...this would just give them all the tools to sit on one side of the map and never move.  Add the hacker issues and you�ve got even more of a mess.
"BO4 and CW are the only games to do Snipers Only right as far as I know. I don't want to ask MW to do anything ""Snipers Only"" because then we just get their random ass attachments."
"her season 1 default skin and tier 100 show up as challenges i can complete but the challenges don't track and won't complete.

i dont own those skins since i never got the season 1 battle pass.

i'm wondering if its just a bug or if they made it so that season 1 skins can be unlocked now"
I think it relates to how IW�s planning to release past battle pass contents into the store and these challenges showing are just glitches.
It�s a bug u won�t be able to do them
100% bug. appeared with the update 3 weeks ago. mission cannot be done.
"you know you can turn crossplay off right? 

unless your talking about warzone"
"I totally get you. I'm not happy with having CW shoved down my throat. And the Battle.net launcher has a link for ""Upgrade Available"" - that takes you to a page to buy Cold War. That's not an upgrade - that's a DIFFERENT FUCKING GAME. 

However, none of what they have done appears to be illegal to me. Unethical, discourteous to the customer base, misleading -  yes. Illegal, no. This is a case of Lawful Evil. And Activision is beholden to shareholders who want more revenue.

There is something to understand - anyone who bought MW did not ""buy"" a game - they bought a license to play a game. You don't even own the license, it is issued to you by Activision, and the license can be revoked or terminated under the conditions stated in the TOS and the Software License Agreement. None of us own the game. This is typically how proprietary software works.

More importantly here, the Software Licensing Agreement and the TOS allows Activision to change the content at any time, at their discretion - without notice or consent. These legally binding documents (that were agreed to by anyone who installed the game) also state that the game is not guaranteed to be fully functional/playable at all times - a fine cover-your-ass for Activision releasing broken updates. And furthermore, Activision can kill the game entirely at any time for any reason - by simply terminating access to the game to everyone who bought a license to play the game. 

Please understand that I'm not supporting Activision and their decision to basically make MW a billboard for Cold War, I'm just explaining how they are able to do what they've done and not get into any legal hot water over it. 

Next time you go to install a game or any other program, grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink to keep you awake and fully read the TOS and/or License agreement before installing. Heck, even compare a license for open source software to proprietary software. Actually see what rights you truly have as a consumer."
"I appreciate you laying all of that out. Like I had responded to someone earlier, I know the question sounded dumb as hell and I was 99% sure nothing illegal was happening, but it's just crazy to me how much of the game was taken over by Warzone and Cold War. It felt like it went well beyond the normal means of promoting/advertising.

Again, appreciate your response!"
I know its the cod cycle but mw2019 was too well received to have it's identity all fucked up.
They should've been separate games. But they wanted to exploit the MW player base. Now we have this trash.
"This happens with every cod 


Boot up ghosts you�ll get �Try the new exo movement in advance warfare .� 

When the next cod comes out Cold War is gonna have the same thing with 

�Experience the new story in cod 2021 WW3�"
"It's was never this.... Intense, for lack of a better word. They really shove it in your face."
"2021 COD is WW2, just a heads up"
"Huh, I don�t remember that or at least it was never as egregious as it is currently in which case I missed all those promotions in earlier CoD�s."
"Yeah I stopped playing MW for a bit then I came back and people are shooting me with guns that turn me into a pile of electricity and ash like a fuckimg lazer gun but they wouldn't put zombies in the game because ""wE WanT iT tO bE rEaLiStiC"" 

Fuck that I'm out I have better things to do with my life than waste it on this trash game.

And yeah getting all the random unlocks for cold war, wtf... so dumb."
"Yea it�s also extremely annoying that Warzone is it�s own separate F2P game (you can install it on its own through the store), but it�s also PERMANENTLY installed with the full Modern Warfare game. You can uninstall the Multiplayer, Campaign, and Spec-Ops, but you CANT uninstall Warzone. Why can�t I uninstall a part of the game that literally is its own being and runs as a separate game? I don�t play Warzone, I hate BR. All it�s doing is taking up space on my hard drive. 

As I just said (restating it because it�s so stupid), Warzone is it�s own separate game that you can download and install from the store. Okay cool. So please tell me why it�s also permanent attached to my actual Modern Warfare game. The game is MP, Campaign, and Spec-ops. Warzone is it�s own thing. Yet I can uninstall everything else...but not Warzone"
"I�ve seen hundreds of these posts but I love them every time. You are most certainly correct. See it would be different if it was just warzone, because it�s free. But we paid for it. And we PAID for it. $60 base game and 10$ for each battle pass. You�d think on a game we actually had to dig deep into our wallets to acquire they wouldn�t hard promote other products smack dab in the middle of the one we paid for? Imagine buying a newer model car but every time you started it up the little screen in the middle just displayed ads for more cars for 30 seconds. Or you had an iPhone and every time you started it up it said APPLE: IPHONE 12 across the entire screen until you loaded up whatever. I hate that this is the case because it truly is so scummy and fucked up."
"Been off for a few months and decided to give MW a go again as I really enjoyed it. I'm actually dismayed at the blatant advertising for cold war and black ops. I will never try cold war or black ops and I hate warzone, so this is just annoying to me. I also wish I could be rid of warzone and be able to delete it. I find this really sad as I love MW."
"I�ve said this since day 1 of warzone being released and I�ve said every day since, even more so after Cold War dropped. Each title should be its own title. I absolutely despise the fact that they�ve intertwined all three of them. I can respect what they�re trying to do with multiple titles being implemented into warzone to reinforce longevity, but implement it into a standalone title. I�m not a fan of warzone it�s not my cup of tea so why do I have to see it advertised everywhere and why do I have to choose between the three when I boot up MW. If I wanted to play warzone I�d launch warzone, same goes for the shitty excuse of an FPS that is Cold War, and it pisses me off to no end because I swear ever since they�ve tied all three titles together and had a clusterfuck of all in game items introduced into one title MW has been less optimized and runs like utter shite for me sometimes. (And trust me it�s not the connection boys, I pay what I do for gigabit Internet for a reason) I just wish they�d stop forcing all three titles down the others� respective player base�s throats and especially not implement challenges tied to warzone it drives me mental."
"Yeah, I stopped playing the moment they integrated Cold War into Warzone.

On PC in the [Battle.app](https://Battle.app) launcher, they removed my MODERN WARFARE and instead added WARZONE.

If you look at my games list, it looks like I don't even own Modern Warfare.

I have to download WARZONE (which is required, you can't play MW without it like you could before) go into the menu and switch over to MW from there.

I've deleted the game the instant this happened, Activision  is so disconnected from its player base that it's incredible.

This was the first COD game I bought since MW2 back in the day, and I'm happy to say I won't be buying any more of them for at least another 10 years.

Fuck Activision and fuck their anti-consumer practices."
Dude really just asked if advertising/promoting is illegal
"nah, in other countries laws are different, once things are released in china, you can't start removing it, changing the name."
"I totally understand how stupid the question sounded, but I guess I meant it beyond just simple advertising/promoting. It feels like it took over the game I wanted completely. It seems shitty, but I am sure nothing actually illegal, just posing a thought. As dumb as it might be."
Yep.
What a shit ego you have to take the time to upload and post that shit to reddit. Just wanted to point it out
Cry more.
This sucks
This very well could be cheating. Hmmm.
Cheating pussy.
Lame. Fmj and general spacial awareness
Nah im not using fmj
"yeah, don�t really understand the need for internet in bot matches and campaign"

"DO NOT BUY COLD WAR!!!! That game is absolute dogshit, and the tactics used to force it down out throaths for the last few months is taken straight from some dystopian corpo playbook."
"Had a feeling that was the case, cheers"
"It will use the other half most likely. I can�t imagine it being much smaller than MW. 

As for WZ and MW they�re one but also separate; you can have WZ (for free) but you also need MW installed for it work (I think, as in an update (maybe season 5/6) they allowed pc users to choose what content they want installed bar WZ it had to be left there. Worst part is I have never nor do I want to ever play WZ) 

It�s really weird how it�s done, I was under the impression originally that WZ was a stand alone free-to-play BR, where you could just have it and it alone, but I�m unsure now. 

I probably have made it more confusing than anything, sorry, but it was my understanding which is probably wrong. Hopefully it gets done for you soon enough to start playing. Also I�m never going to buy CW either, as I tried to watch Marksman stream it and I no longer watch his stream i don�t have a good impression of the game and all the glitches I was seeing makes me think it�s a beta and I�m not willing to spend $100 on a beta."
I would say ignore cold war unless you want that type of multiplayer. MW still has a decent enough player base to keep multiplayer going for a while.
Here in South Australia we have amazing internet speeds. We�ve had this for a decade at most.
"With MW, you can remove sections you don't want to reduce its size on 'disc' once installed. 

So, once it's fully installed you can then separately remove the single player, multiplayer or even spec ops if you want. Choice is yours."
Cw only for zombies
The pick ten system is too outdated for this game.
I mean the idea is there. The 5 attachments is kind of a start to. Imagin a system where you could use only 4 attachments on each weapons and get 2 points to put on something else instead. Or running no killstreaks and get extra attachmemts. It's not a bad idea. Of course 10 considering the attachments would not be enough but advance warfare was pick 13 right?
"I think Pick-10 is *meh* depending how perks and attachments are balanced out.

IMO CW did a good thing with how everything is organized even with the wild-cards since they open more variety. With that being said and for someone who plays a lot of S&D it just the same perks over and over and over again lol"
"Pick 10 would give a lot more freedom in class creation though. The way it is right now, i will always use EOD, always use Restock, always use Shrapnel, always have C4 and always have Stims. Absolutely no variation, because that's simply the best stuff in the game, they might as well remove all other perks and equipment.

With a Pick-10-like System i could sacrifice some attachments to get Scavenger or Quick Fix for example, or sacrifice the C4s for another perk.

The way cw handled it is pretty bad imo. also always the same, just choose the extra perks wildcard and have the same 6 perks on basically all classes. And always the same equipment ofc"
This new system gives you more attachments freedom. I remember that you could literally only have 2 attachments on a gun so you have to choose carefully. They aren�t gonna change it considering cw is using it.
I stopped gaming between blops 2 - MW so unless the pick 10 was there idek what it is.
Pick ten was what blops 2 used.
"i think pick 10 is stupid. no one uses throwables or secondaries so pick 10 might as well be normal create-a-class without a pistol and grenade.

i'd rather have the option to use every part of class system and gunsmith is perfect for that"
hell yeah crappy internet gang (at least that�s what I think is happening)

"""Graphics are better"" doesn't tell us anything substantive. Maybe if you had comparison screenshots or something, someone might be able to tell you what your issue might be."
The overall colors and the sharpness of the game is better on my Asus Monitor compared to my HP one. I see it�s not an internal issue in my PC. It�s just my monitors.
Try swapping monitors and see if there�s a difference
"Yup. There was. Graphics look great with my PC, better than the PS4 Pro, but having 60FPS is a no go. I�m saving up for a better monitor anyways. I don�t know why I didn�t think of it being a monitor issue earlier."
"My rig has a 2070s in it, and after I got it I can�t play warzone on my PS4 pro anymore because of how much better it looks on my pc. Something in your settings, or like kimchee said try swapping monitors."
"Yeah, it is my monitors. I�ve been saving for a newer, better one anyways for my new build.  I�m going to play on my HP though because I cannot stand only having 60 frames."
"What panel types are your monitors? If your PC�s screen is a TN and the ps4 pro�s is an IPS it�ll look worse. 

- First things first swap the monitors as the other two have suggested. 
- go into graphics menu on cod, and find tender resolution, make sure that is set to 100. 
- thirdly in the graphics menu there is an option to re-install shaders

Try in that order."
"They�re both TN. I heard TN was the worse for colors, but the ASUS MG28UQ has pretty good colors compared to the HP omen."
"In the GFX settings on PC, make sure your Render Resolution is set to the right setting for your monitor and 100.  


Sometimes it gets set to 50 and makes everything look shit."
"MW definitely looks better on PC.

Sometimes my settings randomly change my render resolution down. You want this to be set to 100 otherwise it looks blurry af.

I like to also mess around with the nvidia filter settings to make the game a bit less whitewashed and a bit more vibrant."

Damn you afraid of the dark with that brightness level?
wait till the boogeyman gets you and you�ll see
Doesn�t the brightness give you eye strain after a while it looks like you�re playing thru a cloud
"it�s actually not this bad during the game, idk why it looks like this when recorded"
This brightness level should be illegal.
perma flashbang
I don't think you'll have to start back all over. But I've been wrong before..... You should be in double double right now. Grind. Everything should stay unlocked.
"AFAIK if you hit Level 300 and somehow reach Level 1000 with the new season you'll be reset to Level 300 for then to unlock the four additional prestiges and then be able to grind all the way to 1000 again. 

If you reach less than 300 you won't be reset since you didn't reached the highest prestige during S1. It rewards grinders and allows people to play non-stop to reach level 1000 regardless of hitting max prestige"
I don�t think it will restart but not too sure.
Your level should stay the same and still have everything you�ve unlocked so far
[deleted]
[deleted]
I just started playing after a year. I was level 1 with all my stuff still unlocked.
"Its the prestige system so i dont think your level resets either way. In all prestige games, if ur level 1000 they aren�t gonna bring you back to 1. This is no longer the modern warfare system so even if ur at level 5 and the season ends, you�ll stay at level 5."
"You won�t have to unlock any weapons or anything like that, rather the prestige level will reset.  The calling cards and icon will reflect the season, but everything you�ve unlocked stays unlocked.
The new prestige system is designed with the casual player in mind who doesn�t want to lose everything and start over from scratch."
"You get a downvote because if you�re upset that the Roze skin is too difficult to see on maps then say that�s the reason. Make a complaint about that. Just say the Roze skin creates an unfair advantage and provide evidence for your case.

But don�t try to create an uproar and use race as the issue because you feel like this will get the attention of Activision. That�s not right!"
"I like the spr its quick and you can unlock more powerful rounds, it's rare I don't kill people in one shot."
"ax 50 has good damage and decent ads speed, plus it is a lot more stylish than any marksman rifle"
AX50 the only answer.
"Spr, kar, mk2, crossbow, ax-50"
"The only marksmen is the crossbow but thats hot garbage. In the sniper class, the rytec has explosive bolts so it�s a one shot as long as you land the shot. There is also the hdr but idk if it gives hitmarkers. If you�re a normal sniper, use either the hdr or the rytec, if u quickscope, the only viable weapon is the hdr because the rytec takes an hour to scope in no matter the attachments."
This is a stupid post. There are like 4 snipers that do well with inaccurate one shot kills. Why not compare the damage to ads speed yourself in ten fucking seconds? There�s like two options but they�re entirely dependent on the damage to ADS ration that you prefer. None of us know what you like and you should have been able to determine which gun to use faster than it took to make this post.
Username checks out
"It's a bug, happens to most PS5 owners"
"Happens to me as well. I found a fix. Before you launch mw, go into your settings and toggle off connecting to the internet. Launch mw then once you are at the title screen go into settings and toggle the internet back on. This ensures that this bug will never happen to you."
It�s a sign to stop playing this buggy game
Just starting to see this with me as well. It�s extremely frustrating considering how big this game is
What exactly are you trying to show us?
"Ouch, how can live with my self. Sorry for disappointing you."
This^
Errm ok - insert waka flocka meme here
"I'm with you 100%, I had a game of kill confirmed yesterday and I had 42 tag, next on my team was 9.. people chasing damascus, which I can understand but when you see players get a kill and run past a tag it's quite frustrating"
They AVOID to take them! They run past the tags a couple cm/inches.
Well people who play kill confirmed are just tdm players who want a different mode for varieties sake tbh you shouldn't expect much.
Sometimes i get too frustrated with teammates doing fuck all on objective games and kill them myself.
Kill them until you can't kill them anymore. Then throw smoke grenades between their feet. You kill my fun? I kill yours.
"Grind is easily the worst for this. I always get just over half the team points because of my playstyle. Combine that with pointman, and I�m scoring streaks left and right (I highly suggest doing that. It is so quick). 

I don�t get how you fuck up the formula for Kill Confirmed tho. Just rush and use shotguns or SMGs (or turn your ARs into SMGs)."
Feels bad. Can't do anything about it though my guy
Only time I�m not playing to win is to do specific camo challenges
Play a mode that�s congruent to the camo challenge; don�t handicap your team�s chances because you are selfish.
I purposely equip smoke (restock as well) so I can throw it in front of the middle lane on shoot house during objective game modes to block the camper on both sides views. If you are standing right next to a point that we don�t own not capping it you are toxic as all hell.
Lol. I do this too
"That�s why I ran hardcore domination and team death match for the long shots.  Capture A or C and defend the middle lane.  When my team wasn�t playing the objective, I just stopped the flag grab but kept my grind going."
I got last place today and lost in domination on CW because our teams top player had 29 kills and 0 objectives. I had 12 objs. The most on my team.....
"I played shoot the ship with a friend the other night and just kept popping UAV's for him to drop a nuke, honestly was fun just running around with no real intention, only annoying thing was people grinding camos. 

They were at least cool about it they let us know they were trying to get camo's"
"I totally agree with you.    My teammates and irl friends only play for camos and don't care about objectives AT ALL.  Eg in grind I always have 70+ scores while the rest of them have like 2 or 5.   I just don't get it.   They mock me for being happy about my win to loss ratio but it just shows you play the game as it is meant to be.     

The sad thing is I'm ahead of them by far on the camo grind and I still play to win the game lmao.    When will those kinds of people learn?"
My teammates are the kind to ignore the obj for kills and *still* not do very well
Playing the objective gains you always more kills except kill confirmed. I at least get mostly killed because I am on my way to a tag. But everything else.... fuck just protect the hardpoint or stand in it. The same with flags on domination. The enemies come to you. Just mount anywhere near it and congratulations. You help your team and grind your worthless shit.
there is only one objective. To have fun :D
"I agree wholeheartedly with this. It's like some people actively try to let the other team win.
Nothing's worse than having to carry a team in Hardpoint cause they're doing fuck all else and avoiding the objective.
Super annoying stuff that is"
When I�m in games like that I just leave.  No point in getting killed over and over just so I can pad someone else�s stats; especially since it�s already a lost game.
Putting streaks in the air and keeping enemies off the point is nearly as important as staying on the point itself.
Play Hardcore - follow them - wait till they have 6-7 kills. shoot them. Let your team do the same. If someone runs by a flag in DOM he get shot. No once cares for useless players.
"I mean lets be honest, they're probably going for camos. It's inefficient to play the objectives if you're going for camos."
"The idea on StS is not to play the objective so the match lasts longer and you can get more of w/e you're trying to achieve per game. On other maps, yes it's annoying af."
i belive the last one is the ultimax lmg
"NOPE


They gotta just add the AWM or HK M417. Or perhaps USP. And i would have said makarov and CZ Scorpion but they are already leaked.


Gilboa snake is cool to but others look boring AF"
Double barrel Sawed off shotgun is a welcomed gun...
"Irl the QBZ-95 fires at around 650 rounds per minute, so it wouldn't make much sense for it to have a higher rate of fire ingame IMO.

Also, the FX-05 Xiuhcoatl would work better as a Blueprint for the Holger-26 (even when said gun and the G36 are completely different guns), but I wouldn't mind seeing it in a COD game.

Great suggestions!"
"Maybe in the next COD that comes out this year. I doubt we'll see much, if anything, added to the current MW."
This game already has too many guns.
The g36 is already in the game
All I wanna see is an equivalent to a black hat
"All are great suggestions, new MW2 should take in consideration"
Why no NTW 20 for maximum fan?
Well the peregrino should acomplish the role of the Antimaterial rifle but the south african NTW20 would also be nice
"For next infinity ward cod, sure, but for this game we'll at most get the Sykov, CX-9 and Raal weapons that are already in parts of the game, at some point in the future. After those weapons we're not getting anything more for this game."
Good suggestions.   There are new guns and operators coming in S2.    Look it up.  Some guns are quite dope
"No, that�s a battle pass skin, so it�s not possible to get"
"Shite, so the black outfit was a special f�r the Roze operator and was only available to get via the S5 battle passes ?"
Trying to abuse the broken POS Rook skin eh? No luck for you.
Get the frogman udt skin
someone called me out for hacking because people dont understand thermites counter shields
Yeah thermites are gods greatest gift
Termites are useful for so many reasons
"I used to run only thermite but then got into Warzone and c4 was king. Now that it feels like my 3rd grade sister is throwing the c4 I�m back on thermites and I wish I never left. 

They are so much fun.

Toss them at a riot shield and enjoy. 

Some men truly just wanna watch the world burn."
I generally outsmart them with thermites
Thermites are great but I like messing with frag richocet a lot haha
If someone runs a shield I just run explosive crossbow and my only goal becomes kill shield boi
"Bruv. I don't want to run the shield, but damascus requires it lmao"
My favorite opponents are those who use Semtex or crossbow to counter my shield. I love watching them commit forced suicide as I run at them.
Crossbow gang represent
99% of shield players just on the Damascus grind and hate playing it just as much if not more than you hate them for playing it
that�s so true
true
I hated playing on shield that I simply asked shipment players to help me in exchange for helping them as well on camo grind.
ya I can�t remember the last time I saw someone using a gold shield except for CYA in Shipment
Im calling bullshit that was lucky
Wouldn't have had to if you didn't dump your whole mag into the wall >:)
LOL you�re not wrong dude I know it�s just words but if it justifies my case I�m a pc player that was forced to use a ps4 during the time I got that clip hahaha
Shielders hate me
I usually try to throw C4 behind them on the wall and detonate it.
*panek*
Yes and no?
You just panicked there. No outsmarting at all
[deleted]
"I remember I did this once, in hard point some guy was back against the wall with a riot shield. So when I went into where the hard point was, he popped out of of the corner, he hit me once and I was almost dead so I cooked a grenade, threw it to my feet, and I legged it to the door, and he tried to do the same but his shield slowed him down which was his downfall. I remember hearing �Aaa your a bitch� in the death chat."
i hate riot shields just as much as the next guy. but ppl running around with thermites is why i will never have damascus
"Its a slow n painful process lol. People in shoot the ship will generally help you out with it, they understand the struggle.
Best tip i can give, find another shielder, and ask in game chat if theyre going for damascus too. 9 times out of 10 theyll meet you in office for some triple kills"
I prefer the Molotov to get the job done.
Made a bunch of CoD4 videos back in the day. Hype to get back into it! Had to shake a lot of rust off to get clips worthy of a video lol
"If your launchers aren't max level yet go around shipment and melee with them, and shoot the corners of the map with the JOKR, also I'd suggest getting the riot shield gold first because it'll lower your KD and get you into easier lobbies"
Thanks for that... since we still have Shoot the Ship... for now.
"No the best way to get ur weapon leveled is to use it to do contracts in plunder. 5-6 matches fully leveled up with xp token

Edit: then go into sts and ground war to finish"
"I played a lot of Ground War during the launcher grind ... But the developers have only made it more difficult since you can't resupply rockets from ammo crates anymore. Ultimately, I found Free-for-all mode to be a big help shooting down personal radars."
"Got mine at saturday, i wasted so much time with Obsidian for ODEN, SCAR, AK, AMAX, AUG, STRIKER, P90, AN94, ASVAL, SA87, X16, M19, 1911, RENETTI, PILA and RPG.

Shield was hard, but HC Shipment DOM and a bunch of good People (CORE Player dont like to help, idk why) helps a lot. Just ask :-)

JOKR is also hard, i did the most of it in Groundwar + MunBox Fieldupgrade. Hardpoint CORE for attac/defender works great.

&#x200B;

Funfact: Holger was my first Goldweapon ;-D

\#lockdown"
"Yea  sometime I just let  the shield guy kill me, esp of they chat ask."
"Just play normal matches and everytime you hear ""enemy personal radar"" blow it up ASAP. I've done all my launchers via 90% personal radar"
"Pray for people using personal radar, and also tons of shipment, rust, or close range matches."
"Upgrading weapons in plunder when there�s no shipment is probably the fastest way, when there�s shipment sit on a flag or hardpoint and get kills for double xp per kill. Obviously pop a double xp token when you need"
if the XP's still work.  Yea I was doing that with the RPG seems easiest one first.  But looking over the Camo challenges you have to kill a lot of vehicles.  Why I'm thinking WZ and GW... oof!
For the lanchers  i found that the fastest way is just shoot the ship hardcore.U only need to kill 75 cuav's and personal  radars.Dont shoot downn anything else u dont need to.For the shield iff u dont havve the sanity to go through all this just go inn the 1v1 playlist and ask kinndly the opponent to help u with the challenges.If u havent max lvld the launchers go to plunder because u dont need to waste time killing people on multi player and i found that with double weaponn  xp u need smthing like 20-25 contracts to max lvl 1 launcher.Good luck brother i only have the strela left see you in the damascus club
Cool... yeah during one of the times we had 1v1 Me bro I had a guy with a shield jumping up and down ... so I let him kill me and he let me take long shots. Wholesome teaming LOL.   Oh yeah after learning how to survive more that 3 seconds in HC it's about all I play unless there's a fun playlist like Snipers only or 1v1 Me Bro.
be prepared for some toxic shock syndrome lol
I may go into a discord. I�ll at least have a discord set up on standby.
"Netcode and time to kill are literal trash in this game, can't prepare you for that.

That's the thing that shocked me was being killed instantly be pre-aimers around corners"
both are rather good though. The delay caused by netcode is on line with other shooters and the ttk is mostly on the slightly slow to average side (a bit slower than bo2).
[deleted]
"Hardly call that camping.

Went outside, killed the first guy, circled back to take a flank, noticed someone on the radar, doubled back but they were gone (likely crawled up to the upper level to ambush me - which he did) killed him, went back down to take the flank again and killed another, noticed someone spotted me behind, turned back to shoot him but missed the mark. It�s not like I was in the corner waiting for these guys, they just all happened to come to the same point."
"I'm on the same boat, cant finish the freaking skulls!"
Place a skulls camouflage on that shield.  It tells people like me you�re grinding and I�m happy to help.
I got lucky and a few enemies spotted me and gave me some free kills! I tried other modes but in the end was 90 percent done on HC shoot the ship
"Use the room with the wall in the office on shoothouse , just keep doing circles around that. Claymore each door with restock on. Cancerous way to play but so many people will keep rushing back to get you haha. Have the claymore down because with so many people running eod you'll only need one hit and also a trophy system as your upgrade so people can't flash/stun"
"I got riot shield and knife gold as early as I could. I knew riot shield was gonna be horrible and it was. Knife is a lot more fun since you're way faster.

If you're not great with snipers, try get them out the way too, or launchers. I haven't done the launchers yet tho cause I've just been putting it off. But I did finish snipers today. Now I'm levelling my pistols and then probably LMG's, then imma do the camos for marksman rifles.

That's a big one out of the way tho!"
"I've done all snipers marksman and melee, was just doing them for plat originally but now they are out the way I might try Damascus. Sounds like your well on your way!"

They still haven�t fixed the spawn trap at aniyah palace?
"Oh never lol, next to Promenade it's the worst GW map simply because that side can be spawn trapped so bad"
"Is that a RAM you�re using? If not/so, what�s your load out ?"
"Yeah it was, I was running it with the monolithic, commando, 50 round, stippled grip, and holo sight. Pretty fast killing AR."
"Man, you're having my luck. Though most of the times i actually die from something really stupid liek a stun or rpg direct hit across the map"
"Nice game and nice bgm, whats the name of it?"
Thanks man. Music is called Frightening Notion by Dream Cave
"Ah the ole tgd spot
Edit: do people really think the ram is that hard to control that you have to have a Cronus max?"
"Dang man, you're insane.

I've never even had a nuke"
Is this ground war mode? Great clip!
Appreciate it and it is!
WHY would you use hardline in specialist mode??
So you get your 4th perk on first kill which could double in an op category like spawning with double time & quick fix taking effect after first kill (same time it would anyways) plus specialist bonus is 7 kills not 8.
Instead of getting a 6th perk at 6 kills you get all your perks and the specialist bonus at 7 kills. Just a trade off I like to do.
Settle down
I feel bad for the other team more then I feel good for this high kill spawn trap footage.
does the ram really not have any recoil wtf is that a chronus
"It�s got some recoil, just pull down and to the right to counter it. Affected FOV also makes your recoil look smaller for any gun"
it is a laser beam
"wouldn't doubt it, the basic ram has a shitton of horizontal recoil"
He's on pc
"I hate these people spawn trapping others for these stupid clips and nukes and such

Man you are just ruining the game for others 
Well done for that you big ....."
I got a gunship in 1.15 min.... it was in rust (and I used a wheelson) so not impressive

Yep.
And now my tinfoil hat comes out? Is this just another way of them fucking with us to buy that other game we clearly don't want to play ...
Yup. Once a week maybe.
Almost every time I launch the game.
"Mine often changes the render resolution down to below 100. Not everytime, but very frequently."
Only done that twice since I started playing last year and that feeling when you clutch is so good!
Daaaaang
Soooo that was you...rebel scum
U can pick loadouts in this? I assume everyone runs AS Val then?
Suprisingly no. Most people go to a sniper 1v1 as it is the normal thing to do in that mode. There's always that guy with MP7 or some shit tho.
Lmao I love this
haha thank you
"Using snipers just isn�t that much fun anymore. Sure when I was 12 it was a blast on mw2. Now it�s boring and easy. I whip out the most toxic load out I can and wait for the hate to start coming. 

The unspoken rule to use a sniper is boring. I�m here to have fun, not follow some rule."
More power to ya.
"Highest I�ve gotten was around 160 on HP. I�m sure there�s better than mine, as well."
The most I've gotten was 152 in HC Domination on shipment
highest ives gotten is 134 i believe in hc dom
"I barely ever play Shipment, but if i do, i usually get 100+. I think my highest was 140? not sure"
"Highest I got was 149 HC dom. GG to you, btw."
"Thanks bud, lol guess i have to play a bit harder"
Yeah my highest is maybe 119 or something.     I guess it depends on the lobbies.   Not to be mean but with sbmm you sometimes get bot lobbies (even though they are not bots) and pop off.
"Yeah i know what you mean, you arent mean dont worry, ive had bot lobbies worse than this where a guy opened a clip on my back missed every shot and i killed him and he raged so fucking hard i couldnt help but laugh, we have a few of those esp in SA"
Yeah I had 130 something the other day. Another guy on my team had 89 and another 70 kills. The other team refused to back out and they were like 12-85. I couldn�t have sat there and died a million times.
"Nah, I gotta call bullshit on that."
"Lol swear its legit, the shit thing is i really thought i was playing the game mode, when i realised it, those last probably 5-10 seconds were the final point"
Not bullshit you just need a party to play with
Why? Because you've never broken 100 on shipment yourself? It's possible. Me and several others in this thread alone.
"this was on tournament, i was having so much fun on there. now it's gone.. :("
should of shot his body to make sure hes dead
It�s most likely a glitch that these challenges are even showing. This skin for Wyatt was like S2 or S1 and you needed to purchase the BP for it so I�ll doubt they�d just want players to earn it for free.
"Yeah I figured that out, I appreciate the response"
"It's a bug that's been around for about 3 weeks. You'll notice Wyatt is not the only one with missions that suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

THEY CANNOT BE DONE. Visual bug that you can even see it."
Did you choose Coalition as your favorite side? So that your chosen coalition operator will be the one walking in the menu?
"I think ive learned there�s no actual challenge, it was from season one and it�s popping up again for some reason, but thanks for responding!"

This doesn�t guarantee protection though. Many people had 2FA and still had their account stolen.
"Trust me, you have a drastically reduced chance of getting hacked with 2FA. If a hacker is getting past 2FA it is more likely a loophole/bug or specifically targeted attack."

"This sadly isnt a reactive solution... Enabling these security features is to help prevent a hack, not solve the issues that come from a hack."
There is a Google Authenticator app too for android I am using it for my Activison account.
"wouldnt it be better to get your blizzard account hacked rather than activision? cuz all your game progress is tied to your activision account. Only the fact that you bought the game is toed with blizzard. i think if only blizzard gets hacked, you can make a new account and buy the game again, but still have all your data when u log in through your activision account. This is all assuming the hacker for some reason doesnt go after your activision account"

"In my opinion, they should have never combined all 3 games (I know they aren't actually combined) but I only care about playing MW, if I wanted to play warzone I would much prefer to download a separate game file, I have no intention of buying or playing Cold War so why is it that every time I load MODERN WARFARE I start on the option for Cold War. I would much rather have MW be a separate game entirely and go boot up another game file if I wanted to play WZ or CW. One last thing that irritates me is the fact that I don't play warzone at all but while I'm playing MW I get unlocks and skins for warzone that I cant even use in MW."
You know the best part? At least on PS4. When you own MW and CW if you open MW then select cold war in the 3 way menue it actually gives you a warning that it's closing the game to opens the cold war app...which is a different app. So all along the only reason cold war is in the MW menue is to spam advertisment for CW cause it dosen't actually use the same launcher. I would laugh if it wasn't such a miserable attempt to sell their trash game. When you pay full price for a game you shouldn't get advertisment spam. And that goes for the cold war battlepass featured in modern warfare as well.
"The integration was never a bad idea, it was just poorly handled. 
 
The most they should've done was integrate cold war and warzone. Like just cold war and warzone. The only thing mw should've done integration wise was allow people to rank up their battle pass. Everything else was just kind of overkill. 
 
I blame warzone over anything else. It needs to be treated as a separate game. From the start it should've been treated as a separate game."
It's literally been like this since day one
"Since day one of Mw2019....or BOCW? Because once BOCW came out, didn't play MW, played that to about level 22, wasn't a fan and didn't touch MW until today and lo and behold, the season 2 changes came and...it's fucked MW entirely"
"Progression from MW, WZ, and CW are all linked if you ever got to 55 in MW you will have everything unlocked already and any xp you earn goes to your season levels and prestige just like CW. In a couple of days when the season resets you will be level 1 of your highest prestige across all 3 games."
"Dude it�s not letting me play anymore, just says playlist updating FOREVER.  Wtf is this just me?"
You gotta reinstall unfortunately the same happened to me
"Try plunder, it does give you quite a fair amount of exp. Just do contracts over and over. Recommend the capture the point contracts."
What a rude bitch tho
Dude literally having the same problem right now can�t even get into a match I keep getting pushed back into the loading screen
Yeah its terrible
Gunfight Tournaments are easy
Yeah. They are. That has literally nothing to do with this post.
I would say it doesn't have any cool effect as it was added before obsidian camo was introduced to the game. They never went back and added effects to old blueprints just some of the new ones
"Okay, thank you"
I�ve seen an obsidian white light and it�s all blacked out.
I'm like 99% sure obsidian covers the entire weapon in black no matter attachments or blueprint.
"Obsidian also doesn�t cover all of the blueprint on the Anole MP5 blueprint, so it looks like a sick blue and black obsidian. So kinda, it does completely cover MOST of the blueprints in MW."
"There are some blueprints in which obsidian does not, actually. There's an AUG blueprint in which the obsidian covers most of the gun and applies the obsidian texture on a certain part of the while keeping the original color. Here's a photo.
https://i.redd.it/tp4nfc9wppv51.png"
Sunspot has a CHANCE but I�m not sure... I know that obsidian on the M4 with the 4th of July skin has a cool blueish sheen in with obsidian. So sunspot might have an orangish one...
This is one thing I wish they did better... blueprint accents remain over camo
"Personally I think they should have left her face covered, adds to the mystery in the game I guess.

Always thought of her as Nikto's female counterpart"
Her and nikto should have a wedding. Only people who have the black roze skin unlocked can attend.
"Exactly, why can�t the girls have a faceless operator as well."
"It's worse than I expected, lmao."
Think is worth it?
For real xD
To me she looks beautiful
Love the hair!
"She looks fine, but apparently everybody here is a handsome 6'4 tall ripped guy"
"She looks good, but ig ppl here expects her to look like a supermodel or something"
"Aight, I'ma simp out"
this gives me hope that activision might release the soap bundle sometime this year
They�ll drop Soap and Sparks without a mention like they did with this but who knows when
"She looks like Katy Perry tbh, was imagining her to look more like Salter from IW."
"@AprilNicol is the lady your after, Jamie Gray Hayder (Salter) voices her the body model is April Nicol"
Should just release the blond skin. It's the only one we want
Which one ?
None of the sweats are going to switch over
I am decepcionated i believe that roze was blonde and  pretty  but no i feel  cheated : (
Shit literally won�t show up in the store for me. And it�s been a week. I even looked at the M13 store options and it doesn�t come up. Like wtf.
Same with TacGas try MW Multiplayer
Imagine paying for this.
"Imagine paying for any mtx after seeing the amount of game breaking bugs, glitches and cheaters theres been"
"oh


that�s


not good"
If the game hadn�t gone to shit and I still played it regularly I�d probably get this
A true masterpiece.
"I have one scored to ""out of my league"" by Fitz + Tantrums"
"That Riot shield and Obsidian 725 is such fucking cheese. Over all though, the concept and the clips where pretty good. Nothing too over the top like 360 no-scopes every other clip too."
What is this though?
With cross play you�ll find matches in every game mode
It sure is. I play hardcore all the time. Easy to find lobbies
Games not that old lol
Very much so
It�s the best of the new call of duties by a landslide so yeah
"Very possible, it�s still heavily played."
Its still fun ! I just played some ground war and I had a blast!
Game is very VERY active. People prefer it over CW.
"Cold War was a very hot sell but a lot of players have come back to mw. The game is still extremely active community-wise, on the developer side, not so much."
"Finding games is actually easier than BOCW. 

You can now enable 2FA on your activision account, after which account stealing is not a big problem."
"My rig is running hot GPU (Nvidia 1070 Founders)  most evenings!  It's still alive and well or as said before "" I'm not dead yet!""  

Rumors now there's some new content coming soon, too.  Hope, hope."
Yes definitely. I just played it. I instantly found a match.
More active than Cold War.
Re: accounts being stolen Activision has enabled two-factor authentication so that should keep your account safe so long as you do it.
I think cold war had a good campaign but the multiplayer was a disappointment and it shows on ps as one of the first online games to buy
"Still very very active but it would be wise to wait for the last update of this game to comes and for the game to be finalized for good so it�s will a stable experience. Usually after the update it takes them a long ass time to iron out all the glitches and bugs. And no, although very active, matchmaking with exotic gamemode has been taking a toll since CW. But you can still instantly have a full TDM, DOM, HQ, HP, FFA lobby."
"This video shows how crazy the C4 range was. I remember when they nerfed the C4 it seemed like they went overboard. But in hindsight, the throwing range was insane; we just got used to it"
Seeing him huck that c4 effortlessly definitely shows how needed the nerf was overdue.

Domination on Hardcore
My favourite was a game mode I only ever saw for one week. I can�t remember what it�s called but it involved one person getting and holding a flag but everyone on the other team could then see where that person was. That was awesome and I played it non stop for the week it was available. Unfortunately I haven�t seen it since.
Oh wait wait I know that one! That one was so much fun
It's part of the playlist for shoot the ship! Though I haven't managed to play it on any other maps but I'd imagine they'd be a bit easier to play tactically on than shipment.
You can find it in the shoot the ship playlist
"Defender was the mode, sometimes it pops up on the dedicated map of the week in core.  I�ve seen it a few times on shipment this past week and it�s a blast."

I�ll be inviting viewers to 1v1 me on twitch if you�re interested.  My tiktok is kbacTV too if you�re into warzone and cod clips. A follow on either would be much appreciated also!
Well the game uses an Activision account so progress carries over all platforms. There shouldn't be any issue switching from PC to PS4 and playing on both of them. Edit: I'm tired so if that didn't help my bad.
All the time gotta get another mask to fix it
"HDR for the longest ranges, Kar for highest mobility and intermediate ranges, AX-50 as a middle ground between the two."
The Rytec just being absolutely neglected
"It should be, cuz it�s a pos. Like really, they fucked it up even in the realism department. The Barrett M82 simply doesn�t have the kind of recoil like the Rytec has. It should have been the totally opposite, the Rytec should have been the lowest recoil and most poweful sniper rifle in the game. I have seen marine dual-weilding two Light Fifty and somehow this game with top-notch operators can�t handle a Light Fifty�s kick."
"Damnnnnnn I forgot about the rytec ngl I like it, but just really wanted to see the most used sniper rifles and marksmen."
"The kar, but if I had to pick a legit sniper and not a marksman I would say the ax50"
Dragnov lmao
All I see are 2 snipers and 2 cheesy ass guns that work like snipers
"Kar takes skill, but SPR is insanely cheesy i�ll admit."
Exactly. AX50Gang!!!!
"SPR, as if there is even a contest."
Rytec
Carbine >>
"carbine is a marksman rifle not a sniper, it can be built as a sniper but even irl most lever actions wouldn't match the range of even a R700"
"SPR feels the best to me, but on larger maps, I prefer the Kar.

HDR isn�t bad, but it�s really not the best unless you�re on ground war or camping a lane on a map.

AX-50 was the only sniper I genuinely liked to use no attachments on. For some reason it was really fun to me. Saving the AX-50 for my last weapon to get gold so I can do a trickshot.

Don�t get me wrong, all of them are good, but some are better for other purposes. This is how I use them.

SPR for close range encounters with fast ADS

Kar-98 for close to mid range encounters with slightly slower ADS

AX-50 for mid to long range encounters with decent ADS

HDR for long range encounters with abysmal ADS"
Why isn't the Rytec here?
"love the R700 but built like a sniper, none of that short barrel no scope bullshit"
"AX50 is best but HDR feels so good in hands.. HDR shooting sound no scoping everything feels very very satisfying..

spr is a aimbot gun that automatically locks my aim on someone

kar98 the most balanced gun in my opinion.. hitbox range firerate feels balanced to me

reytec feels super satisfying to shoot

dragunov is just a better kar98(with sniper scope) In my opinion

Modern warfare snipers are awesome"
"So far my favourite is the AX-50. The kar is pretty damn good too though, and HDR was decent."
"the AX-50 basically always one shots. 

I also see alot of people sayin g the Barrett is bad in the game, Well, yeah it is, what do you expect from a semi auto .50 caliber sniper rifle? Its slow and has a slower velocity but a truly good sniper would know how to use it and wreck shop."
I think the LW3 Tundra is the best and there's no contest.
I'm pretty sure OP is talking about MW multiplayer
"Dude .... Your team wasn't doing shit, hahaha"
DOGE TAKS
I have no solutions for ya bud but I still play MW multiplayer and by seeing them in the MW store I just presumed they could be used in MW! What a sly move on there part...
"I exclusively play MP, but i was fine with it only being able to be used in warzone, and I presumed warzone and modern warfare MP were the same game. What baffles me is how they manage to sell something that spans across three different game titles without any warning or reminder for the consumer."
"try to refund any way possible, bank, ps store, anything. Damn i feel truly bad for you. I think they should give you a warning screen whenever you purchase a thing you cannot access"
"Thanks, I�ll definitely try with my bank. Will never buy anything from activision again"
To use it in warzone you need to make a pre made class in normal multiplayer and copy it into warzone loadouts and it works mate
"That I can deal with, what I can�t deal with is I�m
Missing the watch, stickers and emblem I bought. And the fact that the items I did receive are spread across 2 different games that I don�t have full access of"
"And you didn't mentioned: Others platforms will see your skin as a CDL base skin (the grey one without the team colors), you are the only one who sees correctly. Ask your friends to tell you what they see.

I got scammed too"
"Day 6 of trying to connect with activision support, still no response"

"I have had something similar, but it made it make a new Activision account. I�ve had no luck with support for 4 months. I was also ignored for a while, until I filed a BBB complaint. Then magically I wasn�t ignored anymore. Though, it still hasn�t been solved, I haven�t heard anything in a few weeks, and I will be filing another complaint if they don�t get back to me soon."

"I�m in the same boat, this is an absolute fuck on I�ve been trying to get my account back. activision suppprt is so fucking shitty that I give up on the game now, I spent lots of money and was about level 500 all now just gone cause a multi million dollar company cba to spend anything on a anti cheat so that their loyal customers of over 12 years get hacked and lose everything.

"You were hacked, and they unlinked your PSN ID and linked their own, stealing all your progress, unlocks, and purchases.

Make a new Activision account(this will be temporary), USE A DIFFERENT EMAIL ADDRESS than the original(they don't tell you that, but I think it works better), and tell them everything you can- like the date it happened, your original email, PSN ID, any other linked account IDs.

If you are lucky, they will find your account, relink your ID and give you access, while deactivating the new temp account you made.  If you are unlucky, like I am, the thief will have added 2FA to your account, so you will have it back on your console but not be able to  access it to change passwords, link or unlink other accounts, and so on.

Check in the settings I am pretty sure there�s something under general or something like that
"No, there's not. Thanks for speculating but if you don't know an answer with more confidence probably just don't reply (pretty sure lol). I was sure I had looked there several times before but did again after your post. Nope. Nothing. At least not on PS4."
"Man its bullshit! on PC they have in-game option to appear offline while me on ps4 have been trying to do that for a year, nothing works!!

Please tell me if it works for you"
Yah it doesn't work. I have tried so many times. Also there is no option in the 'general' menu or whatever that guy said. It is really dumb. Seems like a total lack of privacy. They have these settings on Activision.com but changing them does NOTHING. Does not inspire confidence in Activision.
I�m gonna take this with a grain of salt giving if it�s a leaker who is accurate or not I�m not gonna jump on it and be all happy
This sub bounces on everything that TGR says as divine word. Until it happens I�m not believing it
will there be an MW battlepass?
I don�t think so
"I'm interested to know as well. Because from what I could tell with the CW integration, your rank is now tied directly to CW progression. Maybe this was a temporary feature and will be removed to have the MW 55-155 rank return in the event of the return of the MW Battlepass feature."
Hey guys! This guy here.....he talks sense.
"I hope so, but I also doubt it. All three new guns are unlocked via challenges. Usually it would be 2 in the battle pass and one mid season from a challenge"
"I doubt it. The two leaked operators, Soap and Sparks, have bundles already. They each have the Cx9 and the sykov respectively in their bundles. The RAAL MG, however, is probably going to have it's own bundle leaked at the beginning of the ""season"" which will most likely be a big content drop labeled ""season 7"" without a battle pass"
I hope there's at least some MW skins and blueprints in the battle pass along with cold war stuff
"Of course there will be, more money for activision."
I hope it's just a simple good old content update available freely to everyone and not a grind through a battle pass or other expensive bundle.
"Hope not, or at the very least hope they don't lock Soap behind the pass OR at the very least don't make it so you have to play 24/7 to reach level 100 and don't remove it before you finish the pass itself."
"Don't do that, don't give me hope...."
Lol
the best news of 2021 they should bring back Terminal
"Terminal, Dome & Mission, then this game will be complete... and Highrise too"
They�re probably saving all the mw2/3 maps for the sequel in 2022
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT, YES. MW has been the best COD for years and I�m so happy we may get more content. 

This is gonna be the best birthday present EVER."
I agree. Wodern Marfare kicks ass.
M for minnie W for wumbo
"It truly is, in my opinion. I thought NO OTHER COD would beat MW2 for me..... But modern warfare did it!"
"yh as someone who hated on the game like crazy and still has the same issues with it its wayyyyyy better than cold war, not even close. Even with the problems i have its a great cod"
"Haha mine is on March 9th, I'll be sure to wish you a happy cake day on the 11th. I'll memorize to do it bro !"
"It�s kind of crazy. I took like a 9 month break and recently got back on the grind with some buddies for mw and Warzone that are still going strong.

Each one of them plays basically Warzone exclusive and when I asked them about the new guns they said they don�t care or you can unlock them in Warzone as NONE of them bought Cold War. This one dude spends his paycheck on every single skin available, how bad do you have to fuck up a game to not get his money?

Anyway I�m getting back into it.

See you scholars out there in search and destroy. Thank you btw I know that you banged my mom. Make her happy!"
Circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk
"Please manage expectations. This is a leak, not an official announcement. It's just as likely this is completely bogus."
The campers rejoice for MW.
Holy shit hope this is true
Terminal fans punching the air rn
"Terminal? I think that they Will not bring back terminal,unfortunely"
"everyone is just coming back to this post to share their disappointment lol

&#x200B;

^(ok i'm here for that reason too)"
I�m here for the I told you so tour. So many people were downvoted to oblivion for calling this noodle necked larper out.
"haha, I get it. I'm disappointed too. Facepalm. Was playing last night and said to myself I wish they'd release the new content cuz Cold War is not my thing."
"To anyone doubting this, TGR's leaks are basically the reason MW and onward have no supply drops, and he has very reliable sources, although I don't think it will actually be a season 7, just a big content drop"
"I agree, don�t know how they would integrate two battle pass systems going on at the around the same time. They�re are plenty of unreleased executions and a few character skins that have yet made it into the shop."
"I was personally done with getting battle passes as as soon as CW bamboozled me into buying theirs, so I'll just use my cod points to get the Velika operator bundle."
???????
This didn�t age well.
I just want a Price skin and Soap. That�s all I want.
[removed]
"It can't put you in the same maps if you never quit to begin with. Just finish the match, take the loss, and get a new map. That or switch game modes."
"But the game only wants you to finish it, probably better off not quiting next time and just taking the L"
"I unlocked the Sykov on MP but nothing. I got the clip on my PS4 right now. If I�m not mistaken. The Sykov looks like a makarov pistol, correct? Cuz it doesn�t show up"
"Yeah, the Sykov is supposed to be the makarov and the CX-9 is supposed to be the Scorpion Evo. I just want to be able to use them"
Prett sure they�ll be added in S2 of warzone.
"They are fully functional even on MP, you can have a chance of spawning them with Weapon Drop field upgrade"
"Don't get your hopes up at this point. People don't seem to realize that corporations will just abandon products like nothing if any combination of sales analysts or suits decide higher profits might be had working on something new. The ugly truth is that they're probably right. That's why they have that job. The tradeoff is always a damaged relationship with a specific group of consumers - those who already paid for the game. They're basically saying ***""fuck you, I already have your money""*** in not so many words.

Nothing we've seen in terms of updates and seasons gives us a clue as to what they will do with the new weapons (seems like only playlists get updated about half as often as during the MW seasons).

I think the most likely answer is that devs were told to continue building weapons for new MW seasons up until the point where the weapons were half-added to the game in anticipation of a new season, but then were told to just shut it down and work on something else, either CW or the next title for their specific studio out of the 3 that produce COD titles. I suspect the global season progress design decision had something to do with that."
"Yeah, I feel like that's what they're probably doing. Sucks ass that they're doing that to a COD I've actually come to enjoy compared to their latest ones. I'm just hoping they don't fully abandon it and add some more to it."
I feel like they do this to get free testing for these guns. They'll be released some time season 2 IMO.
They�re supposedly coming out in March according to leaks
It is a makarov
Can you unlock CX-9 in hardcore mode?

So the rumors are true.
"Almost every other game I get into, It doesn't even let me spawn in"
That happens to me too. I think it's from players backing out too much
Yes it�s fun when they don�t leave after a few kills or when they leave seconds before the game starts in the pre lobby and I have to wait and back out
"Well, I think they're going to continue the story from MW 2019. And I hope they do. What they have done with the revamped characters and the new ones is amazing. I love the gameplay, the doors, the gunplay, everything about Modern Warfare. I can't wait to see where they take the gang after the events of Warzone. We'll be getting Soap and I'm sure many more characters to come."
"They are for sure continuing the story, Hadir is still alive."
Hell yes. I just want the amazing gameplay mechanics to return.
"Imagine if treyarch just used mw�s engine, it probably would have been just as good, maybe better with the maps in black ops"
"They should�ve just did that and then they could�ve just made different maps, changed the speed of the characters movement stuff like that. Would�ve been amazing"
Not to mention that it would have made the Warzone integration way easier.
I just wish they put the same effort into their gun models and attachments. I�m pretty interested in history so I was excited to see the detail on those older guns after MW did it so well
"It doesn't make sense from a $ standpoint to keep the best game (this one) active like RB6.  They want to cash in all those purchases of $60 a pop instead of make a longer lasting, excellent game that all the playerbase would enjoy."
True
"when MW was announced, IW said that other studios can use the new engine so i don�t understand why CW uses the old shitty engine. MW has set the bar."
"i'm putting my trust in IW for their next game which i hope is MW2. MW2019 revived my interest in call of duty after quitting when ghosts came out.

it seems treyarch played to the ""nostalgic"" type of players that want the same gameplay and shit from the older games while IW is the one innovating and improving the quality of the franchise. MW felt fresh and while it did have many problems, IW's on the right path. 

cold war isnt necessarily a bad game, it just isnt a step forward in any regard. theres nothing innovative about it, or memorable.

what i want IW's next game to be is take everything they did right with MW, and make it better, while taking all the bad shit out like map quality, hackers, and meta weapons being OP the whole life cycle and whatever else people disliked most.

then we'll have the best cod ever released."
"Yes - I just know whatever they do for there next game, it�s gonna build off the great things they did for MW2019, and learn off the bad things. 

I�d be down for a ghosts 2 or just MW 2. I think MW2 would be the way to go cus they revamped all these characters and stuff"
Thank you. I regret ever joining the BOCW reddit. This is utter facts.
"Ho boy an other PC player that thinks aim assist is basically aim bot. M&K is far superior to controller even considering aim assist. Unless you are extremely good at controller aiming the reaction time and precision you have with a mouse is just better. Aim assist barely does anything. If you get claped by controllers you need to get better at mouse and keybord. It's not free wins. 

Also keep in mind you switched to PC last year. You play against people that have played controller their whole life. That and you play against kids that have nothing else to do than go to school and play cod."
Not to mention the aim assist is scuffed in this game
Ho boy? Did you just read the title?... can you read?
"Dude, just get better with kbm."
"I am a legend at kbm, read the damn post."
What the fuck
[PROOF OF AIM ASSIST DOMINANCE](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
"It's not about being a good player or a bad player, it has nothing to do with aim assist either.

You're just discovering the effects of SBMM and you look like you don't want to take the red pill...  
I've read the whole text now. Of course the time you spend in other games won't be 100% helpful even if the game has the same ""title"".  
I agree with lobbies, and if you want authentic human connection try Battlefield 1, it was before all this gaudy cosmetics craze."
"I don�t think you are getting old buddy. You should consider that even though MW19 and MW2 are both CoD�s, they are entirely different games.

That means you shouldn�t go into MW19 thinking it�s going to be anything like MW2. Though you may be a veteran at MW2 you can still be a total noob at MW19.

If you want to do well at a different game, you may need to do something different.
Different loadouts/different playstyles etc.

The biggest difference between MW19 and MW2 is SBMM. Skill based matchmaking, means that you are being matched with enemies that are just as good as you, so basically even if your skills improve, your enemies will improve too.

This means that you can�t rely on your skills to earn kills anymore. Your skills aren�t going to be the advantage that win you fights anymore, because everyone is just as skilled.

You need to press the strategy advantage instead of relying on the fact that you are better than your opposition.
You need to outsmart your opponents in other words.

That�s just my advice. Do with that what you will."

"You mention being on PC and aim assist being too strong.
Drift0r already debunked that right here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/gxbad0/aim_assist_mw/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)"
"You�re right about everything except KBM vs controller. The whole aim assist shit just isn�t true, but I agree with everything else. The reason this game isn�t enjoyable is because it goes against everything the previous cods taught you, like pushing and being aggressive. Cod4 rewarded you for pushing and having good gun skill. MW rewards you for just sitting in a corner with a claymore at each entrance. The game caters to shitters, which is why so many of the people still playing this dogshit game defend it tooth and nail because it�s the first game they can actually do somewhat �well� in. Because it caters to dogshit players, and SBMM protects them from actual good veteran players. Tbh modern warfare is the worst cod ever made. Cold War is better, but it�s boring as fuck because there�s virtually no content, and season 1 was a snore fest. And I was hoping for K-9 unit in season 2, but instead we get a dumb ass death machine, and other re-skinned bullshit. Cod is about to fall hard, activision is about to go back to struggling to please their shareholders, which hopefully means we�ll get the MW2 multiplayer remastered that activision is holding onto for a rainy day, when none of the new games are pleasing anyone. I�d honestly get MW2, even if it�s bundled with a shitty cod game like how MW remastered was. The new cods are just pure trash."
"Agreed. You are on my wavelength. It�s really hard to describe what we are describing. I just play nuke town 24/7 on Cold War, but that gets old FAST, and the maps on cold war are dog water."
"I love this attitude.

Last night I had a similar experience. I was mounted on Shoot House, and suddenly I heard/saw someone wildly meleeing me (with no damage). I dismounted and looked over to see one of my teammates wearing the same, relatively rare skin (Wyatt�s The Fixer from Sicario) and trying to get my attention. So we jumped up and down and crouched and then went on about our business.

Little moments, bro."
"That reminds me! There was a dude bonking people with his riot shield, and I kept going after him because that�s what you do. He messaged me mid-match saying �listen, before you get mad at me, just know I�m doing my challenges, so I�m sorry.�"
"Same. I've been on the braindead obsidian grind, and meeting wholesome and nice players makes it so much better."
"I loved the few matches me and my friend played against non-cancerous players in the tournament, we won against a team 6-2 and when they said ""GG"" I responded with ""GG, good luck with your next one"" and then after me and my guy and had won, one of them whispered to me that they won it as well!

Nice work, guys."
"As long as you have fun, right?"
I was on. Appreciated !
"Saturday night was a blast, great lobbies"
good times.  The lobbies tho seems to alternate (could be SBMM) to some good folks then a run of nothing but sweats being toxic.  Since CW I'd have to say I've had more wholesome encounters than I did before.  Screaming 'tweens who think their Bro's cause they're cursing non-stop excepted.  BTW kid I'm tellin' your mom on you!
"I was trying to grind my crossbow longshots on shoothouse a few days ago, a random on the other team realised this after back and forth sniping with me for a bit (with me losing majority of the time) and decided to just stand still in the open and let me have the longshots until I completed the challenge.


Harry, your a real one"
Happy Cake Day !
"I feel these YouTube videos have taken the fun out of building classes in warzone. Everyone uses the same class setups for every gun. For AR it�s longest barrel, 50,60 mags, mono, commando, VLK. For SMG, all of them focus on fast moving speed. For snipers it�s minimum ADS. 


Like it�s really taken the fun of creating a class new and unique"
"I can already hear BennyCentral�s voice saying � the commando foregrip, the monolithic suppressor and 60 round mags bla bla bla �. 

Not to mention or to hate, but whenever they found a new gun that certain people liked because of its good qualities, they make it into a meta and then the secretly good weapon that people had been using just fine would then be nerfed to oblivion."
I strongly agree with this statement.
"Apart from the 60 Ext Mag. I always build the heaviest version of my guns and play HC. I don�t get why people don�t play and hate people who play slow, it�s not camping as I�m always on the move, just cover-to-cover, peak and shoot. I don�t get why people trade important factors like bullet velocity, laser-beaming recoils for a sawed-off M4?"
"Imma be honest with myself, it's a lazy meme"
"For some reason my audio wasnt recorded when I clipped this, so only my friends can be heard. Thats why it seems like someone is having half of a conversation"
Battle pass is only for CW and Warzone. Scummy thing they did putting it in Multiplayer

are we gonna get a mw exclusive bp ?"
furthermore the weapon categories I unlocked blueprints for are giving new indicators but not showing either
I haven't seen this yet so take my upvote
"What happened was that I killed myself with a molly, but I think it also has something to do with me using alt-esc"

This looks fucking epic and seems intentional
Probably how they did the flaming throwing knife bundle
Fire is no match for the mighty AK-47
"Funny how the fire is right at the gas port, which if you see those ak torture tests the furniture around there gets burned and catches on fire like this lol."
"I had this happen a few times in MP, cool glitch."
Yeah but it is slightly bigger here
Though that would be unplayable it looks badass
This happened in mp for a while too
This should have been a tracer pack.
"Or make a bundle to have the FiNN with the KA ChainSAW conversion, as ads doesn't matter with that gun so it would be cool to see that thing's barrel light up"
When ghost rider plays cod
Looks like the spirit of vengeance chose Alex. Could this be the reason why he survived the gas factory explosion?
Hahaha
Even in glitches MW looks great
Unusual AK-47.
Lmao heavy warzone update when
"honestly after i tried cw on free to play weekend, it's fun. but after several match it started to get real sweaty. also the gun animation, sound, is not that good compared to MW. and the gunsmith feels bland compared to MW"
"Infinite ward created an entirely new engine for MW and Triarch just reused an old one. That's why MW looks better, but can be buggy as hell. that's what I enjoyed about MW, also the guns are so different from each other you actually have to change your play style (Save for a few guns)"
"I prefer modern warfare for the gameplay. And I love how customizable the weapons are in it, something I feel cold war lacks. Both are good, but mw is better"
Gun costumization is better in CW but everything else is yea better in MW
"I got DM Ultra and Dark Aether a while ago and haven�t played much since. I play the occasional game once a week, see if I feel any different about it.

To me, there�s nothing to be gained by playing. I feel like I already know every gun, there�s nothing fun to use, save for the FAMAS once in a while. No interesting attachment combos. No interesting score streaks. The games just not fun. Hopefully season 2 brings something new to the table, and hopefully there�s some gun balancing. Probably not though."
I like both but MW is better simply because I play split screen with my wife occasionally an cold war has them stupid black bars on the screen an MW doesnt
CW is fun it just doesnt look very good. Very cartoony.
"Man, I wish Cold War looked cartoony. Maybe then it would have something going for it. BO3 looked cartoony. Even BO4 did to an extent. Treyarch games have always been about, clean, simple and functional graphics. 

The only thing that looks like that is the map �The Pines�. If everything in the game looked as clean as that map, Cold War wouldn�t be so bad."
"If you showed me Cw 3 months earlier I�d say this game but now since mw has ran its course with me this game is just not enjoyable anymore everyone runs around with m4s ASVALS and sweat hard as fuck it just isn�t fun 


Cold War is a change of pace for me and it�s like a welcoming environment for something new"
"I have to disagree. MW is not half as sweaty as CW. Constant UAV spam because anyone can get kill streaks, ghost hardly counters it. Ghost only works if you�re at full sprint so the moment you stop sprinting you�re on the radar. This causes constant pre-aiming that allows slow gameplay. This is just from my experience. I play MW and see a variety of guns being used but this is just from my experience. MW for me is far more fast paced and allows me to maneuver around the map a lot easier"
"I think overall, I prefer Modern Warfare, but it's a very close match up for a few reasons, since there's loads of things I like/dislike about both games.

First off, I think cold war is way faster paced. The removal of mounting and faster base movement speed makes the whole experience a lot faster than modern warfare. The ADS speed also compliments this, as it's a considerable amount faster than MW. I like that.

However, I really like modern warfare's design and aesthetic. I think the graphics are better, and I prefer the modern settings over the 80s spy theme. Also, MW's weapons sound and look way better. They're way more detailed, and their sound design makes them feel powerful. Everything in CW sounds like it's silenced.

The maps in both games aren't great, but overall I prefer CW's maps as they're smaller with no doors. Though, some of the later MW maps that were added are quite decent.

Footsteps in both games are way too loud. Camo's in both games are decent but personal preference - I think diamond camo in CW is far better than any camo in both the games. Again, that's personal preference, some people might hate it, but I personally think it looks better than DM or Damascus. DM is better than Damascus though.

I hopped back into MW yesterday, and I'm back trying to grind for damascus, cause I'm a casual scrub who didn't play for that long"
Cw has the mechanics but not the game play for me I only play zombies and campaign on cw
"tbh the only thing cw has over mw is the maps and maybe the guns. sniping in mw is was the most fun thing in so long even tho they were kinda slow, but now in cw they are slow and shoot peas. sniping w the spr in mw is literally better than sex i swear they put aimbot on that thing. mw engine just feels so perfect and smooth and everything just looks better. gun play was so fun and fast and u could stack up kills like crazy. the sbmm feels a little better in mw too.

worst thing mw did tho is not having dead silence as a perk."
I'm actually glad for that. In MW deadsilence is OP and i'm glad its a field upgrade. (i play SND so you being silent and them not knowing where you are gives you wins)
"Hmm.

As far as **gameplay**/**gunplay**, Modern Warfare and Cold War are nearly identical, aside from a few differences in the pace of matches, visual recoil, and gun attachments. 

And while I see the complaints about camping, I honestly don't feel one game is more or less camp-y than the other.

Modern Warfare, I think, is definitely the prettier of the two, for sure. MW has cooler Operator and weapon design too.

All in all, I play MW when I want to run-and-gun, and I play CW when I want to run-and-gun in silence."
I like both.
"�Try not to bias�

*Posts on a sub well known for it�s bias against CW*"
"Cold War for me is certainly better because of some gameplay mechanics, but not more enjoyable. Have much more fun playing mw. Just a way more relaxed game. In Cold War I have no fun because of how strict you know what is."
For me it�s the engine in MW and the fact they offered treyarch to use it and they just said no. Movement is fast but feels clunky and the fact I can get two shot by some guns that have close to no recoil is just ridiculous on top of it
Cold War would have been an amazing game pre-2010 because it feels like it was made back then.
Forced myself to play Cold War for a months. Ended up quitting cod for a while. Now I�m back playing modern warfare and oh boi
CW feels so awful to play. When I reinstalled MW it was a breath of fresh air. Now I just play plunder to level up CW weapons
"I love the cold war class set up. The fact that some mags are faster than other rather than have a perk is good for example. The fact that some attachments don't have cons is good. The cards is a nice twist and makes it feel more RPG choose your class style.

That said that's all it has. Don't get me wrong MW dosen't have zombies but if you compare PvP multiplayers CW does not even compare to MW. The map design is garbage and looks like it's been drawn for the aestetic factor. All those maps look like they were designed for campers and have no strategical interest. In MW each map has oportunities for close range and long range engagement. You can flank or go around, choose the best aproach for your playstyle. Make tactics. Cold war is just a bunch of corners lined up together. But it has nuketown!...again. i know it's a fan favourite but damn they could create actual good NEW maps. Create NEW classics.

And don't get me started on performance and visuals. Cold war looks like someone tried to copy CoD but didn't quite put in the effort.

Modern warfare is MUCH better than cold war imo."
"I mean, MW maps promote just as much camping if not more so than CW. Rushing aimlessly often means you'll die more. But you can shit on campers if you just learn good movement habits i.e slide cancelling and jump shotting. People will always camp in CoD regardless of map design, because it's the safest thing to do, and always will be. The only way people would stop camping, is if there was something like advanced movement, which was universally hated by this community. 

If you want a game with no campers, go play something like titanfall 2, which is in my opinion, a way better FPS than both CW and MW. It's an FPS where campers are punished so severely by those who are even just somewhat competent with the movement."
That�s a little weird... I would recommend just turning vibration off if it persists like this.
"The last time my controller vibrated was pre-covid..
It aint' broke, I just prefer it that way."
what am I missing here?   what is a bot lobby?
A lobby where people act like the  computer bots and don�t shoot back and stuff
..how do you upload to r/modernwarfare without your post being taken down? I try to share my content and i immediately notice its taken down.. Im new to reddit so idk how any of this works
self promotion is taken down on the page cause I guess they don't really like that. so if you put anything that has to do with where people can find you on other platforms it's considered self promotion. however if you just post a video then they can't really confirm or deny that the video is yours so there is a small loophole I guess. They basically just don't people @ing their faith and YT all the time.
"I played with my buddy who hardly ever plays yesterday and I just felt bad for the other team. Even players on our team were just saying how bad they felt for taking the win since it was so one sided, but my buddy was having a good time since he was around their level haha, I'm not actually convinced the other team was real people"
yeah it do be like that sometimes...but sometimes you get lobbies where you know for sure there is another person with his head stuck to the screen wiping sweat off his hands
That�s a long P90
its my PP shooter
"I am really not sure what your plan was with the 2nd guy, nor do i have any clue what he was trying to do there, wtf"
he was trying to get me to push him. he's in a good spot cause there is only one way for me to go and if I try to run back he will just shoot me...so I had to get him in a position to where he thought he could push me...so I had to take him out a little for him to push.
"In my opinion, yes. I think it�s a way better game than Cold War. It feels better, looks better and the guns seem smoother. Highly recommend"
"I�ve definitely noticed it looks better, thank you!"
Instant matches every game mode
The only mode I have issues with is realism moshpit. Games usually start right away but it ends up being 3v3 the entire match.
The SPR is easy asf to use tho
Agreed
"I.. I actually like the snipers the way they are. Sure there is going to be people in every game regardless of how bad or good the snipers are that abuse them, but even those hyper fast quick scopes are 1 of 2 things, you either have really good aim or got really lucky. 

These dudes who snap hard on you and just delete you.. let�s be honest they were gonna do it regardless of the gun, their aim was on point and their reaction time was lightning fast. There are a few guns that are unfair bullshit but for the most part I don�t agree with the gun killing you, a good player killed you. I agree the marksman rifles are way easier to use than previous titles (although look at snipers from modern warfare�s past, they have always been very strong and that�s just kind of part of the mw experience imo) but the way some of these people use them is just skill, not luck."
"I agree. People say quickscoping on controller is all aim assist, but it�s not much harder to do it with aim assist off. It�s just a different playstyle than ARs/SMGs.

For my AX-50, I actually enjoy slower ADS than instant speed because it makes the weapon seem stronger to me. I�d prefer to have to time my ADS to not get destroyed than just one tap someone before they can even react.

I�m fine with increased flinch for every weapon except one. The HDR is genuinely at a disadvantage compared to every other marksman or sniper(besides dragonauv), so it kind of needs reduced flinch to compete. Yeah, you can camp, but that�s not even fun. It�s slow ADS and lack of ADS attachments make it awful to move around with.

TLDR: also fine with balancing, but removing focus from weapon perks and increasing flinch could make it more balanced."
"Its skill but at the same time is abusing a game mechanic, once you are fully ads, your ttk is 0, in my opinion marksman rifles should have reduced aim assist and way more flinch even with focus on"
"I agree that MW balanced snipers quite well, but not just this game, the overall franchise leave me one question: 

- When will you guys stop abusing the Dragunov, huh, developers? The gun is treated worse than trash in almost every single title, and you guys are going to abuse it even more with the current title."
"The Dragunov is good if you treat it as a semi auto kar98, which I�d basically is. Don�t try to spam it, just shoot, scope out, reposition and shoot again. The worst part about it IMO is that it�s under the sniper category, which means its hit flinch is massive when being shot (even with the flinch resistance) perk. Unlike Kar and SPR, you won�t be winning any gunfights if they shoot you back"
Sniper rifle in MW are far from ballanced. They are one shot weapons and ADS faster than an SMG. That's not balanced for the slightest.
"You're thinking of Marksman Rifles, not Snipers.
Also I agree with you, if you would have read my full post I clearly state the current balance isn't perfect. Current Marksman Rifles are too fast and Focusing shouldn't even be part of the game."
"> and ADS faster than an SMG

smg ads. 180 ms, ax50 ads. 617ms"
"Mk2, kar, and spr are so cheesy and easy to use. I don't see how people complain about hitmarkers so much with those"
True
"The SKS, Crossbow, and EBR are all marksman rifles.  You just gutted them"
"You know what I mean, OSK Marksman Rifles used for quickscoping."
:(
Thats just how the game works lol. It goes through the shader install every time the game launches. Not sure if its a bug or how its supposed to work.
It's bugged. You have to download the complete game and install shaders. After that you can modify your install. Bear in mind that you have to do this everytime your GPU drivers update.
Never understood the hate it got. Been my most used gun since launch until I recently switched to the Volk AK.
I heard the hate began when there was a bug when equipping an underbarrel shotty and you could 2 hit kill anyone.... Or something like that....
"It really is. With the right attachments it�s literally a 1 tap, maybe 2 trigger pulls"
It is my go to on medium size males in tdm.
*Inside P.  A.   I.   N*
ARe you on Xbox?
"Yes, and actually ended up getting it to work by reinstalling and restarting!"
I'm having pretty much the same issue with my xbox one.
"It�s insanely annoying, since I only play warzone to play with friends"
"Have you tried restarting your pc? 

With �fastboot� off (make sure that is off)"
Yes I have. I�ve given up and just stuck to console. Strange how Cold War has no issues for me though
I'm having the same issue with no luck and I've tried all those troubleshooting tips you mentioned.
"Someone mentioned turning off fast boot on my pc , I just googled how to and I did it. Either that fixed it or the season 2 update fixed it :/"
"@reapingsalvation hate to bother u again brother. But did u personally encounter this error? If so , what fixed it for u?"
It�s a bug that popped up a couple weeks ago.  The missions show but don�t complete.
"Right... I was like, ""Why would Activision give away free stuff like that?"""
I know the Gaz challenges have always been there for some reason even if you didn�t purchase him
"And you can't complete those challenges, right?"
GODDAMNIT GIVE ME TANKIE BALE ALREADY
The sight of that gun loadout gives me killcam PTSD. I think we may have crossed paths...

if anybody cares"
This is a warzone class lol
Yeah that about summarizes it. If you missed the battle pack you have to buy a skin � most are crazy overpriced.
~~most~~ all
"Buyer beware. The operator missions have been broken for several weeks and no official acknowledgement has been made. If you buy a pack, in order to unlock the operator, you are only going to get the base and pack skin and will not be able to complete any other Operator unlocks via the missions."
"It's been like that forever. You don't even get the base version, you only get the skin you buy. You also can't unlock anything else for it, unless the current Battle Pass happens to have a skin for that character"
Well that�s on you. Iskra and Mara were both in 10$ passes twice .
Since there is no season 7 currently I�d have to say it�s the same bug that�s been around for the past couple weeks.  It shows the old missions for previous seasons but they don�t track.

Precision air strike for multiplayer. Cluster strike for Warzone. Find the air strike to be fairly useless in Warzone but maybe I�m just unlucky.
"Neither. I use personal radar, VTOL, and chopper gunner.

If I had to choose though, in core, I�d use cluster strike so I can create a 1 team path(enemy team can�t use lane, but mine can), and in HC, precision. This is because I prefer to not get thrown in the air for 30 seconds straight."

COLPO ALLA TESTA
I love a well placed sentry gun
Nice job. 9000IQ plays.
Thanks!
Giga virgin
The fact you have an obsidian 725 makes me want to puke
Oh I can use any gun that�s just one of my primary�s when I�m trying to play for fun.
Are you using these guns in warzone or pick them up sometimes?
I have never bothered to use the any of them in warzone because I don�t have any of them to a high enough level for them to have good attachments on them.
lol ur facing a bot. How he didn�t kill you is beyond me
PHYSICS
"I don�t know too much about networking, but something is definitely up.

I noticed yesterday that my ping was around 34 ms, and there was someone literally oneshotting me with an Amax.
The Amax fires 620 rounds every minute, which is around 10 every second.

It takes three chest shots to kill with the Amax. It fires 10 shots in a second so it should fire three shots in a third of a second, so it should be able to kill me in 0.333 seconds, or 333 ms.

If my ping is 34ms then at it�s lowest the ttk should be 333ms - 34ms, which is roughly 300ms.

I should have just below 300ms to react. The ttk was damn near instant.

I can�t understand what�s going on, but then again, I�m not exactly a networking expert."
it would be nice if the POTG actually worked half of the time
Yeah once in shipment I had a 9 multi and play of the game was a kid laying in a shipping container with a triple kill
"Best play is obviously more fun, but it�s way more controversial. Be a lot simpler just to show final kill on winning team."
Neither. Cant count how mamy times ive wiped a whole team 3 times in a row only to have a 3 foot away throwing knife kill get play of the game.... Like wtf.
Best play for most game modes although Best play is pretty broken. Final kill for game modes like SND.
"I like last kill only in snd, other wise best play."
"POTG is the best- but its usually broken. Half the time the replay cuts out 2 seconds into it, and the other half the game picks a stupidly boring kill as POTG.  


Did you just pull off a sick quint-kill with all quickscope headshots and throwing knives? Think it's Play of the Game material? **PYSCHE!** The POTG is actually a semtex that got a double kill because 2 guys were stuck in a doorway and couldn't escape."
I�d like POTG better if it wasn�t always some dude either spamming RPG or spawn camping
"Problem with best plays is they get real repetitive. RPG triple kill, throwing knife kill, quad feed etc 

Final kill cam is more fun. It's fun rushing to get the last kill or low-key humiliating when you're the last guy killed

I'm glad one life modes always use final killcam at least"
I think the crossbow isn't even required for damascus but I personally struggle with the riot shield and launchers take a while too.
Those were actually the first weapons I got platinum on simply due to the fact that they�re harder to get. Thank gods for shoot the ship! Thanks for your input!
"You don�t need the crossbow for Damascus. Worse for me were Riot shield, JOKR and RPG. All the ARs are a bit of a pain, simply because the kill requirements are so much higher. I found the the no-attachment for marksman rifles also a bit tough as my aim and reactions aren�t the best, but none noticeably worse than the others (I actually rather liked the carbine)."
"Dragunov by a mile, worst gun in the game."
I'd say the dragunov is pretty bad
Play Hardcore
I actually have a lot of fun with the draguov. Despite all the hate it gets. Thanks for your input!
"I did the dragunov, during one of the shoot the ships, it was aggravating but with no double xp tokens only took me 540 kills. So it�s not that horrible tbh. I would say the riot shield is the worst."
I had fun with the crossbow and found it easy but screw the riot shield
"As someone who got Damascus, I have to say that I absolutely hated using the M13 with a passion. It was a hit-marker machine."
"I was playing in HC and I went from the 556(which I hate) to the M13, and it was awful until I was 2 camos from gold. At that point, I started to like it, because it values map knowledge over reflexes. Prefire every corner, and unless they�re camping with a shotgun/AS Val, you will probably win."
For me when I was doing DMRs I hated the mk2 carbine. For whatever reason I�m terrible with that gun.
I�m not too great with the marksman rifles so that�s going to be a fun set hah. Thanks for your input!
ebr or dragunov are bad
"This is a helpful link for the Damascus grind https://damascus.now.sh. The crossbow is fun to me, but not required for the grind.

The worst for me was the HDR.  The scope creates a tunnel for your vision blocking the peripheral so I was taken out a lot when using it on shoot house."
"I used that too, it�s very helpful. You can also track reticle and mastery challenges."
"RPG hands down, then JOKR.

Riot shields not that bad if you play hardcore and shipment playlist is available."
The JOKR wasn�t too bad for me but the rpg that thing suuuuuucked.
"Xbow, I have mastery and obsidian done.  Also have all melee and launchers obsidian.  Xbow by far the worst.

also as mentioned if you're just going for dcus dont need to go dlc guns like xbow."
"Get pistols done first so when your doing primaries you can run them  with launchers, im doing them from hardest to easiest

so melee -> pistol first
 then sniper -> marksman -> shotgun -> lmg -> smg -> ar all while doing launchers

launchers are horrible to do"
I actually found the crossbow fun & got it gold in a few days. Launchers look to be the worst or maybe the riot shield for the three kills without dying toil.
"Aw man, I love the crossbow. I got platinum for snipers/DMRs just so I could have a platinum crossbow.  


It's not that hard to get gold on it. The reptile camos are annoying but can easily be ground out on Shoot The Ship. If you need help with the other camos, I have some tips that might help."
The dragunov was horrible. Launchers also horrible. Riot shield was easier/more fun than I thought it would be (had shoot the ship for that thank god)
"Dragunov, m1911, oden"
"Im still leveling the riot shield and the rpg, those are the only 2 im lacking, freaking riot shield 3before dying it's a joke"
JOKR hands down the worst weapon to get gold
"I honestly don't know what I would recommend. Obviosuly the launchers are ridiculous, but I did all of the secondary weapons and the riot shield first. Those took the longest, I think the ones I HATED the most were the FAL, the kilo, the m13, the sa87, the m91, the mg34, the pp-19 bizon, the origin, the R9-0, and I can't remember if I enjoyed using the Oden. I do know that for most weapons, especially the ARs that semi auto on hardcore gave me more control and that I turned out a lot more headshots that way. I saw someone say they were the hardest to do in the comments, but IMO it's the shotguns and lmgs because of how heavy, or how close you have to get. Those point blank kills are a pain in the ass. Either way, I've said too much, that's my two cents. Good luck!"
Jokr and the ak-47 for me. Dunno why though because I love using the ak now haha
"Off the top of my head...

1) Riot Shield. Damn near popped a blood vessel golding this.

2) JOKR. I did pop a blood vessel golding this.

3) RPG for aerial killstreaks.

4) Dragunov can be icky if you don't click with it.

Smgs can be annoying with some camo challenges.

If you plan on doing any DLC weapons...

5) Crossbow for the longshots.

6) VLK Rogue because it's icky.

7) Rytec until it clicks.

8) ISO for damage reasons. (At least the Fennec has a good ammo pool.)

9) Dual Kodachis because they're the slowest melee."
"The Fal is still pretty busted. 

It�s a one tap to the head out to around 20m and a two tap to the chest (upper torso) out to about 40m. 

A lot of people run the XRK Marksman barrel to extended the one shot kill potential, which is the most broken aspect of the gun. You don�t need any attachments for the gun to do well, but they do help. Aside from the previous mentioned barrel, I would recommend using the following;

* vertical recoil fore grip (Merc, Ranger, etc) 
* no stock 
* stippled / tac laser
* extended mag / GI mini"
its still a one shot to the head and 2 shot to the torso
only partially correct. 2 shot if 1 of the shots hits the chest
"nerfed since when tho?  It's only one or two shot upper chest within certain range.  But no, unless you're shooting through cover or teammate it should always max 3 shot."
How is the recoil compared with a Grau for example?
"The FAL is a high recoil, high skill weapon. It's way more powerful then the grau, but it takes a lot of practical to stay on target while mag-dumping a semi-auto Battle Rifle."
"By your description, I assume you mean regular multiplayer.

The FAL, like the AK, requires consistent aim at the chest and up to be a truly reliable weapon.

If you can train to aim for the [high] chest, you can consistently double-tap in most engagements, though it's always good practical to triple-tap."
It would still cost thousands. What do you think you get for $60?
"Theme pre-loaded with plugins to get stuff up and running, they have a test demo there to check and it looks piss easy to get up and running"

He glitched out and it looked like he had four arms when he went down the rope
You have heard of DUAL diamattis but now we have QUAD 2x more fun for you 8x less fun for everybody else! Only 999 $ and a free sticker
and your soul
These DLC characters are getting ridiculous. Since when did they add Goro from MK into the game?
"**FIGHT!!**

That new MK trailer has me amped. I'm gonna be highly disappointed if it's just another half-assed nostalgia cash grab"
Man i still love those short scenes
Same. Idk why but it hyped me much before the release. When i played the shitty CW beta and saw the animations There i just laughed. Like jumping out of a buggy that's driving 40mph and stopping in half a second XD the MW is far better when it comes to details
"They're so immersive and frankly they're damn cool. First time I slid down that rope it felt  awesome.

I know it's low hanging fruit, but Cold War's are just silly. Really over the top and the way your character runs at the camera is so stupid. It's like someone watched the MW animations and was like ""this is boring, we need more ACTION"""
They add so much atmosphere (while the game�s making sure everyone�s loaded/synced). Masterful touch.
I love the intro sequences. Especially like the Allegiance one on Petrov Oil Rig where you come up from below the rig to the helipad in a littlebird. Just wish there�s more variety in the next title.

OmG pOlAk RoDaK zNaLeZiOnY
There's just something about the Model 680
Cr-56 Amax
Oh yes definitely!!
Ak47
Agreed. The sound is nearly identical to the real thing.
"scar sounds amazing and the reload animations are really nice, especially with sleight of hand"
The rytec.
I happen to think the fennec looks really sleek
I don�t even like the FAL but it sound so nice
"Grau with archangel barrel, so gottdamn sleek"
The M4 with the 14.5� Barrel is the most perfect looking AR in the game. Just wish the grenadier/Corvus barrel looks as clean.
"as for the shooting sound i love the supressed SPR

as for reload animation and feel the amax is good
m13 is nice aswell"
"Awesomeee
Amax is done by Parker Chapman, one of the newest addition to the gunplay team under Khoa"
"It's a sleeper hit, but the SA87 out of ammo reload (no sleight of hand) has some killer sound effects.  


And aesthetically, the AS VAL in the VSS Vintorez configuration will always be special to me."
"Uzi, especially suppressed, really does it for me."
The fennec/vector is a beautiful gun with a high fire rate and nice sound
supped kar98k
Scar and Amax
For some reason the uzi idk
Ak-47. Sounds so powerful especially compared to cold wars
"AK sounds so brutal. M4 with the green commando camo, cronen optic + tac laser is just sexy. FAL has a nice reload animation. The guns in this game are why I keep coming back even though it has a lot of issues."
MP7 is my babe.
ak feel like you're shooting hand canons.
M13
I would say model 680. Beautiful sound a amazing reload
Bruen MK9 with the 60 round mags
The crossbow with explosive/thermite bolts. With a blueprint you can have an obsidian bow with gold strings. By far my favorite and coolest looking weapon in the game
Ak 47
uzi with the mono supressor
ODEN AK and FAL
FiNN LMG w/ suppressor and lower rof
The kali sticks.. it�s just.. there just sticks but it�s so entertaining to watch your character look at them like he has the ultimate weapon in his hands.
"the animation you do when you hold down left d-pad is funny, he looks at them as if he is holding a rare artifact"
"yo looking for teamates in warzone, im a 2 kd player 75 wins, on pc, 50 wins on ps4"
You�re not that good lmao
"Watch out, I'll clap you too"
Tough guy. This game isn't supposed to be competitive anyway.
"""Boss Battle""  Activision thought of everything!"
"Never has ""Boss Battle"" been more appropriate, and deserved.  Sure, you were on top of a skyskraper, but that's still quite impressive."
Nice
Find Makarov Operation Kingfish.
Bro where were you for almost 2 years?? Lolll
No. Nee. Nej. Ingen. Nein. Nei.
Lol
The Maps part nah bro.
"Why? MW has 26 6v6 maps, Cold War has 11 6v6 maps."
"The battle pass is based on Warzone, not necessarily MW although Warzone uses the same engine to run. With the first 6 seasons of WZ being MW based on the battle pass, I would imagine the next 6 seasons of WZ would be CW based, to drive sales towards that game as were now entering that space where leaks and things of the sort are looking towards the next installment later in the year.

I believe with WZ being the forefront of the franchise now, we can expect updates to that vs MW in general, aside from the multiplayer playlist updates.

There are 3 guns (The 80 round fully automatic pistol, a LMG, and the Skorpion Evo smg) & 2 operators (Soap & Sparks) that have been data mined, so there is a slight possibility that there could be a battle pass for those in future, but I doubt it. I could see them both being in a store bundle for 2400 a piece ($40) vs a $10 battle pass, and I could see the guns being like a mid season release if they decide to but the only gun available is the pistol, which is slightly bugged in a sense where as its only a purchasable item in Spec Ops. Also, there are plenty of things data mined in the files that will never see the light of day.

Activision will be where the money resides and from a commercial stand point, CW was super successful. There is a ton of content left to release for CW where as MW has pretty much seen its glory days and theyve moved on to working on the next CoD/regulating CW/WZ."
Welcome to the light
Waiting for my dear guns...
"I only have a few if I go into the armoury via Warzone, when I go into it from the actual MW game all bundles are showing."
Yeah actually go into mw and not warzone and you�ll see everything
"It�s not an issue, that�s the way it�s designed. It doesn�t show every blueprint in the game, been like that since the implementation."
Both of those are for packs that require purchase. The vault packs haven�t been released yet. The Ronin One was released sometime in the past couple weeks but not everyone was able to see it in the store similar to what happened with Roze recently.
Ohh ok thx bro I thought i can get them by completing the challenges btw thx
Try to complete the other unlock for her first. When unlocking skins late the game randomly forced me to do other challenges first.
I tried but still the same
That must've been terrifying.
How many Kruegers followed you because that looks a lot.
A lot of them. I couldn't stay still and count. I had to run.
New strat?
Panik.
"From what I've read on here, it's most likely locked behind a paywall in the form of operator vault packages (previous season battlepass unlocks) that are yet to be released."
Damn that sucks but thanks
The game wants you to do some other skin challenges first. The game doesn't show or tell you what to do though. Try scavenging old content on how to unlock certain season skins. It should work just fine then.
A mini map rotation would be great. I don't know about anyone else but I level guns up on StS/smaller maps to then take them to the rest of the game/larger maps.
You think people cheat because they bought a halloween pack? Nobody that cheats is going to buy a pack if their account is gonna get banned.
It goes back to when it was associated - rightly or wrongly - with cheaters who would pay or get the skins quickly after release when it would take about a week to achieve it.
I think I got it from a free bundle from the store
Yeah free bundle this past week
That may have been in one of the battlepasses. Could possibly have been a free pack too I know I just received a Mara card from a gift bundle.

"Well, yes, but also no. There are lobby�s where it�s your best to just quit but there are also lobby�s that are fine. 

For me it�s more of the first tho, I just can�t stand a full team beeing mounted in spawn or running into explosives for 10 minutes"
"1v1 me bro is where a lot of people go to play some weird-ass playstyles, especially shield and knives, just go to some basic modes like tdm, dom, kc, and it should get better"
There is always that dick head. Just quit the game when you get those matches.
I would imagine they were looking to grind camo challenges rather than have an actual game. 1v1 me bro is ideal for that provided both people are in to it.
Yea pretty much
"Infinity Ward made the game for bad players so most people abuse anything that�s given to them in this game. My lobbies are literally filled with people using riot shields, shotguns with dragon�s breath rounds, As-Vals, and ghost."
takes more skill to use a riot shield and a melee than half the OP guns in the game that have insane ttk.
"Yeah, this game is infested with noobs. The game was made for them after all, I'm sorry you wasted your bucks on this."
Is there any game modes you recommend?
I have this same issue every time. Reinstalling didn�t fix it. Except mine doesn�t matter if they�re logged in before or not. Split screen automatically means �dev error 5476�.
"Shit, SS has fallen to the bottom of their priorities it seems"
Same on PS4 splitscreen
"So its a multi platform issue it seems, that makes it worst"
"+1 same issue. We found that when the map loading screen locks up, we sometimes both hit �A� at the same time to get it to keep going. Works sometimes. Gotta hit it once, and right when it freezes. We got 3 rounds out of it tonight before it packed up. Haven�t played a single one since. All crashes. 

It�s a damn shame, we were really enjoying split screen multiplayer. Local vs Bots is just not the same."
"Ik! My wife and I really loved throwing all nighters on MultiP 
Hope they somehow fix this shit
Also, will try the ""A"" thing"

"Yup, bout time I delete MW. It�s gotten so trash that people can now start posting videos of themselves cheating. /s"
Isn�t it pathetic? There�s no way this isn�t cheating.
"Just saw the edit hahahaha, did you finally see the light or were you fucking with me all along?"
hahahaha I was waiting for it
This is so pathetic. How the fuck is Activision okay with this??
"You�ve never played with high sensitivity, have you?"
I don�t think they have an issue with aim trainers bruh
"You're cheating, plain and simple."
I see. What�s your reasoning behind that claim?
"Nice play dude, high alert helps a lot"
Thanks brother!
Ya no they ain't cheating its clear as day. Just watch when they flick they miss a few shots and take time to adjust the aim. If they were cheating it would have instant locked on and killed within 4 bullets to the body. Also the wallbang you don't need FMJ to shoot through that mini structure there I've beamed and sniped a few people through it cause people sit back there all the time.
Holy shit that was cool
Thanks man! First comment so far not accusing me of cheating.
Are.... are you hacking?
"Trust me I know how it looks, but no."
I did it a long time ago using the Kar setup for quick scoping however my friend used the sks. IIRC it was fairly lax with the requirements.
It's really lax. And it counts if you use a red dot or ACOG sight too. I think I got all mine done in a few games of shipment.
"quick scope kills for weapon mastery tracks for me, but that doesn't mean it'll track for the unlock."
I have tried several different ways and I can confirm it is not tracking. Activision support basically told me they can't help.
I just started trying to unlock the rytec in plunder and its not showing its tracking still. Idk if its just nit allowing me to do it in plunder or what the deal is
Sounds like your account was hacked. You need to contact Activision support ASAP and get the process started to recover it.
I don't have a ps5 however it runs at 60fps on my ps4 pro according to my monitor.
It runs at 60fps on PS5

"I think riot shield, knife, restock, scavenger idk perk 3 and stuns thermite"
"The weapons and nades are obvious but I run double time, restock, and shrapnel for perks"
"Yeah you've probably been hacked, it's a shame maybe try contacting activision support, and enable 2 factor authentication"
"Ok so, I�ve been playing the game again and it hasn�t happened yet. Idk what the issue was, but I�ll def be setting up two factor authentication and maybe even contacting activision customer service

Thanks!"
why just on kbm lmao? controller doesn't deserve an fov slider too?
They put the FOV slider in cold war for all platforms. Guess they just didn't feel like going back and adding it to MW too. They've been stingy with MW updates since cold war came out. Probably to focus on the next game coming out this year.
"i see this kind of post and comment everyday."" cold war has fov slider why don't MW?""

answer is always MW engine is brand new and it's too new for old gen consoles. 

where as cold war has BO2/BO3 engine which is super old from like 2012 or 2013"
Cold War just got it I doubt they�ll go back and add it to mw I hope it does get added to warzone tho I played last night for the first time with fov up I put it on 90 and even that was a game changer
If the rumors of them testing Verdansk on the Cold War engine is true it�s likely they may add it in the future should they make the shift.
It's about the friends you made along the way
My teammate had no mic and he was the best rando teammate I ever had
im not really a fan of the anime packs but this is an instant cop
3000 CP? Shit that might be the most expensive pack I've ever seen. At least give us an unicorn execution lmao
Haven�t seen it in my stores but I vibe with the cute unicorns ngl.
I dig it for the Mohawk lol.
I do. Faceless operator was sorta cool!
It�s a realistic cool and not over the top. I appreciate stuff like this more than some chick in a skinsuit with no body armor.
Early Modern Warfare had a realistic aesthetic and then they progressively changed it to what it is now and has been.
"This one is still my favorite. This or the Season 1 ghillie suit guy. 

Also miss when it was CoD: MW and not COD: Warzone: MW."
The ghillie suit was really cool too. The last cool one before they went all crazy with the operators.
"You mean COD: Warzone: BOCW: (small font) MW

I wished it could be better in season 2 when they don't need to promote BOCW sales so much, but looks like this will last the whole year.

Well at least we can play MP and Warzone in the same game... not like the BOCW fans"
At this point we should be able to select our loading screens.
"I am with you bro, and spawn themes too, i wish if i could post but i have got shadowbanned.... if only someone can grant my wish..."
"Nah bro, that's free advertisement board for the don't you know."
"Yeah, I hate this Fortnite character we have for the past 2 months"
I think its trying too hard.
"Black Ops has the WORST looking bad guys!!! 

�I know, what if we covered him in chains! Yeah! And a muzzle too that�s scary! Make him a cannibal prisoner so they know he�s bad! Let�s put this guys hood up and give him a gas mask! Make him half blind! Ohhh boy now he�s a real bad guy!�"
The dude with the hood and the gas mask?
Right now it�s just warzone shmarzone all in your freakin face
Much better than BLACK OPS COLD WAR WARZONE SEASON 2 BUY THIS SHIT TODAY
Still makes me laugh how BATTLE PASS is bigger than the title of the game hahah
" before they plastered a bunch of unnecessary shit on top. Can't even tell you're loading MW anymore.

By comparison, CW is a flop. And i guess they took that to mean �advertise it *HARDER* �"
Yeah It�s annoying whenever I boot up mw and I see all the Cold War propaganda I�m like hold up did I boot up the wrong game.
"why is Activision pushing our faces in it when their claiming CW is the ""Best Selling Game ever""  then?  ugggggggh!"
I miss season 1 Mara and season 6 Farrah loading screen. Also velikan when he had the finn lmg with the extended mags that was really cool. I hope we have mw loading screen back when s2 for Cold War starts but I doubt it
Yea stitch with his big scar just looks cringy
"I also miss the old menus. I like blue. Now everything is grey, and sometimes the text bugs out and shows as dark grey on a black background. They messed up the menu so much"
"Same. Everything about the Cold War promotional stuff just feels like they got a 12 year old to design it all. Well, either that or 12 year olds are their target audience. I know MW's Ghost was a bit corny (the mask and cape felt like a superhero villain) but Stitch is just as bad if not worse. And that's only season 1!"
MW�s ghost makes me sad lol. They could have done a more modern version of the MW2 ghost and it would have looked so cool
Stitch? You mean dime store Bane?
I�m glad they�re getting a little better with Season 2s guy
I think the aesthetics of blackops are generally worse. The new loading screen looks cringe as fuck.
"Idk about you but operators that look like this are way cooler than the over the top ones we got after season 1. 

Mysterious tactical operator dudes already look sick, why do people want operators that look like pacific Demi gods or lost scuba divers?"
"Yes

I fucking hate Cold War and their cringe operator Stitch, don't get me wrong, MW has many cringy operators and skins but at least they are from a good game."
"Yeah haha, like Gimp suit Roze (or Boba Fett Roze actually) and Ghost 2019 are pretty dumb, but Stitch is just ridiculous."
What! I�ve never seen before so cool they should bring it back
Season 0 and 1 had cool loading screens like this. So did the beta. But when the battle pass came it changed
"Now it says in extremely big words BATTLE PASS.
I mean, it doesn't even says BLACK OPS or WARZONE anymore, at least that was a name, now they only care for people buying that shit BP because nobody wants to play CW lol

Not to mention how they eliminated the MW name from any screen title and even the game logo, which now passed to ""Call of Duty Warzone"" with a lame tiny Price in the corner so you can distinguish if you're opening MW or CW"
"A LOT

especially in comparison to getting bombarded with Cold War stuff.....i already bought the damn game i wish they'd back off a bit"
Not me
yeetus yeetus prepare for downvotus stormitus
Dude I�ve had the same issue. I had demascus and a few obsidians too. Around the same time too. I�ve been completely ignored.
"If they are not responding on e-mail, maybe u should try to communicate with them in other way"
"Im in a similar situation, sadly you can't even contact them by email, you have to do an account recovery form which in my experience they respond with by saying that my issue was not relevant to the form and link me to irrelevant support articles.

All you have is a support site which suggests things to you based on what you pick like game/issue etc. Some of them let you go to a live support chat but I've never been able to talk to anyone on it. It never provides a way to do a support ticket through email or anything."
"Currently having the same issue, I find it crazy that a while ago they didn't have two factor authentication, and then they don't even have a proper support email/ticket system and only a single form which is confusing to follow. I don't know why they would be so opposed to just moving an account back to an old email when I can prove that im the owner of the account with purchases etc."
"My friend recently got hacked(January) and was in contact within a week by activision support. Strange your ticket is in a limbo

All my friend did was: 
             He did 4 emails and 2 Texts, all were within 1-2 minutes of each other and was able to get a response from them after one day.
He recommends just spamming them with tickets."
"I�m having this same issue, could you PM me the number and email your friend used? Thank you!!!"
Same thing just happened to me. Can you pm me the number and email you used?
"Mine was hacked two weeks ago.  I did the recovery request and got the account back a week later.... but the thief added 2FA to my account, and they didn't clear that when they ""restored"" it.  My gamertag was re-linked, and I guess they called it a day after that.  When I play on Xbox my account is there, for now, but I can't log into the account in a browser to change the password or add 2FA in any way that protects it from being stolen again.  Every time I log in I have to accept the account may be stolen again.  I can't log into the companion app, either, but it was already logged in when he stole it so I know the bnet ID of the thief.

The customer support is pathetic for a company that makes this much money.  The phone number will never be answered, it runs you around in circles telling you to go to the support website, the website sucks  and severely limits your options.  

If you go through the steps to request help they push you toward ""Account recovery request"" but it also says ""other suggestions"" under that, which I always ignored, because it is useless stuff like ""Create strong passwords.""  It turns out that sometimes, there is a button to chat with a rep in there.  Sometimes the button doesn't work- launches a chat window that never loads-  sometimes it simply isn't there, and sometimes it works and you have to wait 2 hours because you are 200th in line.  I did that and after a fairly long chat they said they couldn't help me, because I logged in with a new account so I could get to the chat window, but it being a new account, they couldn't do anything for the real account.

Finally, I learned that I have to log in with my Xbox ID, not my activision account, which is then locked by 2FA, but it has my foot in the door enough to ask for help with that account... and nothing since then.  The landing page between the login and the 2FA gave me an option to send an email, I got a ticket number emailed to me and no news yet- it has been less than a week since I did that.  It implies that I am entitled to send an email because I've had an account for so long, if you don't get that option you have to progress towards the chat options I mentioned earlier.

&#x200B;

Good luck, I'm sorry this sucks so much, it sucks for me, too."

"Bro, that was cool"
"Nothing you can do about it really, I only play ground war and I enjoy the port, farmland, quarry and the district sometimes. Well all of a sudden last week I started getting nothing but the boneyard, promenade the airport and what other map is in. It sucks I absolutely hate playing those maps but they probably put those on the top of rotation for a while unfortunately."
"Dude this the exact opposite for me lol. Literally all that comes up for me is krovnik, port and shitty aniyah palace. I might get promenade or downtown like 1 out of 15 matches or so. They definitely did something"
"This just started happening last week. Before I would get a decent selection of all maps and no matter how many times you back out, it�s like it still puts you in the same lobby"
"Same lol. it's not a problem on your end or on MW's tbh, it's just that games with tavorsk district/ karst river quarry get filled up more often, when I get those maps I stay for the entirety of the game even if I'm losing real bad. Maps like Promenade have a lot of players leave so they fill up those gaps with players looking for games.

sorry if the English is fucked. does that make sense?"
"I think I understood the majority of what you're saying but I think it may be mw because I can still find games open through recently played but it's a real pain because of the fact it sends me back to a loading screen with a background sound of of a guy whispering in my ears ""let's have some fun"" or something along those lines every time I leave a lobby( like gee thanks that's what I'm trying to do) and that I can litterally spend all day match making and only get tavorsk karst quarry to pop up once"
"That�s so weird because I constantly get stuck with Port, Downtown and riverside. Never get Promenade"
Downtown? Trust me you dont friggin want it
I think that no one wants to play Promenade and Riverside that so many people back out when these maps come up which means those are the lobbies with the free spaces the most.
so it�s kind of an unwritten rule. the thing is though you don�t have to follow it. eventually if you use a regular weapon they will switch to a regular weapon. but 1v1s from the beginning have been snipers so when people saw 1v1 in the playlist that�s what they do. i use a crossbow instead of a sniper and people get mad. you can�t please people. just do what you want bro in the end it�s up to you how to play the game. it�s supposed to be fun for you to play. so do what makes you happy and have fun :)
"Agreed, no point in pleasing people, just wish they wouldn�t be so toxic about losing. Some people just get so bent out of shape about it."
Thats just classic CoD trash talk. CoD trash talk makes no sense most of time.
"Thanks, that�s what I figured, but wanted to make sure I wasn�t �doing it wrong�."
"Nah, it's wannabe faze kiddies, just ignore"
"Yeah, if you're good it will still benefit you too have a sniper so they're pretty much admitting they're trash."
Had the same thing while using a carbine. The guy said it was disgraceful.
In my opinion marksman rifles are the most fun and challenging guns in the game. Get so bored of people spraying everywhere with assault rifles or jumping around quick scoping with the Kar
I normally use what they�re using but I can�t tell you how many times I run into people using the spr #yawn
1v1 has always been an aim game. Sniper are generally the best way to determine who has better aim. 1 shot 1 chance and if you can't hit that you suck
I try to just use snipers on 1v1 but if the other players are using smgs I usually just switch gun
"It�ll be a welcome addition but I think it�s going to be difficult to implement from a technical standpoint. And I think its why they havent, due to the way operator models and selection are done in this game."
"COD Ghosts could do it, its not the first time in COD history to introduce something like it. I think the only reason this didnt happen was purely cause they didnt expect this kind of recognition from players for this and the game as a whole"
At the very least it would be nice if the default Milsims were selectable instead of being tied to specific weapon classes.
"If your favorite loadout on warzone is of a certain weapon class once you spawn into a game your model will be the one of corresponding weapon class, so there�s that"

Then again, if this only occurs in MW2019 and you do play different games then I wouldnt be too worried about your hardware."
"It's the game. I have a 1070 strix that can easily handle most stuff but this game the last couple of weeks has been crashing if i push the gfx settings too high even though they are way under the 8GB limit.  


Never had a problem before. Think it was the friday before last that it did a small update and ever since then there have been problems."
Nice to see a clip here every once and a while thats not the meta spam. Awesome shots.
"Ya done good hassle hoff, ya done good."
There a bunch of issues with the default skin. Like the head staying the same but the body changes when you use a different weapon. Or the sleeves on the Russian default guy are different to his pants and character model. Or the coalition default has a darker skin tone in 1st person (and wears gloves even if the character doesn�t) although he�s white in 3rd person. Not to mention how they gave up adding the different uniforms depending on each map. Like if you�re on a sand map the default guy would be in desert clothing; they completely gave up on this after launch.

"That's odd. I swear, and I mean, I swear on my life I have seen a couple players having a overlapped skin with Assault and Sniper Mil-Sim during the match. It affects both Warzone and Multiplayer.

I wish I could send you the screenshots on my PS4."
it's visual bug ONLY in plane scene. so it's minor yet it's present since the start of WZ afaik
It says that but it worked with me. Just put mo� money on the renneti and it should work.
Alrighty. I was worried about how the hell I was gonna get that unless survival counts towards that
I smell an Easter egg
"Yeah its a typo, it should say Renneti. Looks like someone(devs) got ahead of themselves."
"Just FYI that akimbo renneti was nerfed to ground. It's a weaker version of akimbo M19 if you don't use burst, and akimbo burst damage per bullet is almost halved. 19 per bullet and no headshot if I remember correctly. Still fun to use in an easy lobby though.

In case you want to do anything about warzone: dual Diamatti is the only pistol you may want to use in warzone (even post-nerf). Or any fully-loaded MW pistol to fill up your SMG ammo."
"I've got a word for it.

But you wouldn't like that word."
to fix reloading switch it to a different key(you mentioned csgo so im assuming mouse and keyboard) and also grab big mags in your guns so that you domt need to reload alot. also learning maps will take awhile but since its not a huge selection it wont take forever
"Specific to you: 

I notice you're not using tac/lethal very often. If you have those in your kit, use them. Hitmarkers from flash/stun can tell you enemy locations, and enemies aren't going to be able to fight back at 100% if they're somewhat affected by a tac when you peek them. Your semtex has a short fuse and is great for area denial if someone's pushing you because the beeping is loud. I basically chuck my tac the second I approach a lane that I might encounter an enemy. I will follow it up with a lethal if I actually get a hitmarker on the tac. 

Sometimes it's worth trying to communicate with teammates even if they don't reply, just keep the callouts short and clear. 

Some random advice: 

I hated this game for the first month that I didn't know maps well. They seem complex at first but they really aren't that bad. It's all map knowledge and angles. There actually aren't as many angles as people like to bitch about when you actually peek them in order. 

Try the different modes until you find what you have the most fun doing. I ended up settling on HC FFA because talking shit or making buddies can be hilarious, and I love the lone wolf aspect of hunting enemies down. It's also great for grinding weapon unlocks and camos because you can easily break over 20 kills in a very short match. Also, HC negates weapon meta. 

Depending on the mode, you're basically trying to reduce the time you spend checking corners by ruling out where enemies could be based on spawn timing and map control.

Try and learn common wallbangs while using snapshot and fmj, it's worth it. 

Use launcher secondary if you're grinding camos and get those done alongside weapons so you don't have to do them all at once."
Thanks! This is really helpful.
I don't think it's called 7.62 but I could be mistaken. There's a 50 cal or bullet charm. Can't remember where I got it from though. Maybe from one of the packs I purchased on rotation.
50 cal one I either got it from a daily challenge or a mission
It�s a 50 cal bullet and it�s from one of the launch mission sets
Ooo bud. I'm pretty sure you can only link and re-link once per year
This happened probably 1-2 years ago
So you linked your account to your friends account smart
Yupp
I�m dealing with a similar issue any progress?
Nothing so far
"So some more context because there's a character limit, and I have all the needed packs to play co-op but I�m unable to play. I tried restarting twice but nothings working."
I had this issue I deleted the game installed the packs than reinstalled the game. It sucks but it worked.
Compatability pack?
"Also, I�m not trying to come off a certain way. 15-7 isn�t crazy and I�m not the best player. But my friend and I dropped 25, our other 4 teammates dropped a combined 7 kills and 29 deaths. Something ain�t right with that"
I�m confused. I got a bunch for playing campaign and other modes in MW and BO.
"Yeah they hand them out like candy tied to random challenges, but I'm talking about every specific card had a specific challenge or requirement attached to it"
The calling cards from mw3 were elite
"for real, and the emblems also"
"I just wish they said how you got them in a little description like they used to. Say if you completed challenges for them or if they�re from a pack. I agree, I used to grind the hardest challenges for calling cards and emblems so I could flex them and now it�s just kind of what looks cool and much less meaningful."
Yeah I definitely feel the same for the ones that took something to unlock. I have one that I remember specifically the challenge was get a merciless but aside from that they all just blend together
Yah I was looking at them and was curious what I did to get it. Just like you saying old games it was locked and told you what was needed for them. Yah some I got randomly but I would like to know how I got them
 they have the challenge description written under them. Some are from battle pass so they don't have the description.
"I did not play during that era, but I can imagine the difference. I have more calling cards now than I know what to do with, and most of them are lame throwaways. The cards of which I�m most proud are those that I acquired through . . . hard work, for lack of a better term. 

Gold/obsidian/etc. weapon cards and so forth. I understand your sentiment."
"Some of them require tasks to be met, like the mastery cards, while others are just cool.  I get what you�re saying, but I also remember the days of people boosting just to get the nuke card, and that�s why it was removed."
There is a nuke calling card though (30 gun/weapon kills) you can unlock.
I want the Danger Prone calling card from MW2 that had the bandages and crutches all over it lmao.
"I miss how MW2 was. Get an AC-130, boom you get the animated AC-130 Emblem. Shit like that, and all the emblems had cool hidden challenges you had to do to unlock. You couldn�t purchase anything, you had to unlock it all by doing challenges."
"MW3 calling cards were fun, with how it told you what every challenge was

But at the end of the day I still think MW has nice calling cards even if it just throws them at you for no reason. The animated ink spill grim reaper one is pretty awesome"
Calling cards are lit there over like 1300 to collect if you want the �hard ones to get� do the mastery challenge calling cards.. lol
Do the mastery challenges
"Calling cards? You're complaining about calling cards? Maybe this the reason games are in the state they are nowadays. Devs have to implement stupid stuff like calling cards and icons und absurd weapon colors just for the new generation to stay at the game. I'd like to have my own dedicated server, player kicking, map vote, own house rules, etc - you know things that change the game...but hey calling cards are important....\*rolleyes\*"
"Jeez man chill out, I literally said I know it's something small but news flash everyone else already has said over and over about map voting / overall critiques and balancing etc like a million times. This is something I hadn't seen a post about so I wanted to say something. It's the open internet."
"Why apologize for a crossbow win, that�s great."
except you were using the mac10 so you might as well have been handed your win on a silver platter
This is actually kinda good considering how broken marksman rifles are. Well done
"I�m not very good with them, this is the first cod I�ve really ever tried sniping in despite playing the game my whole life."
What gun is that and what skin ? It looks good
[Striker 45 Dream Dasher](https://www.gamesatlas.com/cod-modern-warfare/cod-warzone-weapons-epic-blueprint/dream-dasher) I usually speed plant on search for my team so I usually use the burst to make me as light as possible. However the gun is pretty amazing full auto and is a much better weapon with different attachments.
"It�s a new thing in Cold War as there are more cosmetics added.  Similar to legendary they have full attachments (5 attachments) and added details like ICBM missiles on one of the guns.  They�re not limited as of yet, but that may change down the road."
Appreciate the response thanks!
"Not new, been there since BO4"
It's pretty much mastercraft weapons not new
Reactive Camos conning season 2
They basically just have different weapon inspect animations and more detailed skins. No they are not limited time only. For example on the AK-74u variant above when you inspect the gun in BOCW they plays with it like a toy and pull the red knob on the back of the gun. Other than that it functions like the normal gun.
Appreciate the response thanks!
Can someone explain this please? Do you only have a limited time to get these items or is it just that Ultra is a new weapon rank?
There's been 2 others I belive
Sounds pretty awesome to me!
Thanks! I appreciate the feedback!
You�ll get a better response if you do this as a poll question
"I did, thank you!"
"doesn't sound interesting imo, spawns on tdm aren't suitable for competitive play"
Can you elaborate? Like Shipment is ALWAYS nuts. But what about the other maps?
I would definitely participate in this
Really?! Good to know! Thank you!
Are you a knife only player too? I thought I was the only one lol.
"On this map, when people are being toxic, I like to bring out the knives. Just makes victory much sweeter"
Probably got hacked
I thought items weren�t transferable? This isn�t counter strike where shit can be traded
Sounds like you got hacked. All too common sadly. Contact Activision support.
I got back on yesterday since december too. Mine looks normal
You signed into the right activision account?
"Yes, I just triple checked. It seems the the one single thing that I still have is my toronto ultra skin, but only for 2 operators. I had every single one unlocked before. I just went to my records page in barracks and it shows 0 kills and 0 time spent playing."
"You are probably shadowbanned too, did you try queuing for a game?

there's been a bunch of these reports and the mostly likely reason is activision thought you got hacked and for some reason their lockdown process results in this sometimes. You're gonna have to contact support, and reply to / DM their twitter support too."
What is shadowbanned?
"You bought cosmetics in a cod game, you low-key deserved to loose them (not being mean) but it�s a litteral waste buying cosmetics in a cod game when it�s usually dead after a year, I do hope you get it back though, have you tried contacting support?"
Mad cause poor
"It�s not the cosmetics I care about really, but the guns that I spent weeks getting to gold. All my ARs, SMGs and snipers were max level or very close, and a good portion of them were gold. That pisses me off way more than losing a few shiny skins."
That may be true a few years back but current days that term is far from true mw Cold War and warzone are all linked togther the cod this year will be added to warzone and have a four game progression system warzone will be around for a very long time so if you play them game a lot you will enjoy and get your money�s worth out of cosmetics I have bought a couple bundles don�t regret it at all
"Every COD with working servers still has people playing years later, no COD is ever dead.

Modern Warfare 2019 will be packed for a very long time."
"Your player profile is stored on the activision / battlenet server, so unless you linked your psn to a new cod account, your progress should carry over as long as you use the same psn id and call of duty account."

I'm mean ass is fine but I doubt people don't want the N word blaring from their devices
Is that the new m13 in the roze pack? I use her regularly but idk how I feel about her without the helmet..
Yessir. I like the character since Jamie Gray Hyder voices her and she was in IW. The gun itself is dope
why did this get taken down?
"there was one final killcam where no one was killed, there wasnt even an enemy on the screen, so we just had a slow-mo reload to watch"
interesting
"Probably because the guy who did the reload had tagged the enemy, and the enemy had killed himself off screen"
Well that team got destroyed lol
ya it was a sad match at least for them
"Had that happen to me last night. I got last kill, �Final kill� was a guy shooting at me as I killed someone else."

I think your back hurts for different reasons

Truth"
"Couldn't agree more. Once I started using it, I knew I had to get gold on it. The journey doesn't feel as grindy as other weapons because you're actually having fun"
Yes I agree
My favorite and most enjoyable weapon is the kali sticks.. just so satisfying when you get that thwack thwack.
It�s the only gun I run in multi and warzone now. Used to be scared to run it as a primary but now I can�t play with anything else lol
Truth. Got it gold today
This is what you call a quality montage.this was sick!!!

"Been having similar symptoms. Feb 21st, I managed to get through several split screen matches to the point where I thought the crashing shenanigans were over (little did I know, that was not the case!)

Ended up trying to play today and I kid you not, I couldn�t for the life of me even START a game without the game crashing (on PS5 also) and in the end, we did manage a whole match of Shoothouse but no surprise, cod mw crashed again...I�ve decided to just leave the game alone until tomorrow and see if anything�s better/different."
It�s been like that for last few months unfortunately
Same here
"Same, only noticed this happening in the past month or so"
That sounds right. It seems like it coincided with the start of the XP bug.
"Same on ps4 slim. I thought disabling HDR would do the trick, and for1 evening it seemed to work. The next day it kept crashing every couple of matches while loading.

This is the splitscreen life now, at least until season 2 starts in a couple of days. They aren't going to fix it now they have a big update lined up just days from now"
"Man I hope so. Split screen seems somewhat forgotten... so I�d hope to see it fixed! 

Side note, any other split screeners notice that Infection works when it�s in the main playlist but doesn�t work when it�s selected in the core filter? Little things like that remind me that the days of Goldeneye are a thing of the past (people playing in the same physical room)"
"Also, I didn�t list the numerous things we did to see if was any more stable. 

-not modifying weapons in between a matches
-not changing operators in between matches
-not playing most of the core games, specifically cyber attack since it seemed to happen a lot on cyber attack
-restarting the PS4 before we played (our kids play a lot of fall guys, maybe that was messing with the memory or something???)"
"Got exact same issue, after being extremely disappointed with Cold War issues, me and my gf decided to buy MW, and can�t even enjoy games online together. Not sure why Activision keep fucking up their own games. Hopefully Battlefield 6 shits on CoD."
same
"idk why it would not let me type what I said but, I need help with what ever this is. I just want to send my stats from my Xbox to my PC but it wont let me."
I dont think its your system. Ive seen so many posts about this same thing after each update and it keeps getting worse. Even people with crazy specs are noticing significant frame drops. They may just need to put out another update to fix it. Hopefully soon.
"leave priority at normal.  lower graphics settings, maybe even render resolution.  if your motherboard supports auto overclock, or if you know how to do it manually, give that a shot.  boosted my 7700k from base to 4.8ghz and my frames started to dip less.  and i'm running a 2080 with it.    make sure you don't have any programs that randomly use up the cpu, or have as few programs running as you can.  

otherwise, it's just straight up the game itself.  it's only gotten worse with each update,."
[removed]
I�ve ended all background processes. My CPU is clocked at 4.6Ghz & my graphics are at low all across the board. Still having insane frame drops :/

Thank you been scratching my head trying to figure out what this thing was
"It's crazy technology. Extremely powerful caliber, belt-fed, able to take a suppressor, and only 20 pounds. Some of the new gear the U.S military is looking at is insane."
you can also chamber it in 7.62 nato
Holy mother of recoil
The variant OP picked up has no stock
Try Rust and then talk to me about recoil. This game has no recoil compared to rust.
"As I came back to the game I ""unlocked"" mw's version of the scorpion evo, but it doesn't exist in the inventory, guess I just have to live with the notification forever. Gotta love content that's there, but not in game."
[removed]
If your on console go to weapons where you are all the options like load out kill streaks ect and press down on the left stick to get rid of all notifications In that tab works on all tabs in mw
You can use the guns that aren�t in MP yet in Co-op survival mode.
"Set yourself up with a deployable cover. You can crouch and mount and get 2 camos done simultaneously.

Play HC and you�ll get easier longshots plus 5 or 0 attachments."
I thought you couldn�t get both at once? Since they�re different �stances�
crouch + mount + no attachments + longshot + headshot + shortly after reloading for maximum efficiency
"I feel like that's more douchy than using the wall on Shoot House haha. Plus, I'm killing two birds with one stone: longshots and mounted kills"
"Jesus why did I never think of this, THANK YOU!!!"
"On Shoothouse there are multiple locations where you can crouch and mount...shame is that people get wise and avoid the areas...got to admit never thought of using the deployable cover, very smary."
i use the deployable cover in this map in the tunnel. works wonders. Smoke and thermal optic
I've read multiple times on this sub that you can't get those simultaneously
Mounted camos = Hardcore + Deployable cover
I have never used the Deployable Cover since I bought the game. I forget it exists lol
"Dep. cover, hardcore,  shipment. Gets it done in no time."
"Dude there are 10 better places in shoothouse, the wall is the worst one"
"Exactly, if you stay in the same place the whole match soon or later enemies will notice it,  thats the dumbest thing while grinding camos, i never had issues doing them, if you mount in a place, kill one or two enemies and then move and mount in a differentent place you can easily get 10 or 15 mk per match"
I remember the excruciating grind for damascus. Hang in there!
"I'm not even going to attempt to go for Damascus. Sniping is just not my strong suit and i feel like I'd go insane with those, as well as the knives and riot shield. I'll just get silver for the ARs, SMGs, shotguns, and pistols. Idk about LMGs cuz i only have the FINN, the L86, and the PKM maxed. I don't even have the Bruen unlocked lol"
Thermal + smoke mid. Scummy but it works
I sometimes do that when there's more than one dude but i try my hardest not to do it.
"Ahhhh, the mount+longshot grind"
It's truly hell
Hardcore always
This was hardcore lol
Go to Hardcore St. Petrograd and mount up on the wall over the pool haul. Switch to a thermal sight a little into the match when people catch on to you being there so you don't die. Best way to go about it for almost every AR
"Nah, u want the car just behind pool hall, theres a mounting spot by the C pillar (just behind the back door) and you can see all the way to the door to the back alley bit, with the flats, if youre playing domination 6v6 and have 4 of your teammates push down the riverside road, two of you by the car/pool hall roof, it will force their spawns to the back alley and they will have to run across you to get out, I know its a scummy thing to do, but Ive found that as long as you use a hybrid or acog (meaning not a 1x of sniper scope) you can get a clear view of them, and they almost cant see you. I would recommend hardcore because one-two shot kills and no killcams"
Mount the barrels in hardcore Shipment. Easiest mounted kill possible.
This was me last night as well haha. Only have to finish the kilo to get platinum for the AR. Fuck Damascus though. Not going to get gold on all the launchers.
It is way better to mount on the lane to the right from where this was taken. You can mount on the woodboard car and hold shanty town; or the other way around and mount the border of shanty town (or the barrels stacked there too).
[removed]
If you get shipment just do it bc you can do the mounted kills quick af then when you get shoot house grind longshots.      Or what I do is if I get shipment I'll do my shotguns and if it's shoot house I'll do my AR's
[removed]
"OOOOHHHH DAMN i was wondering why in that map people are always camping there even though that spot literally screams, ""shoot me im right here"""
Da Ja Vue.
Longshots are the worst for me!
"hardcore + deployable cover, got literally 50+ mounted longshots on a single game"
It�s easier in domination. Mount near a B flag.
I didn't know you can bamboozle in cod
"A relatable sight. Some games you do great and get through like 3 camos there, others you keep stepping up and getting shot in 2 seconds flat.
And don�t even get me started on those pricks who throw smoke down the alley the whole game to stop other people getting any longshots without using a thermal scope.
I�m glad my Damascus grind is over lol"
Pro tip. Equip deployable cover and camp on top of the barricades overlooking the junkyard lane to your right.
"Mounted kills is usually one of the last I get too and when mounting that wall on Shoothouse you either get a really good match, or a fucking awful one lol - there's no in between."
Shield camos though...
"I prefer playing smaller ground war maps for longshots, like farmland or promenade"
Lmao smoke and thermal bro
Smoke grenades + thermal scope = profit
[removed]
Many people don't know that but u can't actually move and mek the camo and it is actually as fast as sitting in spawns
Same
The problem is you guys doesn't even try o win while doing camo quests. That's supposed to Be fun. No a boring grind like that. I did mines and it didn't change my death kill ratio because i played normally and it was really cool.
"I feel your pain. I'm 80% there. But nothing has been harder than the JOKR so far. Riot shield and knife were a bit tedious, but this and the JOKR, ughhh"
How did you do the shield? I've been challenged to do it by a mate of mine and I'm dreading it
It's a lot easier on shipment because of the horrible spawns so you can mount by the forklift and get it done quick
"Oh and also do hard core shoot house, it's way easier for camo grinding"
Looks like he's already in hardcore. He only has the compass at the top. No other HUD
I dont mind it as a feature but as a Challenge ? Yes I do mind them
Small price to pay for mastery camos
"Bro, get a thermal scope and pop a smoke there. It will make it so much easier."
Been doing sniper golds and i feel this pain especially when no one peaks mid
For mounted camos I set myself up on the container ro the right of this with deployable cover so I was overlooking the junkyard and shanty Town.
"Just got Damascus myself, I found Ground War very helpful for mounted longshots. I was getting 15-25 a game but maybe I was lucky."
Mounted really suck but they aren't as bad as behind cover in CW
12 longshots away from gold on M19 and then grinding to obsidian. The good thing about pistols is that you need no mounted kills. Imo longshots are the hardest as I needed about 40 longshots till MP7 but then gave up on it after unlocking every other camo.
"you know mounted kills are probably easier in ground war. more places, more people and more maps to work from."
"Hey not everybody gets more than 1 life, count your blessings"
play regular maps and mount on the deployable shield.
"Yep, I know how you feel. Try doing mounted kills with the crossbow and tell me how much you hate grinding for it then."
"Camos to me are just not worth jumping through all the arbitrary hoops I would need to jump through. I'll unlock the ones I get from playing naturally, and maybe I'll go for something that is close to being done. But so many are like ""get 100 mounted kills"" and I just say, no thanks, that is not how I want to spend my time. If I really want to use a Damascus camo I'll just pick one up off the ground during a match."
"LOL,  liked the other suggestions.  Often the first grinder to the wall has you sighted, any head the pops gets a bullet.  I know I've been that guy. Maybe another option is use a thermal scope, throw smoke in front of wall mount and sight?  

Hope the other guy doesn't have a thermal scope."
Why would you ever mount in the middle of the most heavily sniped area in all of Cod?  I did mine rather quickly. Every time I hit a corner I would mount.
"The shoothouse wall giveth, and the shoothouse wall taketh away.

That's the longshot/mounted spot, you can mount anywhere else when longshots aren't the issue without being such a target.  Also, get some smoke and a thermal when this starts happening."
"I turned off the mount feature long ago. The only reason I don't have the gold, platinum, obsidian, Damascus camos is due to the mount challenges. I just can't be bothered."
Yeah longshots and mounted kills are the most boring thing. But that's what make that gold and more camo special.
I recommend smoke and thermals on hard-core.
HAHA love it
Use smoke and themal.
The uzi slaps man. I love it compared to the Mac 10 meta right now because of its range capabilities and ammo capacity. Get it maxed and you'll never put it away.
"Having so much fun running it today. I swapped off for a bit to level the AUG, but it is most def my favorite weapon rn"
"Drop some attachment setups guys, how do you have it?"
"Merc foregrip, holo sight, 13.1 inch barrel, ultralight stock, and muzzle break.

The recoil is non-existent; your ADS takes a small hit with the grip and barrel but it�s so worth it for the added stability. With already pretty good snappiness and hip fire, I find it very useful for running round corners and still has enough accuracy to pin headshots on cheeky snipers at mid range"
Any idea what the best way is to get the longshots for a uzi? Like for instance in shoot the ship?
"In my limited experience, holo and reflex sights work best, they don�t bounce as much; and spec out for good control. Then it�s just a matter of burst fire, or hold trigger/mouse 1 until the target is dead. It doesn�t move much shot for shot, so you should be able to hold on target pretty easily, provided you have the patience to tap fire - but even then, know your limits on distance; this is *not* the weapon for anything beyond maybe 50-60 m"

there are many hidden spots  in Grazna Raid
"There's multiple ways up there btw. You can jump from the tank or you can jump on the shelf inside 

Grazna raid has a few more second floor spots to get up to, like halfway down that same field there's the brick building you can get up 

Oh just remembered Arklov Peak has one. If you spawn on the big barn side it's on the left lane. It's an open corner of a building overlooking the destroyed house 

Hackney Yard you can access another level at the base of the chimney. Put a deployable cover down then stand on it to jump up another level. 

You can get on the top of the middle building in Backlot. It's not exactly hidden but not everyone knows about it. Jump out of the window onto a ledge then climb up the ladder

I think the game doesn't have many hidden areas, but it does have jumps you can use to access higher levels. Like the window in shoothouse office, Picaddily top floor shop window, some Petrograd windows, Arklov peak and Hovec Sawmill buildings etc can all be jumped up to from the outside"
"There's more than 1 building with a 2nd floor there. From his comment about 1 way in, sounds tllike the building with the bomb in SnD"
"BONK, go to campy jail"
I don�t really even go up there dude.  Just found it one time and thought it was interesting
It�s a cross of the m13 and mp7 I would say. The mp10
More like the MP20 IMO
MPX7
Actually its mp13
"As a gun guy, this hurts my heart."
Are we supposed to be impressed by you hiding like a little bitch and not trying to win the round?
lmao
Leave your fingers from the games or you will have to fix some parts of your life again soon.
"Still tons of players, I only really come back for shoot the ship cuz I�m also grinding obsidian on my favorites but definitely a lot of people still play. 

Cold War is ass, haven�t even touched it in like a month"
I play hardcore and find matches pretty fast so I can only guess that core is just as fast if not faster.
"I'd say get it, i enjoy it quite a lot. Matchmaking is usually very good"
"I would, I still really enjoy playing MW"
"I played world of Warcraft at a pretty high level for a while, it took over my life for the most part. I was in a really good hardcore guild raiding 5 nights a week 4 hours a night. I�d play all day just to farm and maintain my status as one of the best healing paladins on my server. I had to literally cold turkey that game to never go back and even now I still can�t go back or I will literally put all of my time into it."
Yes I got it last week for the first time and it's really fun
"I always play Hardpoint to get the fingers loose for Warzone and I never wait long for games. 

I played Cold War for a couple of months and haven't touched it in weeks."
"As someone who plays from CoD 1 (no CoD3 and none of the post-BO2 Treyarch titles bc they trash asf), even at the dilapitated state the game has been after the release of BOCW, it's still the smoothest CoD I've played. It does have its fair share of shenanigans from the devs, but the gameplay is unrivaled. When I started playing it I thought I'm back in MW2. When it came out. But my gun doesn't hurt my eyes bc I'm not shooting with my tongue. Real good shit.

Although I'd recommend watching gameplay to decide for yourself.  


EDIT: Oh yeah, finding a game... Well, it's great now, but if Activision keeps up with its finger-in-ass tactic of support, the playerbase might be reducing at some rate... Although if there's enough people to find a quick game now, after what they did with BOCW release... I'm sure the part of the playerbase that is left is unkillable. As long as Activision does not announce 'Shoot the Ship removed for life'."
It�s still a great game and better then Cold War where multiplayer is so much fun and campaign is a little questionable and spec ops is really fun with the addition of a wave mode

Did u complete marksman?
Did you get all the marksmans rifles? Both groups have to be gold.
You gotta do all of the marksman rifles too. They're in one category.
"I got it everyone, thank you"
"Here is a helpful link for what you need to get Damascus and the recital challenges

https://damascus.now.sh

Remember to have fun in the process, otherwise it is a grind.  When you�re doing the shield, slap a camouflage and keep it as your primary.  It helps tell people like me you�re grinding and I�m happy to pay it forward and help.  Just gave someone 15 kills earlier today and some were buzzkills."
You got all the Marksman rifle golds as well? You need those too for sniper platinums. Learned that last week.
Good luck man. It can get tiresome but stay strong. If you haven't already do the riot shield right now while you still have hardcore shoot the ship.
Thanks laddie
They�ve had these things called vault packs in the files forever just haven�t released them it�s all a bunch of stuff from season one pass kinda pricey but hope it comes out
"Let�s just hope they would eventually release it soon, seeing that they had finally started to release new packs like the Roze unmasked skin."
"Yeah they're supposedly releasing something called ""vault packs"" which you'll have to pay for but will let you access old seasons content."
Hopefully they come soon and aren't too expensive. I don't see the point in time locking content. The BP was 1000CP for 100 items. If they just release a few different packs for 1000 each that would be fair imo
"your team mate loaded into to the game before you and the game already started before you can load in and your teammate probably was doing a 1v2, I doubt there is cheat involved."
"that's not possible, i was playing with a person on discord and we loaded at the same time (we both play on the same console, ps4) and we were both surprised... it's really weird"
"Sick, try it without any grip, promise it still has no recoil"
"didn't know that, will do!"
"Its wayyyyy to easy on PC, this guy literally drop shot every person in this clip, doesn�t matter what gun you use when no one can hit you..."
I literally do the same thing on controller lmao I have paddles a jump every kill
Would love to see some of your clips on keyboard and mouse lol
"I�m not sure what your Uzi setup is but from one Uzi lover to another, I gotta share it so you can give it a try!

Setup:
- FSS Carbine Pro barrel
- .41 AE 32-Round Mag
- Monolithic Suppresser
- Commando Grip
- No Stock

Give it a shot and report back! It�s a damn laser"
"Just tried it without any grip and threw the laser on it for more ads speed, it's totally nuts at all ranges. Your setup would give me more movement speed too, will try!"
Hacks
Bruh this is just keyboard and mouse. Why is there always a comment like this from some dogshit console player who can't keep up
Yeah this is ...
Yeah you know. There are two player locations that you knew that I cannot explain with everything on your screen...
"*Clearly sees him miss the first fucking shot*
�Nah man but you checked that one spot where the guy was and I don�t know why you did clearly you�re hacking.�
Please give me a fucking break, this was a half a minute clip out of a whole game, is it that unreasonable for the guy to have been camping there earlier? And also why are you acting like your game sense is so out of this fucking world that you could tell everything that�s happening in the clip and if something is not what you expected, clearly he�s cheating?"
so you're saying what?
I got vtol an white phosphorous 2 games in a row but you make it look so damn easy
Still good though man!
Please don�t use white phosphorus. I despise it. I don�t understand how it�s even beneficial it blinds both sides and last so long and I always seem to get spawn killed the fire things. Obviously I can�t make you stop using it I just strongly dislike that killstreak is all
Nice aim
"i love the m13 its my 2nd most used gun behind the fennec 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM1RH5XXuPc 
this is a little clip i got with it, it was a shit shipment lobby but it shreds when i use it"
Longshots are fucking impossible unless they're AFK. Fuck the M13
Can get some on groundwar but other than that it's pretty aids lol
Hardcore shoot the ship
"Fun fact. In HC shoot the ship, it takes 2 headshots to kill in center lane iirc."
"More like 2022 if the leaks are true

>According to�*Call of Duty* leaker Tom Henderson,�*Call of Duty 2021* is being developed by Sledgehammer Games. Sledgehammer Games is the studio that led development on�*Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare* and�*Call of Duty: WW2*. Sledgehammer was originally supposed to be developing�*Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War* with Raven Software, but it was ultimately pulled from the project and Treyarch took lead development duties. 

[https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-2021-sledgehammer-games-leak/](https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-2021-sledgehammer-games-leak/)

Activision hasn't invested anything meaningful into Anti-cheat in a long time and with the yearly revenue CoD makes, I doubt that will change."
"While I completely agree with you, I�m a bit more optimistic this time around that Activision might try to be more supportive of its community after the lack of *overall* success Cold War had."
You know why COD4 was the best? Because you played on servers hosted by players under their rules with their map rotation and game modes and not this bullshit-lobby-we-change-everything-every-week type of play. Wanna play shipment 24/7 with knives only? Sure - there was a server for that. Cheaters weren't a problem on my server - sure you had them once in while - but it was only a matter of seconds to ban them from your server.
Exactly.  Player controlled servers were better than this Activision bullshit with map rotations.
"Watch out, I created a thread that said exactly this on launch and got downvoted and screeched at. These cats don't want to choose, they want to be spoonfed."
And stop adding the stupid fucking riot shield to every cod game
"Did you not okay MW2, Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, or World At War?"
I didn't like the BlackOps series.  Guns and movement felt wonky to me.  COD4:MW Promod was the best.
Lol blops 1. Is the king to to me then waw then mw2 the first modernwarfare is like 5th best lol
"We don't know for sure if the 2021 game will be another MW though. The way the trend goes, it seems to be BO, then futuristic, then WW2, then back to MW. So for all we know it could be another futuristic title to spice things up. I will say though that I wouldn't buy another futuristic or WW2 title. But they like to try new things with their games so we'll have to see."
The leaks suggest that it�ll be either about the Korean War or another ww2 game
"WW2 is a fun genre to play but everytime game makers develop a ww2 shooter, the maps have a lot of grey and lack vivid color IMHO.  I like the fact that most of the guns are fun to play and take skill, even though there is always one OP weapon that always slips through the balancing efforts and is dominating."
"Yea it�s probably gonna be mw2022, 2021 is gonna be a sledgehammer game."
Gross
"There's no good anti cheat in the market now, nothing will stop hackers coming in troves to CoD. Take as example extremely popular games, and i mean EXTREMELY.

Battlefield V
PUBG
Rainbow 6 Siege
Escape from Tarkov
DayZ
and a looooooooooooot more

All these games are flooded with cheaters and some have very strong anti cheats. There's no point other than making cheat creators wealthier. This is the fact. The ""harder"" the anticheat is, the more money hack creators ask for it, but the number of cheaters stays the same.

What they, and BFV are doing, is a good decision business-wise.
Like it or not, it is the way it is."
Spawn traps ruin game modes .
LMFAO
Easier to leave and re-join a new lobby than give others satisfaction!
"You should feel ashamed, and I'm not making an endearing reddit joke."
"Holy shit, and I thought the Shoot House one was bad, you got a fucking juggernaut from that"
Camping nerd
I would straight up leave the game. It's bad enough on Shipment lol.
What weapon is this?
Ole reliable AK-47
"I assume you were just doing longshots or something, because that�s the only time I go up there."
Only pussies do shit like this
You are a fucking liar if you say you wouldn�t kill people who just keep popping up In your sites
Geeez postin more hacks...yikes
what platform you play my man?
What�s this M4 setup?
"Corvus, mono silencer, merc grip, tac laser, forge tac stock"
"I assume by no footage of the last person, you didn�t clutch it ?"
It happened to me also and it�s the third time
Did you find a fix?
"I had to close the game and re-open it several times but in the end, i needed to redownload 2 of the 5 things it wanted."
No I want to know what to do
"Prepare for this to happen over and over by the way...randomly and yes it�s fucking infuriating and I wish it was fixed already.

I had to re-install data packs 4 times already the past month."
"If you�re sure you�ve downloaded everything, as I was, restart your ps4 and try opening MW again. Keep trying that it should eventually work. But make sure there aren�t any update files you haven�t downloaded yet first."
Pain
I use semtex the most out of all my lethals and this kinda stuff still happens to me every now and then.
"Never post a video with a shield and say, �This is how you play�"
If your team of 3 gets squad wiped by a single shielder that�s on you. Shields are easy to counter. Get good.
Well I did
"It�s only started happening since I put the game on my ps5. I�ve looked online but so far I can�t find a fix. It is cutting into my time playing shoot the ship this weekend and I really need a solution, if anyone knows one. Thanks"
Those are some good reaction times ngl.
God tier
Holy fucking shit son.... are you related to john wick by any chance?
Being able to buy it in the first place is a bug in itself
"Because that challenge text is bugged. You're supposed to use the renetti, not the skyov. Search ""skyov"" in this sub and you'll see."
Challenge for RAAL LMG is not racking either.
"Personally i am a good fan of the AK-47, it is my most used weapon (over 6000 kills and obsidian for it)"
"Man of culture i see i also play AK-47 im at 53200 kills with it and i love it,  its a under rated gun in my opinions."
"I love the kar98 and the kilo as one load out, very strong in my opinion"
Dmr with no scope
"Melee lmao. I�ve gotten them all obsidian with over 10k between them. Although if I had to choose between one of these, probably SMGs bc of the P90 and MP5."
"I love my assault rifles, in particular the automatic 556�s, but I can respect the AK too."
Rpgs
"Shotguns.


They�re the kings of cqc, PLUS its SUPER funny hearing manchildren whine about it when they try to fight me upclose with the spr"
"Bro your brightness

Please adjust it"
I posted the same as this a few weeks ago and back then I was with ya! Fortunately for me it feels normal again... sucks that you�re experiencing it now.
dude it�s so bad for me i literally had to get off just now. if anyone starts shooting at me and i try to run away i�m fucked. that NEVER used to be a problem for me before. i cant even explain how slow my movement feels it�s absolutely horrendous.
"Infinity Ward has been definitely tweaking the movement since the release of the game. Anyone who played Season 0-early 1 can remember how slow, yet eerily realistic the game felt. After the change, it started feeling much much faster which I did like and did get used to. I think the movement is okay right now."
"I noticed this today and wanted to see if anyone else had the same problem.

I only use 3 guns (fal, lever action, and kar).  I usually shoot 3-4 shots with fal to get a kill.  That is just how I do it.  Today it was 8-10 shots to get a kill.  I had to be really precise because the controls felt like I was not directly connected to game.  Movement was like my character was on ice.  At the same time I felt so slow.  It felt like it took ages to get shots off.   Getting shots off did not feel much better.  I had 20 assist on 11 kills and 18 deaths.  I was hitting people but could not get enough damage.

I did two of the daily things and turned it off.  I could not play."
So 3 OP guns did not carry you today? wow. Nothing in the game changed though
"Thanks, Gaz. My fruit-slaying skills ARE remarkable"
Was that dude with the shield trying to get a finisher on you?
I think he was trying to hit me with the shield
loadout on the pistol?
"Tac laser
Monolithic suppressor 
Rubber grip
Lightweight trigger
Perk: FMJ"
The first and most important lesson!
What do you have on that pistol?
"Tac laser 
Monolithic suppressor 
Rubber grip
Lightweight trigger
Perk: FMJ"

"Me, but with cold war"
"yeah its pretty unplayable, crashing a ton on my high end pc as well. black ops wont even start up without crashing period."
"Same here. I have to start up Black Ops at least three times now to actually open the damn game. Although mine's quite stable once I'm in the game. I think it's to do with how it loads MW as part of its main menu (i.e. you can open Black Ops and play Modern Warfare from its main menu, and vice versa)."
"Mine did that too, tried repairing, redownloading  the whole game, new video card driver, nothing worked. Ended up getting it working by going into the game settings and turning down the levels on various stuff until it worked again.  Worked fine for a couple weeks then it happened again.  Turned down settings again and now it�s working again. Think my video card had some sort of optimal setting for the game activated that dicked with my game settings and broke it but I still don�t know for sure the root cause because it worked great for like a year after buying the game."
I'd try driver downgrade
"I started playing MW since in the middle of Season 1 last year (Feb 23), and it was all smooth sailing for me. My game went through at least four hardware changes including one major one, the installation has been moved back and forth between multiple disks many times, and I went through all six seasons for the year without any frequent crashes whatsoever at all. Had maybe one or two rare crashes in my life...

All until the Season 1 ""refresh"" update that came out at the end of the year that brought in Black Ops into the loading screens and menus and changed the game icon from MW to Warzone. Everything's gone massively downhill for me from there. The game would start crashing to desktop with an error message after just two or three matches or so. A few patch updates later, it's become even worse. Now I can't play a single match without a chance that it will crash at all. The game has become totally unplayable for me. It's sooo bad to the point that when I start up the game, it now has a 66% chance of crashing right when, or even before the splash screen shows up. And it's even affecting Black Ops in the same way too, presumably since it is partially loading MW for its main menu. Very annoying.

When I try the scan and repair option, all it results in is an endless loop of scan then BLZBNTAGT00000BB8 error that I cannot get out of, until I either mess with the pause button on the updating part just before it turns into scan and repair, or delete these 1KB sized data files inside the data folder in the game folder as someone on a battle.net thread suggested to do when getting an error loop like this.

I'm going to reinstall my MW game for the first time soon since I still quite enjoy MW multiplayer and like it in some ways more than Cold War. Hopefully the reinstall fixes all these annoying glitches that even the scan and repair tool seems to have trouble with fixing. Just thought I'd share my story here, as all I could find on google about MW crashing after Season 1 update was just posts dating all the way back to late October 2020 or the Season 6 era. It took me some scrolling through this subreddit in the ""new"" order to find this post. Thanks."
"That game crashed nonstop from the time I bought it at release, to the release of cold war.  So glad to be done with it."
I�ve been debating if obsidian for my M4 would be less terrible than grinding Damascus
"It�s not that bad, just takes some time. I did it in a week, playing after work. I�m pretty sure if you get 30 kills with it in on game it counts as two 15 kill matches toward the 200."
Congratulations!  I�m working on that with my shield at the moment.
"I respect that, and trust me, it�s 101% worth it!"

This has happened to me as well since the latest update
I have also had non-stop split screen crashes. I�ve logged every match we tried to play this weekend and it�s roughly 50% of matches crash. Please open a ticket with Activision. We have been in touch with them and they�ll have a long ass email tomorrow with every match that worked and didn�t.
How do you open a ticket? That's what I was trying to figure out but their website just sent me to the subreddit
"Yep, us, too. Every time we open it, crash. Hope there's a resolution soon."
"Here is the link from another user to go and report the issue. It took me about three minutes, if you have the time, please do so to let them know this is a serious issue. Thanks!

Same on PS4
You can report it to the devs if you have the time! u/free table posted the link to their support page. Hopefully they resolve it soon

I don�t like the leathery taste though...
I think it�s all in how you prep it.
"Looking at the image and then how you described it, this could be taken in so many dirty ways."
"Looking a little closer, that looks like it would've hurt pretty bad lmao"
damn what are you doing (step)Kr�ger
O.      O.       F.
It's just a teaser for MW2 Electric Boogaloo
"*""Door stuck! Door stuck!""*"
Honestly it�s not looking good. Most new content will be warzone and cw
"I just wonder if they have to let cw do it�s thing for a bit and then mw can start releasing content again. Like an agreement, because if mw released new maps cw would definitely lose players."
"Favela would be awesome! Unfortunately, it's most likely not going to happen. Besides, they would just fill it with doors."
"I have always wanted Favela to come back since mw2, and now that I think of it imagine all the doors on invasion"
"2 new 6v6 and 2 new gunfight maps are coming. Rumoured march, theyve been in the files since December though"
"They are using MW just to advertise the trash that is CW.

The devs fail to understand that those still playing MW prefer MW and not CW."
"If they give you too much content, they won�t have any for MW2 Which inevitably comes out the end of this year.  

I love MW and I�m enjoying CW.  I didn�t think I would, but It�s worth a shot."
Next year
I upgraded RAM for my biggest improvement. I had only been running 8GB.
"There isn't usually a definitive way to straight up boost your FPS unfortunately, at least not a considerable degree.

There are however some things you can do if you haven't already done so, to give yourself a tiny improvement:

Make sure in your nvidia control panel, your power mode is set to prefer maximum performance. You can mess around with a few of the other settings in here specifically for MW too if you go to program settings. Don't know how effective they'd be though.

Set your game priority to above normal or high in task manager (Never set it to realtime as this makes things unstable)

Make sure your game is in fullscreen - this reduces input lag and does increase FPS since you're not rendering in anything in the background.

Overclocking - if your PC isn't currently overclocked, you could, if you are comfortable, OC either your GPU or CPU. Again, only do this if you are comfortable with doing it, and know what you're doing.

All in all though, the best way to increase FPS is unfortunately just to get better hardware, but I tried to offer some things that I used to do when I had a 1060."
"MW by default launches at High Priority. Changing to Normal is go to, plus RAM management software to stop stutters."
"Disabling highlights should help a little, as for the rest, closing as many background tasks as possible and disabling windows 10 game mode should help. You should also make sure that VRAM usage is well below what's available. Turning off some features like ambient occlusion and particles, some things that may seem have little impact but can definitely improve performance.

You might also want to lower your render resolution."
"Lower render res
Run fullscreen
Turn off Win10 game mode /(Ansel - a background capture feature)
Lower shadows, highlights, particles, turn off depth of field


More RAM ( I went 8 to 16 and it definitely prevents what rare stutter I got)

Edit: also, probably not applicable but people with higher end hardware that run higher settings have found it beneficial to use a framelimit to encourage smoothness.
I recall in older games that could help too even if the frsme limit was set to something like the average rhe system would achieve anyway. 


Update gpu drivers


And pro tip, I had bad stutters related to outdated drivers but in troubleshooting, I enabled in general settings the on screen display for cpu and gpu delays 
Which tell me in milliseconds where my bottlenecks were. I zeroed in on driver issurs since both my cpu and gpu were consistently no more thab 10 ms"
"I don�t know the exact math, but suffice to say that this is a known thing and not (apparently) a bug."
"Thats lame, why tf they doing this?"
"I only experienced it in STS, but shipment is the only map where i get around 60 kills, maybe it�s in every gamemode/map. After 40-50 kills the xp gain per kill becomes lesser"
"Apparently its not a bug, why would they do that"
Lmao the games life cycle is over if you think this is gonna happen then idek
"I don't care too much, but just in case they wanted to leave the game in good terms. This game had a lot of potential."
Remove and redesign every map? This has to be a shitpost. No way you're serious. The games life cycle is over. Cold War is out and the next COD will be out this October like they are every year. They won't change anything from your list.
They don't need to change. MW2019 isn't Black Ops 4
"cool.   later

r/CODbitching"
"I assume, you're a camper in this game?"
ReMaKE thE GAmE TO SuiT Me
It should suit all the players. Not just the campers waiting for a kill like the rats they are.
"You lost me with number 2 bro. It sucks how much time these devs put into the game and youre out here literally telling them to remake all of the damn maps in the game except for one? Like I know there are some sucky Maps but I sure do try to appreciate all of the hardwork that was placed into making them. Also, not every game you play is gonna be insane, sometimes you gotta win but you gotta lose too. It�s how things balance themselves out. If you can�t handle that, don�t play any competitive games"
Here�s an idea for you OP; take those ideas and shove them up your butt
"I'm sick of campers in this game. You need to man up and play like a regular guy, not like a sucker."
Why anyone even bother to post shit like this?
My guy what
"What are you talking about? The cycle is over, at this point they should give us just the 3 missing weapons and the option for map selection instead of weekly playlists. And the ttk should stay how it is, it�s perfect in my opinion"
"I mean, I by no means think this game is bad. It's also not a masterpiece either. It's just, decent. A pretty good time sink.

I agree that some of the camo challenges suck, and some of the maps aren't great, but a lot of the things you've described are all personal preference. I personally would hate it if ADS speed was longer. I think longshot kills challenges are only an issue on some guns, like SMGs, but crouch kill challenges do suck, yeah. Surprised you didn't mention mount kills in there.

In the end though, the game is past it's life cycle now. None of what you want will be changed. And even if it wasn't past it's life cycle, none of what you want would get changed either, because you're an individual with an opinion. Just because this is what you want, doesn't mean it's what the majority want, or what the devs want."
"I meant to say decrease the ads time, sorry. I know that it won't be changed but it's still a damn shame though. The game engine is good and kills feel satisfying, but the overall experience is just held back by the developers intentions to make this game a paradise for beginners and campers. It's just such a shame, it could have been way more.

It could have been the cod to beat all cod's and make this game their rainbow six of the series with constant updates, new stuff and else. But the core elements are holding it back."
"Not gonna happen.

I usually block people for 3 reasons:

\- Camper  
\- Shotgun/As-Val idiot  
\- Cheater

Just block whoever you think it's not ok to you."

What if I want to play Gary Roach-Sanderson?
"Otter is Roach

Edit: allow me to explain. In cliffhanger level MW2 towards the end Roach hops on the green snowmobile. In this MW there was a bundle for Roach that has a weapon charm, that weapon charm is a green snowmobile."
I like the changed iron sights on the m4 it looks better than the regular iron sights
How do you change the iron sights?
"Best blueprints imo. The pistol was kinda bad, but you can change it up and make it okay to use as a backup. The Task Force M4 though, that is a beast."
And more importantly it applies camo better than your average skins including stock skin.
"I use it purely for the nostalgia factor. The M4A1 in MW2 was by far my favourite weapon, and terribly underrated. It was more than capable of going toe to toe with TAR-21s and UMPs alike, and was better than the ACR as well imo."
Put a compensator on it and its god tier
i use this variant with platinum skin and i make it look like the 1911 from bo1
backup? i use the M1911 in a certain configuration as my main weapon
"Why they brought another 1911 blueprint is beyond me. Not only that, they didn't even do what they did with the M4 and make it look like the 1911 in cod 4/MW2, just some random arse model. Such a waste."
"The best thing about this bundle is if you put the pink topo camo on the One For One blueprint, it makes the grip gold."
"There is also a bundle called war pig, a reference to the mission from cod 4 and the tank itself"
I got that bundle it�s nice asf mp5 and m4 both with tracer round s
Plus the tan 1911 blueprint with War Pig scratched onto the slide.
Where do you get these blueprints from?
Buying MW2 Campaign Remastered.
"""Welcome to the 141. Best handpicked group of warriors on the planet""- Shepherd to our boy Allen before sending him to die at the airport"
Dont remind me man
How you get these
They come w/ the MW2 Remaster.
Same with the Kilo 141
The ghost gun is good imo
"Fun fact here: the Task Force blueprint does not have the correct rail system on it from MW2, it instead has a basic KAC rail system with rail covers on it. The Rail system that was on the MW2 M4 is called the S.I.R. from Armalite. I was so disappointed that it wasn�t on the final MW19 blueprint. I still use the shit out of it despite that, cause dammit I love the classic SOPMOD look. 

One other thing of note: I wish they would�ve just added the USP handgun to the game and then making a MW2 blueprint based off the in game model from MW2."
I didn't simply because I never used the pistol.
If I got MW2 remastered for free from ps plus do I still get the bundle?
"Nope sorry, the bundle only comes with buying the game. Bit cheap of Activision to do that."
"I guess I'm the only one who don't get it, being absent from the scene since mw1 back in the day until warzone came out."
"Task Force 141 is the name of the group in MW2, with Captain Price, Soap etc"
I never noticed lol.
The 1911 wasn't even in mw2 multi
True. It was in the single player campaign though
What challenge is this??
Not a challenge. It's the bundle that you get for buying MW2 campaign remastered. Also comes with an MW2 ghost skin
I mean It was spelled out for me twice yet still the first 30 seconds I stared at this post I didn't get it.
"Iconic Tbh As the 1911 is the one that killed Zakhaev in MW2007
MW2 M4 is probably the Most Used gun in next to the ACR and Intervention"
Being a ghost player i have to agree it took me 3 minutes to realise that
"They should have added a MW2 Blueprints for AK-47,  MP5, X16 and EBR-14."
Kinda upset the m4 wasn�t made to look like ghosts ACR

Exactly. Rook should be adjusted with a bright red gag-ball to complete the gimp look tbh. And auto-mute their users' mic since she's gagged anyway
As a former roze skin I moved on to the default or price dead of night skins.roze dark is just a reason for people to sweat when they see your skin
Did you really think people were choosing Roze for any other reason besides this fact? lol
"And I'm going to use this one just to spite them.

Now all I have to do is git gud enough to sweat."
�The most mysterious operator� excuse me but have you forgotten about ghost Nikito and velekan
-insert Velikan laugh-
Don�t forget Grinch either.
"I think the sentence isn�t complete,it was supposed to be �Shadow Company�s most mysterious operator�,so Nikto doesn�t make sense 

But I definitely agree about Velikan"
"I like how the blueprints in this bundle have the Acid effect. It's fitting because Roze is the most toxic operator, and the devs have made it canon."
Every time I die by a camping Roze and I hear �Got that bitch� I get so mad

[deleted]
I mean the whole post-campaign story is pretty dumb compared to the campaign. Alex surviving and getting a metal leg is a world away from the gritty realism of the campaign.
"Warzone is a simulation. Only Consider all the Season intels and cinematics as canon.
so MW's story ended with Season 6 and the cinematic with Nuke stopped and Victor dead.

What happen after the integration with CW are not MW canon but are now BOCW canon."
"The ship bought zombies with it and there was a cutscene for it, is that canon to the sotryline"
"Its more than likely nova 6, not actual zombies seeing as in the transmissions u hear people dying but no gun shots or moans from zombies. All we know is that they found concealed chemical weapons."
Will there be a zombies mode in mw?
"No, zombies already over on mw, it only for all black ops."
Maybe just add everything that increases ADS...
"best quickscoping setup for the ax-50 is : 17.0 factory barrel, tac laser, singuard arms assassin stock, stippled grip, and the Focus perk.

"ZLR asp
Tac laser

Lapua mag"
"AX-50: shortest barrel, stock that decreases ADS speed, grip that decreases ADS speed, tact laser, scope (up to you) or perk (u to you)

SPR: 3rd stock, 10-R mag, red dot sights (any but avoid those 3x and above scopes) , chamber speed increase attachment and slight of hand perk

I'd recommend AX-50 for quick scoping... SPR does a fuck tons of hit markers if you don't aim for the head."
"I run monolithic, 50 round drum, no stock and sleight of hand"
"for the spr208 add the asp barrel,  sniper scope, either stock which increases ads speed, .338 lapua mag ammunition, and either a commando foregrip or fmj or slight of hand"
"The moment a person realizes that kd is kinda meaningless in the long run, the more fun they'll have playing any video game."
Yeah I just mentioned to someone that I�m trying to not care about it anymore and just enjoy the game. Used to find myself frustrated after getting killed more than I was killing. I should be having fun not being upset.
They thing is ppl can view your kd some I feel good when you see my multiplayer kd is 1.17 then you go to warzone and it�s .56 /;
"Some people care more about winning than having a decent ratio. Often taking objectives means your K/D suffers, whereas focusing on kills means your W/L suffers. In TDM the Objective is to kill people, meaning its based entirely on who's better at killing people. Whereas objective gamemodes often require you to take an objective to win, and killing people just makes it easier for you and harder for the other team. So it's not entirely about who's a better at killing, but more a better Objective player, since you don't need to kill people to hop on Obj. I suppose  K/D and W/L are just for dick measuring. 

Personally I dont really care about either, I like having a high K/D just because I like killing people more than I like dying. But it doesn't stop me from playing Obj, plus often W/L is reliant on teammates. You shouldn't worry about either, because they hold no actual value."
Cool. I used to think a high KD meant you�re a good player but I�m trying to get out of that mindset and just enjoy the game.
"It's not just S&D. I normally play 10v10 tdm mainly because it's a single gamemode. I've been playing Stir Crazy this week and it's mostly people ignoring objectives and running around for kills. I had one game of hardpoint where one person had 85+ kills and not a single second capturing a hardpoint. 

K/D is meaningless to me because it's not a true measure of skill. Mine is just above 1.2 because I play the objective and I don't care if [I get killed trying](https://iili.io/fjQKva.png). I get way more satisfaction from winning the round than if I have some insane K/D ratio. Plus I play against fewer sweets likely due to my lower K/D."
"Wow! You carried the whole team on that match!
I hear you man. It sucks to lose the match."
what ima say is if everybody kills more people than dies on your team its gonna be hard to lose
"Nope

[https://iili.io/fjQKva.png](https://iili.io/fjQKva.png)"
"I think that only applies to TDM, obviously. I�ve seen plenty of objective games where the winning team had significantly less kills than the losing team. People play objective games and spawn trap or just don�t play the objective but rather focus on kills"
I�m all about w/L idgaf about my kd same for warzone
"None of those ratios matters. Sure they might be a good indication of your progression but other than that it's pretty much useless. If you went from a 0.8 k/d to a 1 k/d it probably means you got better but like mentioned by others a high k/d dosen't mean you play the objective. It could also mean you camp in a corner and never help your team. That dosen't require much skill either.

If i play TDM i usually look at my K/D to evaluate my performence in that game but my overall K/D really dosen't say anything. If dying can bring a strategic advantage to my team i will. That said you will hear a lot of people talking about their K/D like it's their baby. They will usually let your team loose a game cause they dosen't want to push and damage their ratio.

As for W/L it means nothing in this game. The matchmaking seems to throw you in hard matches when you win games and easy matches when you loose. So really what does this ratio say when the game controls who you play against? If the matchmaking was random then you could conpare but comparing riged numbers is useless."

"I had the same thing with Capture The Flag recently.

I'd gotten into a bit of a rut of just grinding for Obsidian in Free-For-All matches and Shoot/Ship when it was around, maybe occasionally throwing in a round of dickin' around in tanks in Ground War when I got too bored of grinding.

But a couple weeks ago I got into Capture The Flag again and I had completely forgotten just how much more it gets your blood moving than other modes. 

SnD and Cyber Attack sometimes have the same effect. Like a physical rush sensation, similar to when you're really into a sports game on TV and your team gets on a breakaway that could change the outcome of the game. 

It's a visceral feeling that you really lose when you get stuck in a rut of grinding for camos.

Reinforce also had that same effect. I really wish they'd add that as a permanent mode in the Core and Hardcore filter lists."
I completely agree. Cold War had me so down. Playing it makes me absolutely livid. MW got stale for me though specially after playing for so long. Now that I play SND it�s like a breath of new life. I�ve made entirely new classes and have to think more about movement. I like it a lot. Having rush routes and all the smack talk really make me feel like the MW2 and MW3 days.
"I agree 100%. There's a reason MW S&D content is still going extremely strong on YouTube with Futives, Jolt & Handler. The game feels like it was made for S&D. I detest respawn modes in MW because the spawns are messed up and they're too big for 6v6 respawn, but it absolutely works with S&D."
it was really nice of you to include me in here :)
Yessssssssssss it�s insane. The spawns are horrible. Knowing where the energy will spawn gives me comfort lol
Slayed????
All the players you mentioned are mediocre at best
"Honestly MW feels like it was made for search. So many of the bad maps for dom and tdm feel really good on snd, Grazna Raid is probably my favorite original"
I truly believed that the maps in MW were absolute shit. Now that I play SND they are amazing. Except for that docks map with only two lanes. That map is aids. But still I like these maps more than Cold War.
"I don�t play any other game mode besides search, only for camos. It�s been that way since I played mw2 and mw3. 

I�ve already proven to myself that I can get high killstreaks. I don�t see the fun in playing a mode where you respawn and the guys you kill respawn. Like you said, the aspect of being dead for the round when you�re killed makes things more fun. Whether you�re playing competitive or trolling, people staying dead when they die makes it more fun"
Search or nuttin�!

"Honestly, these into animations are one of the main reasons why I love this game, the transition feels so smooth and badass. Cold war try but their animations make no sense half the time, and dont give you that war time feeling. Hopefully the next Modern Warfare has them, and I wouldn't mind more variety, maybe a Halo drop intro."
"I agree with what you said, but I do love the Miami intro for the team that comes in a van just something about then crashing and driving recklessly seems badass"
Cold war operators straight up just ignore inertia
Exactly. More variety would be cool

Its meant to say renetti
Still Sykov isn't in the game
"Skyov is from getting pistol kills in mp if I remember correctly, that's just to unlock akimbo for renetti but there's a glitch with the name"
This has been a bug ever since the sykov has been able to be accidentally unlocked.
"Based on the blueprints I have:

""Anole"" MP5 

""Galapagos"" M13

(both come in same bundle)

Both of those keep like a tealish tint to the gun when obsidian is applied. Honestly tho, both the mp5 and M13 looks extremely good with platinum camo on it vs obisian with the teal being super bright on top the platinum, giving them an unique look.

""Kuudere"" Famas 

""Tsundere"" MP7

""Yandere"" Kilo

(all 3 come in same anime pink tracer bundle)

These keep like a super dark pink, almost purple looking tint to it when obsidian is applied. Hardest to tell on Famas out of the 3.

""1776"" M4

(red, white, blue tracer pack)

Has both like a dark crimson and super dark navy blue embedded into obsidian. The magazine is also dark navy blue.

""Prototype: Alpha"" Grau

""Prototype: Omega"" Mp7

(both come in purple tracer pack)

These have a dark purple tint to the obsidian camo. Harder to tell on these two but it looks clean on certain parts of Verdansk.  

Thats all I have, its usually the tracer packs that do some time of alteration to the obsidian but there are some one offs, such as that M13/Mp5 pack"
Thanks! That anole/Galapagos look dope in obsidian. Now I just have to wait for it to show up in my shop since it doesn�t seem to be available in the shop or armory atm. I guess I�ll use this time to grind the m13 for obsidian. Thanks a lot!
"https://i.imgur.com/Ki9POhu.jpg

you should have slipper from last season"
"Dope, I didn�t even realize that. I was only using the Al Rukh because it has tracers and didn�t even think to look at the clutch. I also already have it in obsidian which saves time. Thanks a lot!"
"There was one, an m13 I believe called Galapagos or something. It�s the lizard one. It looks pretty good with Obsidian applied. It has the greenish/blue tint under the obsidian design and looks almost like a gem. Saw someone post it a couple months back."
"Anime Super Tarcer Pack : Mp7 and Kilo have a Pink Light in Obsidian.

One of Mp5 blueprint (i dont know the bundle name) have a blue light in obsidian too."
My ax50 is almost obsidian I have the m19 and just got amax finished but my favorite skin is the ax50 lonely lagoon I use that blueprint with the fire skulls skin looks sick
"But do any of them look good in obsidian is what I�m asking. As in specific blueprints with obsidian equipped. Like do you know of any that aren�t just pure black with obsidian or stand out in one way or another? For example, the tower blueprint for the KAR has a gold scope and the rest of the gun is obsidian."
"Yes and right now is the best time to do it.

Hardcore shoot the ship.

When you get Shipment, camp inside the middle container. Bump people off as they run by. You might have to run out of the container to catch up to your opponents but once you give 'em a nice bop, book it back to the container.

The beauty of hardcore is not only is it 1-hit kills, but no killcams so they will have to be truly aware to find out where you're coming from."
I agree on this one also a good spot is a Office on Shoothouse just camp the stairs door near the containers and when u hear a footsteps on stairs rush them. Must be HC and use claymores to cover ur back.
"Deffo swap the 100 round mag out, that�s ok for duos, trios etc on wz but slows you down on mp. Try swapping the back grip for a blue dot and go for the headshots too"
"I�m at 150/200 with the kilo for obsidian, I�m using the same build I use for search - (whisper barrel, merc foregrip, 60 round mags, rubberised grip, no stock) I think it got nerfed recently as it doesn�t feel near as strong as it used to.."
"Yeah i think it is, cuz i remember it was better than this. Its my 32th gun for Obsidian and its 80/200 for me now."
"I find the kilo really weird. My second favourite gun (after RAM) but I find it so inconsistent.
Sometimes it slaps, other times it's a hitmarker machine.

In terms of hardcore, it seems really weak close up but awesome at long range.

And a but on obsidian. It's really disappointing that it covers up the Union flag on the Union Black variant (my preferred one). Why?"
"Weirdly the gun should be a 2 shot kill at all ranges in HC, and one shot to the head up to 50+m 

It might feel worse when you're up against 1 shot kills weapons, or maybe the gun build you have is too bouncy so some shots miss (like no stock attachment)"
i think it does. but the nice thing about it it have a pink shade when u cover that pink blueprint from anime super bundle with obsidian.
"For HC id build it for speed. 

Whisper barrel, Merc, stippled, close quarters stock, then either an optic, SOH (unnecessary on kilo imo), or tac/5mw laser 

I don't think 50 rounds are needed on HC, let alone 100"
"Hardcore is more geared for an ADS and fast RPM build, as compared to Core where you want a high damage and moderately fast RPM build

The Kilo is pretty solid in Core, but faster weapons like the MP7, AS VAL, and the Fennec/Vector will crush it in Hardcore"
"Thank you for explaining. I used the longest Barrel and its better now. It seems Damage Range affect the TTK too much, cuz same thing happened for mp7 too, when i used monolith Suppressor and long barrel it got very powerful."
Better yet: Just fucking keep MW2019 and expand on it instead of taking a huge dump on it.
No money in that. Better money to make a new game so u have to buy it again
"No thanks Satan, you�re literally asking for all the garbage parts of the MW to be kept in. They did a lot of stuff right with MW 2019, but everything on your list was a mistake lol. Except tac sprint, that�s acceptable. I don�t really like it but it�s not a big deal. Compass isn�t a big deal either but it is if they keep the mini map the way it was in MW 2019."
Hahahaha!!! These are the exact things everyone wanted removed this Time last year. Fuck this community is trash

"Hi, I think there is a bug in Shoot House map when using the POS-M3 Thermal Scope on the AN-94 assault rifle. In the other maps it is possible to see the environment with a blue tint and enemies are displayed red-ish (unless they are using cold blood which they appear blue). 

However, in Shoot House I notice that the details of the map disappear and everything looks like a blue constant. This makes it very difficult to aim and recognize the environment around especially if someone is running cold blooded they are basically invisible. I noticed this only on shoot house, all the other maps look fine.

See image for details"
Not a bug. I mean that's how thermal works. Same goes to IRL thermals but in game they used a different kind of thermal.

"The real question is, why did you buy the battlepass this season in the first place?

Unless you play warzone and use the CW/WZ exclusive unlocks extensively (in which case, you're better off posting in r/warzone about it), the battlepass litterally has no other merit than the cod points and double xp tokens for MW multiplayer.

Still, I agree with you that the past 2 weeks have been severely undermining those who don't have that much time to play in the first place. There is one consolidation at this time though: you get double battle pass progress when you play warzone. Personally I highly recommend plunder (or blood money) in that case."
"Not OP but I literally got the battle pass for the extra points. I had the points lying around and said fuck it why not.

However when the XP bug took hold, I decided that Season 1 would be my last battle pass and just blew the rest of my points on the 4th of July bundle. I should have been done with the battle pass pretty much the day the bug started. Instead it took me an extra week, with no communication and expectation that it might be permanent. Not taking that risk again."

If you can't find the bundle you want on the store page, make sure to check the armory. Most, but not all blueprint and operator bundles can be found there. Browse through the weapons at the bottom of the list (they have a pricetag symbol that is greyed out) to see if the bundle is available.

Like everyone said hardcore is crucial if you're trying to get pistols done as fast as possible. Finished damascus the other day pistols was one of the easiest to do.
"I started doing that a few minutes ago, not only is it easy it's extremely fun using pistols on hardcore I've never had so much fun with pistols in this game."
[removed]
"Yep, I'll get damascus sooner or later but for now I want gold for all the pistols."
"All Multiplayer Packs and All of the Data Packs 

But i heard PS5 is broken right now and it will uninstall your packs after a while making you download them again"
"unfortunately you heard right, this shit happened to me just right now"
"set dpi to 3200, reduce sens to 2. a higher dpi is generally better for input"
"Tried it out, it is still happening"
"You mentioned you used to use XIM. What is your mouse's polling rate? It should be at 1k. Try unplugging your controller, then restarting your PC entirely before launching the game. Do not plug your controller back in during this period. It definitely sounds like the game is simply confusing your inputs."
"1000hz, on a Logitech G-Pro. I've tried rebooting with the controller unplugged but the issue still proceeds"
"Open up Task Manager, right click MW, go to details, right click MW again, set priority to Normal.    I've been having the same issue and found this works for me.  Also, check your Windows mouse settings (Pointer Options) to make sure Enhance pointer precision isn't enabled.

also, you're gonna have to do this every time you open MW because it defaults to High priority for some reason."
"I think this is solved! 

I forgot to turn it on Normal and it started again, I went ahead and turned it to normal then the issue went away. Works like a dream

Many thanks!"
maybe try 1600-3000 dpi and very low in game sens
Isn't xim4 cheating?
yeah but this was 6 years ago

"These two geniuses clearly don�t realize that all MW content has the black ops season 1 subheading including MW operators.

This vehicle isn�t even in black ops."
So cw isn�t part of warzone now?
"I hate that there is all this BOCW crap in MW, like come on, they�re different games made by different people, get it off my screen"

"Ah yes, I love driving this vehicle in Black Ops."
Literally says Black Ops. And MW already has a black set.

They're just getting their longshot challenges
Why are almost all of them bale.
I know that sometimes lobbies can be bad but holy shit is this an amputee lobby?
Lovely
Same thing happened to me. Oof.
"I have the same bug, cost me 3 tournaments already"
Cost you? I meant to say that I never start the tournament. It�s just stuck on 4 operators walking in the lobby

Why would I post if I'm cheating lol
You dookie.
I don't know how long this will survive. It looks like posts containing complaints about this game get automatically deleted pretty soon.
The only thing that�s going to get fixed is it showing up in your game. These won�t track unless you buy the vault packs or operator packs. They aren�t just giving these away for free.
what's a vault pack and how can I access them? I've got some useless cod points to spend
My guess since u didn�t actually get the ability to unlock them before u can�t now.
"it is possible, i started doing some challenges for price a few weeks ago before the update"
Its just because of the vault packs that aren't out yet. You'll be able to buy them soon hopefully.
No way they will release old battle passes for free. It will be in 20 dollar packs.
Depends on game mode and playstyle. I assume this is for multi as you have over kill in tier C. Havent touched Mp since last July when I finished Damascus so hard to remember but Id agree that ghost and eod are top tier. I used to run Hardline for UaV spam/keep a count for the 3kills w/o dying camo challenge
"high alert should be A tier or higher, that perk has saved my life an ungodly amount of times.

edit=typo."
OP has definitely not used high alert before
overkill on C!?
imo besides WZ or search it doesn�t have a purpose
i would switch battle hardened with spotter and move overkill up to A rank
*BONK*
The way she falls *oof*
"Was that a ricochet I just witnessed ?


Edit : Bro this game is nuts. WTF was that shit. XD"
And now we know the defuse time is exactly 4:57 seconds from the time the animation opens the case and shows the clock.  I paused the video and it showed you opened the case with 4:56 left on the clock.  This means since it was successful and ended in zero seconds you had exactly :01 time to spare.  I'm guessing the full animation is probably 5 seconds exactly.
4:59 look again
Bruh. It�s not that serious.
Anxiety must've been high on that one
Nice

"Jesus christ, you kidding me? Look at this crap. Theres gotta be a million wires here. I'm more of a 3 wire kinda guy."

What a God
If anyone knows how to transfer from an Xbox yet me know.
"I give you Seal award cuz I feel bad, lol that's like the worst one I coulda used."
What rifle is this?
It�s the Kar98k
Lucky enough to get a 2 person collateral kill with the Kar98..? You'll get plenty more in time
Also the 2 semtex kills making it a quad feed
lmao its just a collateral with a kar98 i get that every week
Yeah I�ve got many collats but the timing with the Semtex to make it a quad feed was lucky af
"I did all my launchers on shoot the ship, rpg was actually the quickest to get."
Is there any specific strategy you used?
"If it's just aerial killstreaks, you can hit them by leading your shots. If you need help, there are plenty of youtube tutorials to guide you to do it."
"If you're in my lobbies all of them, apparently.."
You can try free fo all in hardcore mode.  I hear they run personal UAV�s frequently there
"I did mine in shipment
But you can do it on ground war destroying uav and helicopters"
"Common comments I hear while playing SnD.

""Oh I didn't know I had bomb"". Like wtf bomb literally spawns in the exact same place every single game. If you don't want to grab it don't simple. Also when you grab it there's a audio queue and a voice line saying ""You have the FUCKING BOMB!""

""We planted the bomb/I didn't know we planted"" like wtf again. There's a voice line that plays saying the bomb as been planted. Not to mention there's a constant noise of the bomb ticking down.

Also if you have bomb don't fucking rush the enemy spawn with it and lose it."
"yep, i played with this dude on my team before, and he done the exact same thing, on the same map, got bomb and sat in market ads with a sniper.

or when teammate plants bomb and goes looking for the last kill and the enemy is defusing,
swear every other game i get these kinda teammates"
"In fairness to them, you can mute the person that calls that stuff out, I usually do as it just adds to the noise I don't need but I take an active role in being aware of those things because I know I've muted that voice."
To be fair I�ve played SND a lot on every cod since MW2 and still have occasionally forgotten that I had the bomb.
I would say at least half of the people in matchmaking are stoners sooooo
I love rainbow six and the same shit happens all the time
Some people can zone out and just not hear the audio queue or the ticking. I believe it's called something like selective hearing.
"Some people play with no sound. Granted, it�s not smart to play S&D with no sound, but people do it anyways."
I actually don't play with audio. I find it more enjoyable to play while watching yt or something tbh
It�s not that deep dude
"Idk about most people but I�ve had announcer voice muted since like 2 days after the game came out, your only argument is �there�s a voice line� as if people listen to that shit lol"
I wish we could've heard the game chat
I don�t understand why people have to exploit everything. Just play the fackin game normally man.
Right! Man I've gotten 15 guns obsidian all legit just for a trash can to pay 10 bucks and get every camo and blueprint unlocked lol like how is that not detectable..
"I am pretty sure those ""Cool"" guys being ""cool"" about those cheating are also cheating themselves. 

They are talking as if people pursuing fairness are losers. Thank god, in general these people do not get to be leaders in companies or governments."
"in MP: 2 day old account with damascus, hacked calling cards/emblem, aimbot/walling.

joke. abs joke

at least I executed him while he was in his gunship"
Haha nice! The camos exploiting is whatever but the fact people are still cheating in mw multi is fucking disgusting lol
"Just because someone is level 10 this season doesn't mean they bought a hacked account. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's definitely not always the case either. With CW season 1, levels were reset to 1 (although some people started out at 4 or 7) and they may have just stopped playing for a while and are now returning because of STS"
Of course there are new people's but I'm only talking about the low levels under 55 with obsidian on every gun def a hacked account lol
I've seen them legit every lobby in search
"CW reset everyone�s ranks to 1. Likely they just haven�t played in a while.

Still a chance they bought an account, but I feel that wouldn�t be as common."
'Whats the point?' Because you can take pride in the fact you didn't take the scrubby route and actually earned em. Who cares what everyone else is doing. Just do you
I'm def not gunn pay for them that's wack af I said what's the point of working for them activision clearly don't give a fuck then why should I haha
"If it's 10 bucks i mean i'll take it.

Camos and having everything unlocked is least of my concerns,  i just wish there was more content in this game."
Imagine that hit on his nut on final killcams
There is deff some flash nade mw2 kill cams. They look so goofy.
"Aw man, that would have been legendary."
Killed people with hits lots of times lol.
"I do that all the time with grenade launchers, but I don't use them a lot anyways and I have never done that with a flashbang ever."
I believe tactical nades do 14 damage in hardcore so theres a good chance you could repeat it. but good aim otherwise
"I am still so confused. I mean.... wow! Thanks for the explanation though. But I wasn't in HC, you can tell because I got a HUD and everything."

"+1.

Also I�d like a feature to play soundtrack during matches. I really wanna listen to the season 2 theme while playing, idk why but it would be a pretty cool feature to add in, doubt its gonna happen any time soon though..."
You can get the spotify app on consoles to play music while you play. Doesn't have season Thebes though just the full launch soundtrack
Shit really starts to get real once the season 2/3 theme starts playing mid-game. Thats when you know this is serious.
Would love a music player like cold war does
"They just added the lobby music from BO, gotta get that MW3 music"
one BIG thing they should but forgot to do before moving to whatever they're doing.
so much this!
"I fucking love the music theme there is right know, but i do understand. There should be an option to change it."
"This is one of the reasons why I like Pubg, you can change the season themes and musics, hope they do the same in this game(if they even bothered)"
"Season 6 theme is the best so I�m fine with it, but I would like that option since I miss both season 4 theme and launch day/season 0 theme."
"Sorry to highjack your post, but are submissions manually approved? Why can't I see the video I posted here? I posted one on another account about a day ago and it never showed up. Posted it again on this account and still never showed up. Nothing in the rules says anything relevant...."
"Great question, im not sure. Ive had the same problem happen to me before."
Speak for yourself I�m fine with the season 6 theme.
"So you agree? You�d like the option to choose a season, because you could just choose season 6?"

This is amazing for your age I�m 23 and the best I can do is a stick man you could go really far with this man keep it up
"My best attempt https://i.imgur.com/OPnelY0.jpg
You are absolutely amazing."
Your brightness is too high
"Yeah I play in a dark room, it kind of don�t have any lights , and when I turn the side lights on it�s too bright and I can�t see anything"
That scope is disgusting
Hes probably trying to unlock some reticles for that scope
"Yeah I�m trying to unlock reticles rn, I gotta get 50 headshots"
[This video](https://youtu.be/BlPOD5dVV6A?t=322) will explain everything wrong with obsidian/challenges in general. Basically Progression and challenge tracking in MW is buggy af and always has been. With XP and BP progress too. He has other vids on this as well. Usually restarting your game will make the server kick in and update your game
I restarted didn�t work sadly
Did you get kills with any lethals or killstreaks? Or your secondary gun? Sometimes for me it would count the previous game like if I ended at 13-14 kills it would count towards the challenge
Nope I never use anything else other then the mp7
I�ve been working on the kilo for week I have over 4000 kills and you�d think that would mean something but I still need to do it like 40 more times
"welcome

imagine grinding obsidian xbow and 25% of the games over 15 kills didn't count other 25% isn't even long enough/join in progress where it ends before you can get 15.

if you're doing all weapons it's the most painful journey in cod history."
IKR the riot shield is rough to do as well
"yeah this is quite common with the obsidian grind, just restart your game and the progress you have made should show then."
It didn�t work I had to make up a few rounds
"Try resetting your game, it works when mine don�t count."
"I agree, it should also show your character dual welding pistols in the lobby menu too."
"That actually would be pretty cool, or if you could see one on each side of you or something."
"I think an interesting thing would be if you could select two different pistols for akimbo. And yes it should show both pistols, also I would like for there to be a way for you to show your melee weapons and launchers because with pistol I�m pretty sure if you equip a shield and then favorite the loadout it shows the equipped pistol (I don�t think it shows both when akimbo is active) but the knife isn�t shown"
But that's too unrealistic /s.
I thought this was a CW thread from how op akimbo is in that game
"Search for ""EOMM""."
None of those missions work rn.
Ok thank you
"I'm having the exact same problem with the same skin. However, when I was doing one of the lerch skin missions a few weeks ago (activate dead silence however many times) it only worked when I did it in warzone. Idk if that's the case for this one too, but I hope not, I'm trash at wz."
What happened to your old account?
I played Warzone on my brothers account for a little. Then when I bought the game I got a new account. I never did anything bad on there
We should learn that at season 2 if we get the new guns or not
I think we will keep getting new updates for the game until they come out with a new call of duty BR that completely kills the hype of this one.
"Warzone is here to stay long term. They aren�t making a new one. This was confined multiple times including recently by the CEO. 

They might (and should tbh) detach it and make it a standalone application. Preferably with the Cold War engine so the operators would look better."
Just defuse the bomb already... People like you are honestly incredibly annoying.
I�ve got enemies shooting at me unfortunately
"Same here lol, that's part of what makes it so fun, is getting a shot off and hitting in a head to head fight. Even better is when it's a trade kill. 

Also been using throwing knives as a backup, just in case I miss at close range. Still die plenty, but it's too much fun for any frustration to last long."
"I�ll be honest: I think the crossbow is dumb. That said, I absolutely cannot help but laugh good-naturedly when another player domes me with it. Like, watching my corpse with a stupid bolt sticking out of its head is always funny. 

The crossbow is the one weapon that I refuse to allow to infuriate me. Good on you, dude."
"I'm kinda with you there LOL. It's not exactly at all competitive, but it's not really meant to be. Always fun watching corpses do a backflip when you get a headshot though."
Reminds me of the crossbow action in far cry
"fuck the crossbow, honestly.  worst weapon in the game."
"That's part of why it's so fun. It's not competitive in the slightest. Makes kicking the arses of tryhards running VALs or SPRs even more satisfying. 

Good tool against shields too when you use explosive bolts."
Pretty sure those are exclusive to Warzone and Cold War.
It's not working in warzone or multi-player my brother
Would you like help in locating your virginity too?

"This. 

Though the challenges showing up is due to a bug, not necessarily indicative of the packs coming soon. This same thing happened with Gaz and in December with Ronin. 

The vault packs have been in the files since August."
*whom* I�ve had equipped
"I thought I've seen others pointing this out recently.  It may be a current issue that hasn't been fixed, but there have also been threads about new missions that won't start until the new season."
My Cold War campaign shits itself when I get to the part where you destroy the plane with the RC-XD so idk how the Cold War campaign is. Either way I liked the modern warfare one because I�ve always thought the modern warfare story was iconic and price is sick
"i loved both campaigns however they were both too short :(

really want a sequel but rumors are that the next cod is a ww2 version"
Just imagine them trying to incorporate a ww2 setting into warzone - no one is going to like that outcome especially if you like the modern setting and the characters
I thought it was in the 1950s not ww2?
"CW plot was amazing, but short. MW plot was good but felt they could�ve more to it. IMO CW had more memorable missions, when with MW I forgot the mission that were �non-important/had little action�"
"Yeah especially compared to COD4 and MW2. In COD4 the intro from the POV of the president, the tanker mission, the heli crash, All ghillies up are so memorable because if the set pieces.  And MW2 was in hindsight a bit too dependent on action and could have used some more restraint but with the Favelas, the Oil Rig and Gulag, DC Burning, Cliffhanger and obv No russian you also have some memorable missions and level designs. MW19 just didn't had enough of that IMO."
[deleted]
I just preferred mw I really liked the characters
"I agree, MW campaign has a better built story with an actual backstory on a new character, and had some really intense missions. I personally love the Embassy mission, it gave me 13 Hour vibes. My only complaint was the final mission, I didnt like the ending at all, it felt too easy. Cold war could have had a great campaign but the missions were too short. And they didnt build a story what so ever. The only interesting thing was the ""bad guy"" ending."
U surprised? it looked like you had been camping there for a while
Actually I had after I found out the roof was a bad idea.
"As much as I admire the throw and the hit, because it's awesome, as much do I have to tell you that this guy has more than just a UAV going on here..."
I tend to be the most unluckiest person on video games hahaha.
Rekt
Camperrrrr
Isn't the objective to survive?
Get good
"I am very confused. People are saying ""camper"" yet I was surviving and doing the objective? If I were to leave I would get killed a lot faster. I don't know why call of duty communities are so toxic that they forget the main objective."
I believe that this is a typo in the description of the perk. I was able to unlock the akimbo perk by using Mo'Money on the Renetti itself.
youre right. confirmed
Just buy the pack wit the akimbo guns already maxed out
Put specialist on!! No need for kill streaks and all the perks really help.
"I never used specialist on my camo grind. I made sure I have radar drone and uav, to help out fellow launcher grinders."
For long shots I recommend ground war it's just so easy to do them with every single weapon
I just cant seem to play good on gw and get many kills
"I wanted to get damascus back in the day, but I didn't play much MW and now I'm hopping back in.

The only thing stopping me from getting damascus is the launchers and LMGs. I literally hate LMGs so much. And launcher challenges are just a joke. Who the heck wants to use a launcher to do anything other than shoot the odd killstreak every now and then?

I've got SMGs and Melee to platinum but that's it. I have 1 gold sniper rifle and like 1 gold AR. So I've barely even started in the grand scheme of things, but idk if I actually want to do it, cause some challenges are just not fun at all."
"Yeah I agree some challenges are just not fun. But lmg are pretty easy and there's only 4 and the requirements are pretty low as well. Like 45 longshots compared to 100 on the ARs. If you are going to do it, good luck."
Welcome to the club my guy! Many congratulations. Its hardwork but frewing whenever you can finally use what you want
Thank you. I do love showing it off lol
"Congrats man! I did my grind a while back, but I remembered the streak kills with the riot shield were the bane of my existence. The easiest way I did it was I would camp the elevators in downtown in ground war and smack whoever came up. I'd only get 2 or 3 streaks a game, but it was better than taking a random stray pellet to my pinky in hardcore when I had 2 out of 3 kills"
"I just did it last night, camping the boiler room on Gun Runner and the upstairs areas on St. Petrograd and jumping out the window every time someone went to cap B. Got 3-5 streaks each game that way"
Rust was king for me. Every chokepoint you could hold with the riot shield
Honestly? Looks pretty cool
Sickest glitch I�ve seen yet
Happens when you lag out/ disconnect in the middle of sliding.
This looks like what happens if you alt tab and lose the ability to run and climb.
I think you broke your neck
Nah your just lagging
This is like CS:GO zoom but in reverse
What platform are you on
pc
Do you have  your headset plugged into the mic jack on your motherboard?
In windows setting for audio make sure you have your microphone as the default communication device. Had the same issue when I connect my Quest 2 and it reset my defaults.
To put it simply the game for me wont go to stage 2 even when i do as it says
Then take SND off? The fuck
Had similar but it was team death match and kill confirmed so I took them out to play other modes.
Yeah man just deselect snd if you don't feel like playing it at the time lol its just random chance
"That was nice clear, I don't really play that mode often but I do enjoy it on shipment"
"It's a blast on shipment literally lol, I've been using the renetti and having some fun!"
"I�m a bit tired with it, but same here since last week update.

From 73 ""rocky"" fps (75Hz monitor) to 63 with dips right now.   
It�s the same to change the res to a higher or lower one. 

In a nuthsel, the performance was going down since S1."
"I haven't seen a performance decrease, but since the last update I'm getting constant Dev Error 6328. This happens moreso when I play Warzone with friends (who are on Xbox, I'm PC) than when I play Warzone solo. This happens almost every single trio match, but only seen it once in 6-7 solo matches.

I've reinstalled Warzone twice (once with only warzone, once with the entire game). Underclocked RAM settings from 3600mhz to 3200mhz. Clean re-installed the Nvidia Driver. Nothing has worked.

I'm on an i9 9900k, 3080 rtx.  


Also, one other odd thing I've noticed. Whenever I click Play in Battle net on the game, the first launch seems to instantly crash. The second launch will then throw the ""Safe Mode"" warning dialog box indicating the game previously crashed."
"I would recommend updating your bios first. It's nowhere near as ""scary"" to do with modern uefi bios as it was before uefi came along. Depending on the manufacturer of your motherboard, it may even have a failsafe (like Asus). 

If you are worried that you may brick your MB and whether or not it's covered by warranty, you could contact your retailer's service desk to make sure your warranty covers failed bios flashing. Make sure to write down the name of the service representative in case anything goes wrong, and ask them if they know for certain if it's covered or, if not, ask them to confirm with one of their colleagues.

Ask them if it's okay to stay on the phone while you go through the flashing process.

I'm on a gaming laptop with an 8th gen i7 hex-core cpu and gtx 1060 6gb gpu when I play Warzone with my friends. Normally I play on PS4.

Even after moving the game to my already limited capacity boot m.2 ssd, the game would get frame drops whenever an enemy got near me. I disabled highlights and I have been playing without issues ever since.

Good luck!"
"I get the same sort of FPS with a Ryzen 9 5900X and a RTX 2080 Super.

Never thought anything of it, just how the game is."
Dang
Dam bro
I'm not getting that much lag
"Really?

Where are you located? I�m in AZ, so I assume I�m NAWest server Cali probably? I�m not far from there so I�m unsure why my ping chills around 210ms 

Every once in a while it�s 38-62ms but I�m rubber banding and teleporting through shit, ghost bullets and recoil from hell."
I�m in the Southeast and I have been lagging all day. I have had one or two matches where it seemed to be stable but a lot of packet loss lag. It was worse around 1 PM eastern but it has continued when I have logged back around 4 then round 6. This is on Xbox One X on a Wired connection.
"Yea my Xbox is hard wired and the network test shows

Been playing in the Midwest without issues this weekend.
Is it specific days? Or just non existent?
Fuckin sick

"I have good internet, and it doesn�t matter who is party leader either!"
All the time
Yup. Happens all the time for me. I won't go one gaming session without it happening at least once.
Its a bug
I haven't been able to buy the Season One Battle Pass as I've joined during Season 2. However Operator Missions for these S1 skins still appear for me. I can't complete them though. Is there any way at all to or are they just there for show?
They�re part of the �season 1 vault pack� bundles that have yet to be released. Once you purchase those then you can complete the missions that are showing up rn. It�s just a visual glitch for the moment
Yeah I tried to do it all day it�s fucked up
Same things happenin on xbox for bales 10 pistol kill and minotaurs 15 lmg
I have the same issue but with another operator.  Activision needs to get it together.
"Some operator skin challenges are showing up for people even when they don�t own the challenges, if you are 100% sure that you own the challenges then I�m not sure

"I�ve been getting that too yeah, sometimes I get that sometimes I get like 10% packet loss and 300 ping for the start of the match then it sorts itself out"
"Since this week (and some periods before)  ive noticed some lag which has been frustrating, it happens if my latency is 30ms or even 80+ms.  
Half a second delay between me shooting a dude then him dying, or just seeing the guy who shot me appear out of air only after he killed me.  
Reminds me of when i played mw2 on my super shitty internet years ago, wouldnt think id relive this on my gigabyte cable'd internet."
This is the norm since august-september
"I�ve only just started getting it, was playing MW over Cold War and it�s been fine for me, just started getting bad this last week or so"
"Not sure why they would even make that a thing, you have to separately purchase MW in order to play it."
the M82 is just the Rytech writing around trademarks
"I looked into it and the Rytec isn�t the M82, it�s the XM-109."
"Personally I'd like to see a proper AR-10 rifle like the SR-25 or RSASS, the Five-SeveN and the AK-12"
"Yeah definitely. However, I thought the AK-12 could be made by converting the AK-47 and with the Steel Curtain blueprint?"
"Funny, when I hear ""proper AR-10,"" I think of [this thing](https://i.imgur.com/2KSohs7.jpg)"
"This was the aspect of cod ghosts I liked. Using guns we haven't seen in the series, something like that would be refreshing rather than seeing the m4 and ak-47 for the hundredth time."
"Well, that can be done. Most of the guns on the list haven�t been in a COD game other than the obvious ones."
ACR!
ACR isn't made anymore :(
This would be perfect since it was introduced in the OG MW2.
This cod has had way more than any other. I'm perfectly fine with the selection this game.
"I�m just saying, next MW when they have new guns I�m hoping they�re new at not renewed."
They should've put the kolibri or the fp 45 liberator for the memes
"Those guns are way too old, practically antiques. Which is why I propose they instead put the gun that single handedly bankrupted and entire company, the Zip .22. It�s incredibly bad and jams almost every second bullet, so it�d be incredibly useless."
They should put the type 95
I would rather have them be able to add all weapons to the game. Not just �modern� weapons. Can�t just keep it with weird limits of only modern. Let�s go and add old weapons we don�t see anymore
"That�s what I said. I don�t mind the odd addition, I just wish there were more notable ones."
Thats just bs
You're fucked
"sweet


thanks tho"
I like how part of the forward assist is just vibing normally during this
*Now entering THE MATRIX*
*screams in terror*
So that error is because the GPU is overheating?
not necessary... my bocw often crashes but only in fireteam dirtybomb or zombies. my fancurve is set so that my rx6800xt doesnt get hotter then like 70-75c. so at least for me the temps are not the problem
"So I was basically unable to play yesterday with my friends cause of this crash returning. My battle.net app got an update a few days ago around the time I noticed this crash more often. Closed the app entirely after launching warzone and now it�s not crashing. Played 3 of the battle royal training modes in a row. Open up the app again, within seconds the game crashed as the plane was flying in. The new launcher is making the game unstable. Worth a shot for you all, hope it helps."
I'll try this suggestion. Thanks.
"Switch to your secondary and back to your primary. i believe that worked for me at least, the few times it happened. If not, getting killed should respawn you with the weapon in hand.

It actually happened in the last match I was playing with my bae as well, to her at least, but it was on shipment so she got spawnkilled before she could react."
"I did switch to secondary, but can�t switch back. I killed my self over and over to see if spawning in different areas would affect it and still no gun :/ Day 3 of this"

"Are these challenges for skins from previous seasons? If they are, you need to have the base skin from those battle passes in order to be able to complete them."
Just the normal daily challenges on multi playwr
"Shipment is awful for 6v6. Very good on 2v2 or 3v3 though 

Shoothouse is the best small 6v6 map. So damn good with a lot of replayability and depth to it. The verticality helps a lot"
Yep
"Dome. It flowed super well in mw3. Chaotic, but not so chaotic it feels like masochism. 


Tied. With strikezone."
"I was gonna say lol, strikezone was awesome. Basically a refined Dome 

I do prefer Ghosts to MW3 though so that influences it a bit"
Shipment is literally the OG and Shoothouse
Killhouse is underrated af
Nuketown by far. Especially the Bo2 version
"From all the maps I played, Shipment MW2019 is my favourite small map. Back in black ops 1 and 2 I really liked nuketown. Don't care much for the bo3 version and I haven't played bo4. I only played the cw holiday version during the free week, but it looked rather dull even with the xmas lights"
Nuketown is the best prove me wrong
[deleted]
"Whoops, you forgot speedball"
"�A dead silence perk that isn�t 100% silent, with a field upgrade that makes it 100% silent 

I personally love this idea, it�ll satisfy the people that wanted dead silence to return as a perk without it being OP and a crutch perk. If you ask me, having enemies that you can�t hear at all just ruins the competitiveness"
Its how it was in mw1 iirc
"LET ME CARRY A PISTOL AS A PRIMARY
And add the g18 back
AND FOR GODS SAKE NERF THE MP5"
"Yes I ran revenge in mw3. 



Yes. I know Im the only one who did."
"With support streaks, do you mean them replacing killstreaks in general or having to choose between the two? I feel like having an option between the two would be much better. Also, only nerfing the ADS on the VAL? Damage and range nerf please, or recoil nerf"
"1. I mean like mw3 where you choose between the two, and both have certain streaks they either share (UAVs, C-UAVs), or exclusively have.


2. The last part of the nerfs were exclusive to the kar98k cause thats all it needs. The SPR needs a damage nerf, an ads nerf, and a mobility nerf. The AS VAL needs so much fucking fixing."
"Do you think they will make people redo camos for guns in current MW, or add a bunch of new weapons that aren�t currently in MW on top of those?

Just asking because continuity and Warzone integration..."
"I mean it presumably a whole new game, not some DLC so why wouldn�t you?"
"I really like shoot house but aside from that there aren't any original maps from this game that I would really like to see return. I like the addition of old fan favorite maps, but we really need new maps.."
Gun runner and hackney yard are really good tho
"I keep saying it, stonehaven would be awesome as a ground war map. Also speaking of ghosts I'd love if they brought the ghosts operators as characters, maybe even implement them in the story as a black ops squad that ghost and mace were in (hence their masks)"
"The dead silence Perk should include silencing opening doors, also the permanent shoot house should also include a replacement for shipment like another popular fast paced map? Rust maybe?! I do love rust but idk I love shipment so I would�ve wanted that to return in it�s own way, or maybe modern warfare gets its own version of nuke town such as the one in warzone?! But outside In like an open film studio."
"> A dead silence perk that isn�t 100% silent, with a field upgrade that makes it 100% silent.

> A perk to make door opening quiet
 
Just bring back ninja perk and add sitrep pro to counter it. Problem solved."
"Nah, we need NEW maps"
"THIS, I dont mind a few returning maps(I personally would love to see a Modern Version of Terminal and Hardhat) but dont have fucking 70% of the game's map pool to be some recycled content"
Well duh. That�s obviously gonna happen.
Do you play cold war?
yeah I got to level 129 in Cold War
"Buy the battlepass for 1000 cp, complete battlepass and earn 1300 cp, you now have 2550 cp and can buy what you want"
Level the battle pass all the way up and it gives you more cod points than what you spend on it.
"The season pass is only useful for warzone and cold war, cod points and xp tokens if you ask me. I'm not gonna tell you what to do with your points, but if I had that point ballance, I would hang on to it, wait for season 2 and earn the free points until I had 2400 and buy an operator bundle I have been eyeing"
Get the battle pass and some g fuel bruddah
it costs like 30 bucks to ship coke to Australia not worth it
You dont need weapon packs to kill tryhards though
all I need is the invisible skill but its invisible
"Its game servers, i have same issue, game looking for <120 ping (60 ping my averague), poor hit detection, lagging, getting stuck in the same lobby"
"oh ok, thank you"
has your game been freezing for a few seconds aswell?
"It's server side. My theory is they moved servers from mw to cw (I'm not sure how it works), thus leaving mw with less server and so lower capacuty"
"ohhhh, gotchya thanks"
"Don't buy digital, if you go to a used game store, you can find all of the mediocre activision titles for an actually fair price. This is why I will never buy a ""digital only"" console.

Of course, I don't know if you can actually find a hard copy for the PC... I hope so. I'm not sure how the blizzard launcher relation works in regard to disks."
"Sadly there are no physical copies of MW2019 for PC. Ever since Steam really blew up, most people stopped buying physical media and it's pretty much been a decade since it was normal to still build a PC with an optical drive."
"1. Because it's 1.5 years old, it's not exactly a 10 year old game
2. Activision have kept most of their games full price since the dawn of time, even 5 year old CoD games are still full price iirc"
[deleted]
Because you will pay it
g2a.com has cheap games
Because activision wants to milk their games for as long as possible. Black ops 3 is still full price and its more then old enough to be discounted
Consider it the newest cod since no one plays cold war..
Why switch to pc to only play Modern Warfare? There�s a plethora of better games that have been out longer that are superior especially on pc with Modern Warfare servers being as shit as they are
"It�s not *only* for MW. The move is primarily for Warzone, but I�d like to have MW as well.

But yeah, I�ll be playing a lot of other games too. Any games you�d want to recommend?"
"Why do you think? It's not a multibillion industry because they're churning out equal value.

Welcome to digital merchandise and capitalism.

I bought Planetside2 via who ever the original publisher was and when it changed over to the current publisher my account magically disappeared. If you don't hold something in your hand that is useable you don't own shit."
"They don't want players buying older games, so they keep the price artificially high relative to the actual value. Same reason they always discount the latest title significantly in the first couple months after release."
"The one thing I noticed is the price of the game in stores has stayed consistently high. Usually brick and mortar stores drop the older game from 60 to 50 or 40 when the new game comes out and as it ages it goes down from there until they stop selling it. 

The only thing I can guess is that people are still buying it at full price so there is no incentive to lower the price, hence why gta v stayed such a high price for so long."
"Because Activision is a greedy, scummy corporation, that's why.

Check Kinguin, it's only around $50 usd there."
Because MW is the best COD ever
That's debatable
"It�s great but I wouldn�t call it the best. I would rank MW, MW2, and BLOPS1 higher. However, it�s the best title in years that�s for sure"
"You sure you�re not humble-bragging? 

�I only have an above average K/D and usually drop more kills than most people and consistently place in the top 25% of the lobby�"
"I am not and I don�t think what I do is good either. Maybe because I watch people like ImMarksman or Futives and they drop 15 or more kills easy with any gun, map, or game. You know why? Because they got SnD knowledge that I�m struggling with. I once played with Marksman and I was on top of the leaderboard and he was second. I�m not saying I�m better than him because I�m definitely not but it felt good to be right with him where I thought he would just carry me. He did say �Good game Slasher� in the stream and I can�t forget that. Again, I�m not good, but I want to be as good as these guys!"
"Depends on play style. If you want to drop consistent 20 bombs. Then you have to learn to play like someone like Futives. Stim rush with a SMG/melee class, improve reaction time/aim, abuse movement mechanics like slide cancel into ads/b hopping, use meta weapons. But this would require you to become a full time sweat lord, which I don�t see the appeal of. Map knowledge is vital as well. Know the camping spots, line of sights, and rush routes, and you can dominate a match."
"I want to be as good as them because I want to start a YouTube Channel. ImMarksman once said on stream that no one is going to watch someone �Average� and that�s why I want to get good at it. Search is the only game mode I play in CoDs beside FFA but FFA is bad in this game because camp ahhhh. 

If I started uploading of the games that I have currently nobody would watch them because they are too average, nothing exciting watching someone drop 10 kills in one game. I wouldn�t watch that."
"Bro just don�t be dog water! Get GOOD! The following are MUSTS: 1)Gfuel..nonstop IV of Gfuel. 2) Rose skin, if you don�t have it you�re screwed and you might as well quit CoD and go play roblox. 3) get a killer gaming chair and a stand up microphone. 4) LED lights! This one should be obvious. 5) only use lit lingo like �cracked, dog water, bots, sweats, 1 shot 1 shot 1shot!, he�s selfing, and always say �he�s stream sniping� after you die.

If you can get all that you�ll be living in a million dollar home that 14 year olds paid for with their parents money homie!"
"I mean, I don�t even stream so �he stream sniped� won�t work for me and I�m not into RGB either. I work a regular job and pay for everything myself so that�s that. Instead of GFuel, I drink 3 cups of coffee when I�m home so that works perfectly for me. Don�t have any gaming gear beside PS4 and not so good i7 7770 and GTX 1060 but that�s what I could afford so..."
Just get good
But how? What can I do more to get better is my question!
"Do you want to get better at the game or just catch your best gameplay that day? YT Search players will give you 2 games worth of a video of their best gameplays... Meaning, maybe record thru out a game session and check what can be viewer worthy. I�m not always looking for high kill SnD games but routes people are running, anyone catching Aces, 1v6 moments. I enjoy SnD content from anyone if they have a different approach from mine. I play mainly HC Search and get 20 bombs here n there but that�s cause I�m an aggressive player, doesn�t mean much people can learn or enjoy from it. Hopefully this gives u a different approach"
"I�m looking to get better in general. It�s not about recording one game that i played for 8 hours. I want to have good games throughout the time I play the game. 


The Youtubers I follow, ImMarksman and Futives, they do Livestreams and they get good games throughout the stream with some low kill games.

I want to be good like that, consistency can only be achieved by knowledge that I�m probably missing. Need to learn positioning, when to move and when to rotate. How to stay behind cover, when to push. I need to learn all of this and don�t know where to find this information. I have seen some videos by Rambo teaching how to play Search but that wasn�t really any help since I knew everything he said in that video!"
"There�s a bug that�s showing older battlepass challenges. It�s visual, trying to complete them won�t unlock them."
People buy the packs for a reason. So U can see the skins so I don�t see it changing
Your skin would still be there. It�s just for the other players in the game. Also I think it would be cool to be the only captain price on the map
"Don't forget the extreme realism of the cat ear skin, or the gold suit skin, or, my least favorite, the halloween skins."
"Yeah, it�s dumb. They promised they wouldn�t add stuff like this. I�m fine with it in warzone and core, but it shouldn�t be in a mode where it�s supposed to be more realistic and you can team kill"
Have you tried to just do it pretending as if it said renetti or does it not make progress
Use the renetti. Its just a typo. This is posted about at least 3-5 times a day.
Oh damn.  I bought the 1776 pack for the M4 and renetti.  Didn't know that t was that hard to get akimbo lol. Lucky me
"Is the Skyvov not an attachment?, I thought it was. Not sure if something changed but when I did the Alimbo for the Renetti I remember not taking that long despite the requirements. I also recommend playing hardcore mode. Hope you can get it good luck"
The problem is that some skin challenges are popping up when u are not supposed to have them. So they just stay there unable to progress them
Bummer
"""With a shotgun"" could have done what with almost any other weapon."
Do people not know that they can record gameplay on their console? This looks like something out of 2009.
daaammmmmmnnnnn. who is faze testy? who is faze Nio? who is Faze dirty???????
I hope reinforce comes back. I had a lot of fun with it last week.
I never played it
"It's Activision, they are purposely slowing down the game to get people to buy Cold War"
no one else in my party is experiencing the lag at all and I have the most powerful PC setup out of all of us
Proof?

"Jak�s best use is spamming on shipment, I like it but it�s not a viable gun.  With the 32 round mag, aimlessly walking around killing people within 5 feet is fun, but beyond that, i get too many hitmarkers.  Try putting on the dragons breath rounds, gives a little more range but you only got 8 shots."
"Thanks for the response, I�ll surely be saving it for shipment as well. 

I�ll have to admit to though, when I noticed it under the shotguns tab I got a rush of euphoria, mainly from my love of the AA-12 from MW2 and the USAS from Battlefield."
It�s good as a secondary. You just have to use the longest barrel for the best range.
It�s an amazing shotgun if setup correctly.  You can reach all the way across shipment and take someone out with or without dragon�s breath.  The 32 round drum slows you down or you have limited rounds.  Like most shotguns you need a good secondary for long range but it can be a beast.
"Welcome to the club king, and congratulations."
"I have everything except the shield, knife and launchers. I can�t get myself to do the shield. Too frustrating"
Hardcore shipment makes it easier
Good shit man
I just finished mine this morning after I got off work. Congrats!
I stopped years ago bc I was scared of the shield
Hardcore shipment
Congrats
this map is so shit and so lazy. i hate it with a passion. if it comes up i just leave.
Agreed. Such a waste of time to even enter the lobby. You won�t have fun.. don�t bother.
"I used to hate it but I kinda like it now. The trick is to use as many little jumps and flank spots as you can. Like there's loads of spots to peak over the fence and stuff 

It doesn't feel like a GW map though. I don't like how little variety there is"
I don�t do poorly on it. But if your team holds back and expects a carry you get RAILED. The consequences of camping are soo high for the team.
Shrapnel and a trophy system are my go to. Throw double flashes and grenades while my trophy stops them.
To-Fucking-Tally
this map sucks ass but there's ways to spawn trap the enemy very quickly and rack up lots of kills. esp if you start on the E flag side
Only if your team understands pressure.
-10hp to desk kun
Fr tho. One of these days I�m gonna catch my mouse or keyboard and fuck them up

The AMAX got a range nerf with the grau nerf which was like in season 4
"Really, but it was in multiplayer or warzone?"
"Nah the VAL hasn't changed. Still shreds and still OP. They haven't mentioned changing it. So if they're slow with future updates like they are now, we might not see a nerf for quite some time. Not that it matters. There will always be a new meta to complain about. The MP5 and 725 have been nerfed to hell and are still in the upper to top tier of the meta. Its just how the guns are designed in regards to ADS, fire rate, and damage multipliers when targeting specific body parts."
"Val doesnt need a nerf, mp5 is still better than it."
"wrong. As Val is completely busted, almost the same mobility as MP5, shoots faster, has the damage of some big LMG, normal AR range, easy vertical recoil.... It's just easy mode, it's a gun that will carry the player. The MP5 simply has good killing potential (if your aim is flawless), but it's actually balanced against other gun choices (like AUG, M4 or RAM)"
"Lol. May be in point blank range, or if you and your enemy are both tac sprinting. In every other situation as val is superior to almost any gun."
"You missed out the AK47 too, been replaced by updated models countless times 

I think the newest ones are the AK12 and AK15

Oh and the Kar

Hell I don�t think the MP5 sees much service any more, as iconic as it is"
"Some of the guns I didn�t bring up is because they�re explained away in campaign. We can see Al-Qatala and Farrah�s Freedom Fighters using the AK-47, Kar-98K, and presumably the .725."
Or just let them use all weapons and not put weird limits on guns.
"I would just be happy is the gunfights weren�t complete ass. I can�t even play this game anymore, its so frustrating."
Next modern warfare is basically COD 4
It�s a game not some hardcore military simulator.
You cant even name your loadout �uzi� because this game is perfect and has no bugs at all!
I prefer UwUzi
"It's okay, I just use the alternate spelling ""Oozie"""
"I just called my loadout ""UZI"" without problem ..."
"Lmao, the funny thing is you can have a display name ""demoniccumfart69"""
"you see my name. on mw I have to use an @ for the last A, bc they think I'm saying the naughty ASS word lol."
I love how I can�t put the word �gun� in my clan tag - In a game thats literally about guns lmao
"Tries to name my loadout with the Stoner as ""Stoner"".  PrOfAnItY."
"Can't even have boof as a clan tag anymore although they have two marijuana packs. If your tag is boof, dont change it. My brother and I had it, he changed it, and now he can't change it back. I didn't change mine"
No why would buying it on pc grant you the game for free on ps5?!
"Because it�s the same account, I linked my account, so if it�s the same account it should have my games, shouldn�t it? Plus, buying black ops Cold War on pc granted it for free on my ps5, so why didn�t the same apply for modern warfare?"
"There�s a separate icon/launch for all three games. Try to find the modern warfare one. I don�t use battle.net, so I can�t speak to that part."
"Yeah, there are the three icons on my ps5. Warzone says play, Cold War says to select multiplayer, campaign or zombies and mw says �purchase� but I already had the game on pc and I am using the same account that I used on pc. Why did my black ops Cold War  carry over from my pc to ps5 but my modern warfare didn�t?"
Ew.
"Everybody knows that : u use Gas in shipment as last solution on toxic people. Its like ""you shit on my game, i shit back on yours"" untill the whole map goes green and everyone coughing."
Satan is a fan of your work.
"Well, it's all fun and games on Shipment, until it goes completely green. Here's the remedy - two players on your team with trophy system and the gas quickly settles. And nades, RPG's and other sharp flying objects altogether. Even your CM disappears. Rage quitting commencing in 3....2....1... Magic!"
"I've been seeing a lot more people equip the trophy system on shipment, it's very useful. But, yeah, sometimes it becomes stun/flash/gas grenade fest, I'll still play though, lol."
"Gas grenades are nearly worthless.  I have run them since the start, but as a single fire player, i just fuck myself up.  It is the same with  the poison crossbow.  It makes it so you cannot reload by surviving enemy can ADS melt the shit out of you."
They are worthless depending on game mode and map you are on. On Shipment they are effective. Just like stun grenades and flash grenades can be too.
Bot.
The 32 rnd mags conversion kit was added later but the gun was part of the base game
Oh so it looks like I�ll have to grind gold for it then. Getting the longshots for that thing is just mad tiring =�) Any tips for longshots bro?
"The uzi was a launch gun so yes you do need to get gold for it. The dlc smgs are the striker, fennec and iso"
"Funny thing was, I already have gold for my Fennec shortly after it was launched, before I knew about all these base game and DLC stuffs. 

Anyway, thanks a lot man!"
The Uzi is pretty mediocre. But the .42 round conversion kit makes it one of the best guns in the game. Good luck with the grind!
I have yet to unlock the conversion rounds but I�ll be sure to use it once I have it unlocked. Thanks a lot man!
"It�s very good in hardcore, set it up for hip fire and it�s a beast. Longshots and mounted are easy to knock down with a longshot build staring down mid"
Yeah man I just got done with the hip fire kills on shipment just now and had just unlocked the conversion kit. I�m also halfway done with the longshots and mounted kills.
"DLC guns: 

-Ars: Ram7, Grau, Amax, An 97, As Val

-Smgs: Striker 45, Fennec, Iso

-Sg: Vkl,  Jak 12

-Lmgs: Mk9 Bruen, Finn

-Mrs: Sks, Crossbow, Spr

-Sr: Rytec

-Pistols: Renneti

-Meele: Sticks, Kodochis"
Holger lmg
"Alright thanks a lot mate!

The thing is, I�ve already unlocked platinum for all the assault rifles including the DLC ones lol, because that was the only grinding that I�ve done before deciding to go for Damascus. 

But still, thanks for the info though!"
"This will help with the Damascus grind https://damascus.now.sh

For the SMG�s I used the lower doorway in front of the wall (by flag C) to mount and get my long shots.  As for setup, everything that increased range and aiming stability, (I unlocked the longest range barrel in the process) and either a canted hybrid or 4 time flip scope."
"Alright thanks a lot mate!

I still have a few longshots and mounted kills left and then I can focus on the other categories."
"Shit, I�m bout to pay someone to get my shield and launchers gold. I don�t have enough time to do them and only get to play a couple hours a week. I have platinum AR, SMG, snipers and marksmen."
"I�m also feeling quite burnt out lately after grinding too much. Just got gold on my model 680 and Origin is the only one left before I got platinum on my shotguns. I only have the pistols, launchers and melees (knife and shield) left but I absolutely have no drive to grind the Origin atm anymore lol. 

But that�s quite a lot you�ve done there mate. I might just give it a rest for a few days then get back on the grind again.

Best of luck to you mate!"
I've had that issue a lot. Ever since I turned off cross platform in the fall. It will do that less frequently. This other issue is constant. Actually I feel they're punishing ps4 players for not wanting to be stuck in hackzone with PC. I never connect right away. It will do a load attempt for consistantly 35 second then they produce a pop up saying turn on cross play because they can't find a ps4 lobby. It will do that a couple more times then load a lobby or sit there til they time me out and make me restart the app. Honestly just been playing zombies for last few weeks.
"Yeah, I never have cross play turned on, no matter what I�m playing. The problem I�m having is that it won�t even connect to select a game mode, so I can�t even choose to play warzone or multiplayer"
Hmmm I'm south east coast USA it connected. Same cross play bs tho.
I�m in UAE. Same thing has now happened to my BF�s PS5 which is so strange.
"Ive had that today and the negative 345 blazing gator error on cold war this morning.  I couldnt play either game for like 5 hours.  I reset my internet, clearned cache on ps4 and nothing worked.  I just got on randomly recently."
This gives me some Red vs Blue vibes
Wow your not very good with that thing are you
The mid 2000s when machinima made good videos
Replay Mode is the best YouTube channel. They�re incredibly underrated
How do you use replay mode?
like holy shit theyre heavily underrated. i mean quality video like these got overshadowed by compilations channels
"Idk, this wasn�t funny at all"
Here's the full [video](https://youtu.be/yy7hyaQ6QuE)
Okay this shit is gold
How do i find the replay mode?

You dont need stability lol. The sniper scopes in this game dont sway too badly
"I miss this kinda thing. Reminds me of red vs blue.
Good ol days"
Never realised how smooth the animations in this game look
Shits all over cold war.
Replay Mode is great. They deserve more subs.
"ikr, they produce high quality content despite having only 2k subs."
I love this channel
Gotta do the 360 to make it work lol
Getting some Red vs Blue vibes
This reminds me of rvb
"I haven�t seen a machinima in years, really brought be back"
I saw this video when it can out
"I could have used this earlier, I just spent ages trying to unlock the rytec amr"
"Cucks hardscope.

Chads hipscope."
If he was using the SPR or Kar98k all those shots would've hit regardless how far away his target was
"Thanks, time to practice QScope."
Haha that was pretty good.
This brings back memories of those battlefield 2 pwned life videos
Or or the Battlefield 2 'Mine' videos.
"Enemy be like ""come on bro you got this"""

Reminded me of Red Vs Blue
Those kinda people wont last in battlefield.
This is giving me strong Red Vs Blue vibes and I love it
"crap.

aw shit.

i just spit coffee all over my keyboard.

now i have to clean it up."
This is awesome
"I�m Mr Meeseeks, quick scope me! Ah don�t give give up Jerry. Just aim down your sights really quick and pull the trigger right when the hit box closes on the center!

Jerry please just hard scope! I can�t take it anymore! I just want to die! I�m Mr Meeseeks please shoot me!!"
Meh . this peak perfection . Means your getting trolled
Why would you wear multi cam arid if you�re going to put on black armor??
"A lot of creators that copy red vs blue machinima fall on their face, and I cringe;  this is actually well done, and funny!"

Where is my Boy Crossbow? And MK2?
How did you get the xbox thing next to your name?
I�m not actually sure but I got 2 free bundles yesterday.
Maybe they're on random rotation for each player then? If I'm not mistaken I have a charm from a free pack that came out before i started playing
"I�ve been playing since the start of Season 2 in MW and I only got this free bundle maybe about a month ago or so. I think you get it at random, cause I saw guys with this bundle months before I finally got it, I assumed they were people who started playing MW from the very beginning."

I play mw for multiplayer but Cold War for zombies
"exactly, right after finishing dark matter ultra i only play zombies"
I play both but MW2019 is just a better game than Cold War. Cold War multiplayer feels like I'm playing a 360 game.
I second this
"After playin the beta, I don�t see how anyone in their right mind would play CW."
"Got CW for free with my GPU. Not a fan. It did make me pick up MW again though, as I had stopped at end of season 1 to focus on university. 

I also now remember why I stopped, and why I should probably do that again."
I don�t really want to spend more money on CW when MW seems like the much more polished game.
I played the CW open beta for 1 hour and uninstalled it. I had absolutely no interest in the game.
"i have tried cold war on the free week, but didn't like it

the option you didn't include"
I very rarely jump on black ops. I don't hate it as bad as some but still definitely not very good.
"i could tell from the beta the game was not for me. couple that with the fact treyarch had to come in and save the day i knew it was going to be a shit fest. and frankly i fucking hate treyarch games. they are so garbage, the sound the netcode its all shit."
"I have no interest in CW because it is in the cold war. I prefer futuristic and modern games. Not the boring ww2 and cold war stuff. My opinion, dont get mad lol"
Play both. Zombies is incredible in cw. Mp is average i would say. Spec ops is ass in mw but mp is decent. So I guess like 50/59
"I don't even know tbh. I only really play Ground War and lately it's just terrible. 

The enemy team is either pushing like crazy, mowing down your team while your teammates blow up their own vehicles for challenges, you try to make a flank play but one of your squad mates spawns on you without a silencer or ghost and you get sniped by someone lying on a roof in spawn 400m away."
I tried out CW but it wasn�t for me. MW just feels way more polished. My biggest issue with MW is the maps but everything else is fantastic
"Didn't like the maps or guns in cold war. Played the alpha and beta and did well, but just didn't enjoy it. MW isn't perfect but I prefer it to CW."
"A fifth option should have been added going like ""Because it looks stunning and plays amazingly well,but Activision wants us to hate it by not giving us what we want."""
"I have not played the new one since launch.  I have tried a few times, but I am not sitting through that stupid video I have already seen.  Fuck that shit.  I tried starting it up tuesday but deleted the fucking game as soon as that video started."
Honestly I barely play either anymore. I just bought Stars Wars Battlefront 2 for $14 in December so I've been grinding for gold for all of the classes and heros/villains in that game. MW 2019 is one of my top three CODs of all time but I just can't play it that much anymore without an FOV slider. I'm really hoping that they will add an FOV slider for console. I enjoy the 120 FPS gameplay on my Series X though. BOCW is alright but I don't enjoy the MP that much. I really enjoyed the zombies but eventually got bored of it.
"theme of MW is so much better, dont care for the weird cold war crap"
Yes
Played both then got the series x and now cw crashes every time I open it
"I have both, MW feels so much better. Cw is rushed, we know that for a fact and it feels like it. Jumping between the 2,the weapons feel incredible on MW, while on CW they fell like nerf guns"
Because it's the best cod since BO2.  I'm not giving it up just because Activision wants me to.  Fuck them
COD 2021 will be made by Sledgehammer Games
"I�d play a ww2 game if it was on the mw2019 engine. 

but I also didn�t play cod from ghosts-mw2019 era, so if you played ww2 a few years back I can understand being tired of it. 

What makes mw2019 for me is the engine, there�s no going back for me, which is why I haven�t bought Cold War."
"I like modern warfare, future sucks, past is just not my preference, I�ll wait for the next modern day one."
Yeah please no outdated historical BS just want a new modern shooter with better and newer weapons.
Well future warfare bombed so u they can�t go past present day really so only way is back
"I�m a modern warfare player, hated Cold War, I�ve also been a cod player since the beginning. If they do it right, have good maps, and sledgehammer can avoid the issues they had with the launch of ww2 (content drought and poor map selection) I have absolutely no issue going back in time and playing a cod game that gets back to its roots."
"I was a core CS:GO fan before,  a sometime Halo and Fortnite player too.  I had played the old COD but found it frustrating, now knowing I was playing on a bad platform that colored my opinion.  Anyway MW 2019 had great buzz on the gun play and upgrades in the movement, realism so I started with MW4 (meh) until it was out then switched over. I really like the game and overall the community (yea the sweats, hackers and screaming kidz) and how those who like MW 2019 over CW have kept it going.  I'm willing to give any MW2021 or 2022 the benefit of the doubt and try it out.  I played CW 2 to 3 times when it was  F2P weeks and still never liked the feel, too arcade like for me.  

Now that they've blended  CW, WZ and MW via WZ I'd think it'd be awkward having WW II guns along side modern weaps that can shred at medium and long range.  IRL weapon technology improves fire rates, hip fire accuracy, velocity, impact, gun handling, reload speed, field ability (dirty conditions).  Playing WZ with a M1 Garand or a Thompson .45 machine gun vs.  AK-47, Mac-10, etc.  not really gonna work I feel.  Thoughts?"
Only hope it is MW2 remake. Best cod ever. But today's kids would not handle it.
"I bought the MW2 remastered to help me get a feel for the franchise game history.  I enjoy  playing the Campaign, even being different in some ways."
Wonder how that will go adding ww2 weapons in to warzone
If they make realistic WW II guns they won't keep up in WZ.
Nah needs to be MWR2 or Warzone for another year without bullshit Cold War guns.
Same problem. Wasted about 2 hours worth of weapon xp just to find out it�s not leveling up anymore.
I played survival on Friday and the CX9 and Sykov were appearing as level 1 at that gunsmith and not leveling up.
XP has been broken for guns and levels recently last update seemed to fix the guns XP. I grinding again but whose to say?
It was working until Thursday for me - yesterday it was not working anymore :(
Yes as of now it has stopped leveling up.  Cant complete the akimbo for the sykov pistol either if anyone has any info on that challenge.  Does anyone know when these guns will become available in warzone
"Prob on Wednesday, when season 2 starts - then it will be available for leveling up again"
"Mounting could return, but without mounting challenges, please!

I want destructible scenarios + Map voting + at least 10 6v6 maps at launch"
"Oh, mounting is an awesome convinience to have, but no mounting challenges"
"The maps were imo the weakest part of mw19, so I agree in them putting more focus on that this time around"
"Mounting challenges + deportable cover = not so bad

Edit: public school education"
This
Agreed
"Mounting will never have a place if they do not increase both flinch and recoil.  I have over 5000 kills with both the FAL and the lever action.  I looked at the mount kills.   5 on the lever action.  15 on the fal.   I mount for less than 0.1% of my kills for those two weapons.   I have no reason to do it.  Lever action would only benefit for long distance, but it is shit at long distance.  So is the fal."
"I'd like more spec ops, but better. I think it could be a really cool game mode maybe with some division2 inspiration but with story and challenge based unlocks"
"I like the idea of missions in verdansk and having a semi open playspace for your playstyle. But for the love of God fix the spawning system, I can't play spec ops just because of the shitshow of enemies that come from everywhere. I run out of ammo and look as fast as I can for ammo crates while avoiding the grenades and rpg spam with a juggernaut pinning me down with gunfire. It's just a piece of shit spawning in an otherwise fun game mode I wished I could play."
I would like them to take advantage of the new consoles' power and create a War type mode from ww2 in ground war
WW2 in ground war = Rush  in Battlefield
I'm gonna be really unhappy if they increase the time to kill. That is one of the reasons I despise CW multiplayer
"It is so satisfying gunning down multiple enemies with ease with how low the ttk is in this game, but it has its cons. I really like high and low ttk it just depends on weapon balancing from there."
"I wouldn't mind if MW had CWs ttk. The thing with CW is that it plays like ass compared to MW, the sound and hit detection all feel so weak. I just couldn't get into it after playing MW"
dink
Boink
"Imagine, playing HC with a pistol, something to really brag about."
This wasn't hardcore though..it was regular core play.
U will be able to use the operator but only they skin and not the base skin
[deleted]
"You can use this skin, but you can't use base skin and you can't use it in mw multiplayer"
Basicly I suck at surviving Warzone however Warzone Rumble gives me the Chance to make my challenges easier and now its gone.....
Is it actually snipers only or are u let�s people use marksman
Well there is a custom mode on the custom matches that we will likely be using. But I am not against the Kar98k but will be a discussion with participants
Damned be all kar players
I love using it. Right now though I'm trying to get some ranks on the HDR that thing is a monster!
"Same, couldn't even complete get 15 kills with an AR."
I heard it's a visual bug and it can't be completed
"You can�t complete it because they�re for vault packs and you have to buy them first. Their bugged in that they�re showing, not that they can�t be completed."
Thanks!

"Damn, u were at 26 so close"
You must top it for the culture
Are you expecting a milsim or what?
"Quickscoping is fine as a mechanic. The problem in this game is that the marksman rifles have no flinch at all, rarely hit marker unless you seriously fuck up, and have aim assist on console. 

Getting the Kar, Mk2, and SPR gold for my damascus was pitifully easy on shipment. It�s really just point and click."
Where do you find these absolute Noobs to play against?
I played in the morning and that's when noobs play mostly plus I played stir-crazy and I think SBMM is toned down there.
idk he must of gotten lucky because surely he couldn�t of reverse boosted:/ he said so in the title
"I got a nuke on Superstore in a game of domination. Had no intention of going for one but after i earned the third killstreak which put me near halfway, I kept playing carefully. 
Kept picking up ANY weapon I could find and use it lol. I didn't have the likes of scav on. 
I got the nuke and flicked the swtich literally at the very end of the game. The game time paused for it."
"Nice bro. I wasn't even thinking about how many kills I have and was just going in rushing and picking up weapons, I think if I started playing more carefully like you did I would've choked it."
"Curiously i got my first nuke in Superstore, i was runing specialist, its very helpful once you go the specialist"
"Congratulations I stayed 4 kills from my nuke in shipment, my own munition box exploded me... :'("
"Thanks man. Try playing stir-crazy, the spawns mess up because some maps are too small for 10v10 so you can use that to your advantage."
"I've only ever went for a nuke a few times on MW, I remember on shipment hc I was on a 25 then this guy crept up behind be with a 725 and shot me. 

Didn't try go for one again."
F
I was 2 kills away from my nuke and got crossmapped by a crossbow
That sucks ass.
I find your lack of camping disturbing.
Yeah usually people would freak out and at least slow down a bit because of the high kill streak

Do u have all the other weapons done? Like shotguns ars smgs?
"As for Damascus, not yet. But i have a few AR, SMG, pistols and knife that are gold."
"It's a cold war/warzone battlepass, your items will be there"
Wow how I could I miss this. That�s beyond bs
U hit the shoulder
Really? Shouldn�t it still be one shot still tho coz I have FMJ on and the sniper itself has amazing damage
"You hit him like Zakhaev, he ain't goin' down from a shoulder shot!"
"With snipers there's aim sway, and when you ads there's a chance where it doesn't hit on target without a slight pause while ads.  I believe it was one of the faze guys in the sniper community back last year that discovered it.  So you might aim head it might hit shoulder."
What this filmed on a potato - welcome back 2008
I just watched you shoot that guy in the head 4 times how are people talking about shoulders and marksman rifles a headshot doesn�t take 4 bullets even with an AR let alone a DMR
"You�re using the SPR so I don�t feel bad for you at all. That thing never hit markers, so you must�ve goofed somewhere."
That�s the whole point of using it. I WAS using the Kar until it decided that 90% of my shots would be hit markers. I decided I�d level the spr up since it was level one and I heard it was good.
"Would be cooler if I didn't get the 'fastfile is different from server' error everytime I get to semis. Been happening for at least a year now, on and off."
Never heard of that issue i�m assuming you�re on pc?
Is there a weapon blueprint for the winner
Yes mg34 blueprint that just has gold on it.
Yeah but it's not worth it like the fallen was. It's just a gold version of the mg34.
I hope we have another chance to get the fallen so I can do it on my main account. I got it on secondary.
Not to mention the ADS is that of a pistol damn near
"ads of a pistol, 150, ads of the val, 234, same as the ram7. would you like to try again?"
"Likely because IW / Raven / whoever is looking over the game now doesn�t care about weapon balance. That�s my guess. 

But, yes, Val is ridiculous. Three shot kill with almost 1000 RPM shouldn�t exist. You�re going to get a lot of < 1.0 kd players here saying that it�s balanced, so enjoy those comments."
"They probably won�t nerf it, it has the ammo capacity and recoil that counters its power.. if it had m13 recoil pattern and 60 round then it would need a nerf."
"30 round mags and recoil stock and thats it, As Val is stupid just admit it"
[deleted]
"Tbh, its OP, it have very fast TTK and good Mobility, the only problem is the ammo capacity (which isn't that problematic) and every toxic or trash kid use it as main weapon. But i think its a necessary evil. I dont use it unless the other team all using Mp5 or VAL itself or SPR which all of them are OP. So i think its fair to nerf it if those get a nerf too.

Btw, developers wont care about gun balance at the moment, cuz MP is abandoned now and Only thing that is important (from MW i mean) is WZ which AS VAL wont do good there. So they dont care about it."
I guess it's broken if all you play is Search or StS.
"9x39 is a powerful cartridge vs 5.56 or 7.62x39. Low energy, but high mass and designed to cause hydrostatic shock by yawing on impact."
"This is a game. Where people run around with 50 cal snipers and quick scope people and headshots aren�t one shot kill. The ammunition you are shooting doesn�t matter when it comes to this game. Kar98k fires the same bullet as the MG34, but does more damage. Its all about game balance and not balancing guns based off of how they work irl."
"The gun is fine the way it is.  The recoil kicks like a mule just like the AK.  If anything, the gun needs 50 to 60 round mags."
"kicks like ak? no it doesnt, im on mouse and i can have literally no recoil, and whats more important no horizontal recoil, pattern, or spread. simply pull down mouse and they you go but also 1000 rpm 3 shot range and a built in fucking suppressor. should i keep going?"
"Its not that op I think, but a little mobility reduction would do it I think"
lmao
9x39 go burr
"Its an AR, its meant to outclass every smg. But fact is it still controls like an AR. Smgs still have better mobility"
"it kills faster than any smg up to 40 meters and the mobility is on the faster side of ARs. its broken, dont try to call it balanced"
The gun is good as it is now just deal with it
you are delusional if you think the gun is balanced
Naw see if a weapon kills someone it can only be broken.
"When you�re downed a C4 almost takes 70-75% oh health without EOD, but the guy you were trying to kill had EOD so when you threw the second C4 he would�ve had around 5HP.



That being said Australia has 48million kangaroos and in Uruguay has 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos each."
Is this a copy pasta? Lmao
EOD just shouldn�t apply when you�re downed.
I guess next time just shoot him?
They WAY over nerfed  C4...
EOD is too strong. C4 is balanced now
This is the kind of �I�m not alone� content I like to see!
Wow c4 sucks
That�s a fucking joke.

there was but regiments that already had it still do
C4 is a joke in this game now. It�s a waste to carry around.

This is great. You can only get better at the game from here
Thank you man. I've been getting really good with the deagle. Probably my absolute favorite pistol in the game. I'm working on the .357 now too... although that'd more of a pain lol

Have you downloaded your appdata (via the cloud storage or usb stick) ? For me it all worked fine.
Yes.
"You shouldn't have to sync anything at all.  I've also had a PS5 since launch and was easily up and running on Warzone & MW multiplayer within minutes.  Ensure your Activision account is linked to your PSN account, activate your PS5, login to PSN via the PS5, ensure you have all packs installed, and ensure you transferred your save data from the PS4 to either the PS5 internal SSD, or an external HDD formatted for the PS5."
"According to my PS4, all save data from MW is transferred over. That�s what I don�t get. It says �You already have saved data for this game on your PS5� So now I don�t understand what else I�m missing because it�s transferred over."
"one tap if you aim high, good players with a MK2 is a nightmare"
People rage when you use this thing well
Definitely seems like it can be more irritating than the spr or kar
"Yeah, you need the dragunov, HDR and AX50 gold too."
Already got the ax fuck
Yeah sniper rifles too. Do the draganov first. Its the worst.
No and it�s just the base weapons when the game came out.
No. Only applies to MP and Warzone on cold war�s end.
MW is Damascus. Cold War is DM ULTRA

"I've been dealing with experience n extreme lag for 2 minutes. My husband and I found if you start the game while on the battle pass screen it gives you your experience. Hope it helps. We just noticed it earlier cause I should have been done with our 3 battle pass a week ago, now  barely 2"
"Same with Xbox for the split screen. It crashes to the home menu. It�s been this way now for a while and has made the game literally unplayable for my girlfriend and I, who used to play together almost daily. I doubt it�ll get fixed too, since they�ve been ignoring all of the numerous posts on their support site about the issue. Seems there�s too few of us split screen players for them to give two shits, which is just downright shitty of them. Fuck Activision"
"It's still not fixed? Hooooly shit, how is there no public outrage!"
Also PS4 SplitScreen... and also crashing very often. We went back and forth with Activision support and their �help� didn�t change anything. The only thing we didn�t try is wiping our profiles... which they suggested. It�s been a bad February.
It�s so fucking annoying - Shoot the Ship is finally back and I can�t even enjoy the damn playlist because split screen crashes every single time. Seriously losing my patience with this game. Fix this shit ffs!
Its absolutely awful!!! Playing ps4 split screen online. 2 games in. And crash
Just play Cold War
Worst advice.
"Cold war is without a doubt, the worst cod I've played since Advanced Warfare. I have no interest in that glitchy, terrible mess."
"This isn�t an answer, but it�s a message from Activision. Letting you know your spilt screener needs to buy his/her own console. They are gonna need the sixteen digits on your credit card."
Lmao
"In the same boat bro, this shit is terrible - I�ve considered uninstalling+reinstalling the game so if I remember to do it tonight, I�ll update with any progress. I�m genuinely saddened by Activision�s behaviour, this is clearly them trying to turn players off from the game..."
"I've done this and it doesn't solve anything, it wouldn't be so bad of it didn't crash my whole playstation the first time it crashes meaning I have to turn it off at the wall!!"
I�ve tried that to. Doesn�t make any difference. It needs a patch to be released.
I have the same issue. Did you find a fix?
No
"You should use rpg as the secondary while you do the rest, since you don't know when the air streaks will come.  You should do whichever is the most difficult one, so that you get better lobbies as you go along."
RPG just go for the CUAV�s since it�s stationary
Do any of them while simultaneously doing the RPG
Eh maybe ax-50 or M4A1 I got the 90 buck virsion of cold war to get that weapon variant and now I'm wondering how gold would look on it
"Mg34 for sure, worst gun for me when I did Damascus"
"It�s been 2 days, and can confirm. MG34 is absolute garbage. Still only have it like level 20.

Just why does it have no ammo, a fast fire rate, and a super slow reload."
Have no idea how u have the rpg so high. I hit people directly with it. Then they reload and kill me while they're flashed.
"Well, messing around in plunder got me a few levels, then shipment got me a few more."
"For the RPG: 
With the personal UAV�s aim the direction it�s traveling, usually you�ll hit them.  Counters are stationary so aim as normal.  For the jets, fire the first round then use your primary to weaken it then use the second rocket.  Don�t waste your time trying regular UAV�s. No matter what keep it as your secondary to what you�re grinding.  

For the others:
Choose the weapon you dislike most and grind that.  Once it�s done you�ll have more fun playing."
A tip for the LMG is if you go into hardcore shipment make a hip fire build and spam. It�s a guaranteed 1 shot anywhere in the body. It�s a easy way to get them gold I did mine in around 450-550 kills that way.
"Do AX50 now on shoothouse. Mounting mid is the only way to get sniper mounted left, those are fucking painful. More so than any other weapon 

Run secondary RPG to shoot down stuff. For VTOLs damage with bullets until they start to set on fire then RPG for the destroy. 

LMGs are very easy. Just play Hardpoint and mount deployable covers, you'll be done in no time. the regular ""kill enemies"" challenge actually took the longest for me"
You played to 100 in a random 1v1?
"yes, lmfao he kept saying that i was spawn camping and that he wasn�t ready, just a ton of complaints, so i just played thru to 100"
"If people I 1v1 turn out to be a nice vibe, I might rematch for a higher score. If it�s their first match though, one of them must�ve been very salty.

Edit: I�ve lost count of the randoms I�ve befriended just from 1v1s alone. Everyone should try doing at least 1v1 a day, and it doesn�t have to be about proving yourself as the better one. Can just be for fun and that�s how I started enjoying them."

"The base Ghost skin did not come in a bundle. It was unlocked when you purchased the season 2 battle pass. Same goes for Mara, Alex, Price, Lerch, Farah, and Nikolai (Price, Farah, and Nikolai have not made any bundle appearances yet)."
"oh I see, I was expecting more styles becasue when I bought the alchemist bundle, I got the base style for Kreuger."
By base skin you mean his skin from season 2 battle pass on tier 1?
YOU WON?
"I hope so man, the jug needs a 15 kill streak vs the tank�s 7! (Not including kill-chain)"
no /s
"Ok guys say it with me.

The. Matchmaking. Isn�t. Based. On. Skill."
"It is very loosely. You can see that most players are somewhat within the same skill range, but what I would conclude is that it isn't strict and not punishing you for being good or performing well. Just looking at the gap from worst to best in the lobbies:

Lobby 1: 1.11 - 2.02 (4.22)

Lobby 2: 0.95 - 1.65 (4.22)

Lobby 3: 0.62 - 1.19 (4.22)"
"It is. Your lifetime stats have more of an effect on your lobby difficulty than your 5 game performance. Think of it like a base level. Then that 5 game performance determines if you lower or raise on that base. 

It�s still pretty strong sbmm, but in certain locations of the sbmm tiers there is a bigger gap between players. So say you�re at the top of the 1-2kd bracket, you�ll mostly get matched with 1kd players because you�re at the top unless it moves you out of your bracket. The higher it gets, the less players available in match making and it has to compensate you on lower tier matches."
I'm very casual and playing like once a week but the game puts me against ranks 700 with TTV in their name almost every other match so i don't think that matchmaking is very strict.
"That's what this is basically showing. Despite me being 4.23 kd, i got even matched with some people who are negative overall. That's just about the opposite of SBMM"
"What time of day was this? Along with what server location? 

Before stats were made private, I did something similar. I have around a 3.6 KD, 47 kill streak, 650 SPM, etc, for reference. 

In the morning, which is where I get my best game plays and nukes, I was getting similar lobbies. Mostly around 0.9 to 1.6 KD players. There were outliers below and above, but mostly around there. 

In the evening, where I still do well, but not dropping nukes, the lobbies got more difficult. Most players were around 1.4 - 2.2. Again, always outliers, but the general �skill� level shifted upwards. 

Maybe that�s just my experience, but that�s been a continuing trend for me. Always easier lobbies in the mornings. 

Another thing, at least for me, is the playlist. Hardpoint and Search seem to be more �sweaty� than modes like Dom or KC."
"The first 3 games were around 3:00-4:00 AM, the other 7 between 2:00-4:00 PM

Server location was inside EU every time.

&#x200B;

Going from my own experience, the evening is just mildly stronger maybe, or rather more annoying with more as vals. But still nukeable

About Playlist: I found Domination to be pretty average (it's also got the 2nd highest player count after SnD). Playing SnD or HP i could not feel any difference in skill, just a difference in the amount of as vals, shotguns and snipers"
I don't have a problem with the matchmaking in this game tbh. It's cold war that has earned my rage. Hence why I play mw and I no longer own cold war.
From my own experience i found cw to be at the very least just as easy if it's just about the matchmaking. However the netcode is what really makes it unplayable for me
I just uninstalled it for that reason.
"This has happened to me for the first time today, I wanted to get on and play some sts but my internet is so slow I won�t actually be able to play any today. I honestly wish I never bought this fucking ps5 now"
"Had this too, keep all packs downloaded. Not the most optimum thing, but at least you won�t have to re-download when multiplayer gets randomly deleted."
"This has just happened to me now. Started to reinstall Multiplayer Data Packs 1 and 2 and Texture Pack 1. All of them were installed previously. In-game it says they are uninstalled but when you go into PS5 storage, then the add-ons for MW, they are still installed. Unless it�s showing the packs on the the add-on list despite them being mid-download... 

Does anyone know if we are installing multiple copies of the same pack or is the game definitely uninstalling them randomly by itself?"

"Stop backing out of lobby, play one game of ShootHouse or two then the next will be Shipment. You would�ve gotten Shipment in half the time it took you to write this post if you had stayed and not backed out. No map filter/selection is already bad enough, people lobby-shopping for maps is just gonna make it worse FOR EVERYONE."
Who says I�m backing out bud. I understand how the game works I still get way more shoothouse than shipment
[deleted]
The camps u can grind are very specific. It�s ok for long shots but that�s abt it in terms of ones that are better on shoothouse in my experience
"I honestly prefer shoothouse for two reasons. 1. Its not extremely fast pace but not super slow, it�s right in the middle. 2. Im going for obsidian on my bruen and it requires 15 kills in 150 different matches. In shipment i never get it because all i get are assists, but when i play shoothouse I always get it. So it depends on what you�re going for, pure kills? Probably not your best bet on shipment. Weird challenges like slide kills or mount kills? Better on shipment."
Obsidian on weapons is better on shipment try hard core I've done a shit ton of obsidian grinds lol
I am a hyper aggressive person and I�ve been playing since launch and I have Damascus on every gun including almost all dlc guns. I have never not once preferred shoothouse to shipment for anything except snipers but even then  it was a pain in the ass even then cuz it would have to be a 10v10 for that which wasn�t too often so I did them in ground war. I understand how it can be tough but if u play hc its 100x easier so many be that�s ur issue not the map. The lmgs were some of my favs to use on shipment and I got a 28ks with the pkm on shipment one time
"It's probably mainly due to how a lot of people cherry pick the lobbies, it sucks but there's not much you can do about it besides stick it thru and you'll eventually get a decent ratio of shoot house and shipment"
"Easy fix. Make a loadout for a gun you wanna level and a loadout for a gun you need longshots and mounted kills on. Play one when it's shipment, the other when it's shoot house."
"Sounds like the lobby/server went down. Thatd be my guess, the whole game crashed on Activisions end not either of yours."
My other teammates were able to finish the game since we were 4 so I guess it is something else.
Its totally plausible to crash games via in-game bugs such as the old vehicle bug. Could be something like that or it could've been random
Had this same issue me and my girlfriend crashed mid match with 6634
"My friend and I just had the exact same error today. We both crashed at the same time with Dev Error 6634. He was on the train and I was next to it. Our other two teammates did not crash. We were on PC (both of us that crashed), they were on PS5. This is on WZ Season 2.

I've had Dev Error 6634 for the past few months randomly. My teammates have never had it until today. After the Season 2 update, I see Dev Error 6634 every day I play. Prior to Season 2, I only encountered this error once in awhile, like 1-2 per week.

Dev Error 6634 is a common problem in the past few months."
I am with you on the Cold war. 90% of this battle pass was cold war. Personally I think its a POC.
"i'm having the same issues, any uptdates from them?"
If you earned the base skins during season one then you wouldn�t have an issue unlocking the outfits through the challenges. If the challenges aren�t unlocking then you didn�t earn the outfit. There isn�t a time limit on when you can earn battlepass outfit challenge permutations. I�m still unlocking content from earlier seasons when I switch around operators.
"Hi - i posted this in another Thread similar to yours - but i guess you have to purchase the ""Warcom"" Bundle from the Store to get these Base skins - then the Missions should track. (Unconfirmed) [https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400170-warcom-pack](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400170-warcom-pack)

And after seeing the Reveal for the Cold War / Warzone Season 2 BP - it�s obvious that MW may no longer be supported with unique Content. If they do add some stuff in the Season 2 Battle Pass that�s only for MW - that would be a nice Service - make it 50/50 and i would be happy. As it seems though it�s 100% CW and Warzone only."
"I've been having the same issue. I was really hoping for a fix to unlock the skins with the season 2 download, but now that it's done the challenges for Mara and Ronin are gone"
I have several operators that I have completed the objective for and can't unlock the upgrade.
Dat cheek doe
*sticks needle in dudes cheeks* fssssssss * eyyyy
Isn�t this a very old and known trick? I remember seeing this for the first time in a jackfrags video near when Warzone launched.
It seems so but I�ve never known about it tbh. Idk who jagfrags is lol
"Actually it's a pretty old trick. It originated in PUBG for quite a long time ago. 

When you free fall to a teammate or to a vehicle that has a teammate inside, you will lose nothing."
Interesting. I don�t know why I never knew about this. I must live under a rock lol
"It has come to my attention this is well known, I just live under a rock and never bothered to try it lol"
Same issue here. But exclusively on split screen.
I feel like I�m too old to understand what the fuck the title of this post means
"Imagine (to think visually) panic (reacting due to stress) shooting (firing a projectile) an rpg (launcher) 
Couldn't be me (OP is gay and that's okay)"
Activision doesn't care
"If you get accused a lot you will get reported a lot and therefore need dummy accounts to play on when youre sb'd.  It's just how it is.  If we're not happy with it, the only thing we can do is not buy and play their game."
 The shadow ban is for a week They will run your previous Game files an if they find anything it will be banned if not then it will be back to normal.
Gotta love skill based matchmaking
"SBMM is a bad joke though. I just analyzed the players of my last 3 matches.

So going into this, my 6 games before the analysis I went : 

71-3; 16-1; 40-8; 33-1; 25-6; 32-2; So overall 217-21  (10.33) or avg kd of 16.31

Now for the 3 lobbies following that:

&#x200B;

**Lobby 1**: 

*Enemy KDs*: 1.93; 1.18; 1.41; 1.52; 1.15; 1.11; **avg 1.38** 

*Own Team KDs*: 1.12; 2.02; 1.57; 1.19; 1.21; (4.22); **avg 1.42 (1.89)**

"That is absolutely correct!! Thx for pointing it out!
 I'm not saying i am a world champion or anything. Just above the average player.
Im just annoyed that i can't go 1 game without getting falsely reported to the point of me getting shadowbanned.... I just don't get it"
"Well, seems you have bad luck. I am at 4.22 kd (and further increasing), get accused a bunch, even got accused last game, yet have never been shadowbanned. The only real difference i can think of between me and the good players that get shadowbanned is input method. I use controller"
"Damn! Thats a nice K.D my sir!! Well played!

And yup... Doing good using M&K on a computer, automatically translates into that someone is cheating or something like that...
Well, perhaps i should take it as a compliment that i got a Shadow-ban for just playing like i usually play"
I have been accused of wall hacking in hardcore search on multiple occasions because i like to run fmj and snapshot.
"If people think you are wallhacking when you use snapshot nades they are fucking dumb xD 

Theres a big red box on your screen telling you you have been scaned. Well gess what...YOU HAVE BEEN SCANED hahaha

That said i saw a guy yesterday ranting that combat hardened didn't work cause he dies to grenades. Batlle hardened my dude. People are fucking stupid."
I've run this setup a LOT and worried about getting falsely banned due to reports. Never happened though. OP is either unlucky or suspicious.
"I am a former pro, 3x lan winner in previous COD.  Always play mouse and keyboard my whole life and been successful in league play in multiple games (CAL, Cevo, etc).  Diamond 10 seasons in a row in RB6:Siege.  

I get accused/reported every other game because I play hardcore for the realism and have good gamesense and aim and reaction times.  I also check almost every corner.  RELIGIOUSLY.  There is just something about Hardcore players where they think they are good but would absolutely be demolished in any kind of league play.

The problem - no real anticheat.  The second problem - bad kids report because no way someone can be better at the game.  All it takes is a whole team to report you a couple of times and then you will be shadowbanned.  Third problem - Peekers advantage exists in this game but people do not realize it. Someone coming around a corner will see someone camping before the camper can see the aggressor. It is not as bad as RB6, but still noteworthy.

If you are clean, wait the 8 days and it will clear and go back to normal."
My glasses are fogging up from how sweaty this is. I love it.
"Man, I really hate shipment and this is why. Dying within the first quarter second of spawning."
What platform are you playing on
Very satisfying
I call that a sausage party
"Oh, to have these lobbies."
are you the primary owner of the game? can you list what packs you have downloaded?
Hello No im playing on one of my secondary accounts i�ve always played on. Even before when I used to play the game alot when it was first released it even let me play on this secondary account. All of a sudden it doesn�t let me access Multiplayer. The packs I have downloaded is Data pack 1 and 2. I have Multiplayer pack 1 and 2. and half of the Cold War items are downloaded also. thats it
Idk what�s going on and need help!!
check u need all the data packs and then try opening and closing the app untill it works
"Hey, not bad! If you like to watch sniping clips i have a few montages on my channel.
Right here..

I wish my low ping was like that
I think some guns have higher aim assist than others. For sure the spr has the highest aim assist.
I feel like I do just as good with the mk2 just get more hit markers due to the lower damage so I prefer the spr.
"Yes! Got my shirtless Yegor ready to play in the snow, just in time for spring... Wait, what?"
"He�s Russian, he can handle it."
The new rumored map is a combo of CW fire team maps (along with maybe old BO1 maps ) so we could see both a forrest side and a cold area map
What sniper has the fastest ads time with the right attachments? As far as I could tell(could be wrong) it�s the SPR but I�m not too sure
"When it comes to marksman rifles I believe it�s the spr followed by the MK2, but they�re very close. In terms of snipers though I�m pretty sure it�s the Ax-50 followed but the Rytec then the HDR

The dragunov is not a sniper in my books, it doesn�t deserve to be called one!"
"Congrats on your first collat bro! I've loved the sniping/quick scoping days all the way back to cod mw2, imo it is one of the most satisfying ways to play almost any cod game"
"Thanks mate! Been playing CoD since MW3 but always had terrible internet. Recently moved into my own place and invested in a monitor so finally have a chance to learn. Incredibly rewarding, especially when you use the actual snipers rather than marksman imo"
quickscoping with a *man�s* sniper... you love to see it
Quick scoping is an art
"Check if your account is set as the primary account in the playstation settings.
After u are sure that it is set as primary - try restoring the game licenses! :3"
It is set as primary but I will restore my licenses I usually do it every month but I forgot so thanks for reminding me!
You can remap controller buttons in the system settings
I dont get how standing behind a crate is glitching? Why is it called that? What's the glitch?
Your right lol it�s not really glitching so idk why it�s called that. I just know it�s hella annoying when someone won�t leave that position
He just wanted some head
Where's the snipers?
How hard is it for them to fix headglitches
Damn what a shot!
How do you people see this shit?  WHen I see replays of me being sniped I don't even see anything that's visible.
That called the lucky shot
Excellent shot man!
Hey man nice shot
Happy cake day too!
A reference to filter? Have an upvote!
Good fucking shit man! This needs to go to the top!
"Whoah, thanks for the gold!"
Insane
Man I've dive sniped a guy in tactical vehicle from M82. I haven't recorded it sadly but memory will last till Warzone is a thing.
How are you redeploying with a full load out?
This was on Plunder
Need a console solution to dev error 5476.
Sry don�t know
How much ram
"Have you tried lowering the resolution? The internal resolution, I believe it's named, just a bit, that might help."
"of the game, i have i out it a 720"
Every category
Platinum you mean?
"Well, that's part of the process to get Damascus."
As far as I know you can only get all of them at the same time
LMG
I suggest you just get every weapon to max level first in the order you like and then you take inventory an see what you need and what you have
Helpful.
"buddy, uh, I don't know how to tell you this..."
Try.
"If I'm doing an Assault rifle it will be the  Kilo because I've already made a lot of progress on the camos, so it will be my starter for the road to Damascus."
Lmao looks like someone raged
Just a little.
Is this sarcasm?
"Rage ranting after rage quitting, looks like"
"Honestly, I prefer to face a quick scooper than a hard-scoping camper. One game I�ll never forget, this dude moving around the whole map to quick scope. Never stayed in one spot after killing whoever was there. He dominated. And I wasn�t even mad. I was impressed.  Idk tho, I generally don�t get mad or salty in COD unless it�s something like the whole team camping.

But to be fair a lot of my respect probably just comes from my extreme lack of skill with sniper and marksmen rifles haha"
"That's the best way to play for me, aggressive sniper rushing because if u stay in 1 spot too long it'll lead to the enemy eventually killing you with frags ir something"
"I mean quick scoping does take skill I gotta say. Doesn't make it any less infuriating when I get killed but still, props for more or less taking an instinct shot with a sniper faster than I can pull my gun up and get off more than a couple rounds."
"It takes super little skill. I normally never snipe online because it's easy and boring, but a couple games ago i did. I went 71-3 on the first attempt and had a 22 streak... Each individual kill just felt easy, some felt really cheesy and undeserved."
It really doesn't any skill at all.
"If its the kar98 k, applaud em, its a well balanced gun.



If its the Spr. I understand your frustration. That shits easy asf to use.



If its the mk2, suck their suck, they�re good."
"All 3 of them are easy af, wdym"
"Unfortunately yes, you do."
"Its always a 6 month wait. They've never been lenient with it sadly. The wait will be over before you know it, riley."
"I see. Oh well, thanks"
"Might have been me on a previous account whom mentioned march 1st. 

I was on the phone with Acti a couple months back and apparently people at support have no power at all to issue name change tokens (stupid as fuck )but Acti has low standards so whatever.

Anyway, guy said to be on the lookout on March 1st, so maybe he was hinting at a name change by then? If but for me or everyone idk. But probably everyone since he was so specific.

Season 2 also starts on the 25th so maybe it could be earlier? 

Idk but 6 months is absurd.

I have 2 names right now that I for sure want at least...still deciding among the two."
"Well, here�s to hoping they give us a new set of tokens next season.

What are the 2 names btw?"
"Same with me, it was literally fine yesterday but now I can�t get a game under 90 ping"
Activision doesn't care
Sometimes I get it that lag like crazy sometimes I don�t get it at all
"Try playing in Asian Servers. European servers are the worst. American a little better. Asian is the least laggy in my experience. Still very laggy, tho"
because life didnt turn out how they wanted. so now its dragons breath time 24/7. enjoy
This how down bad mfs play cod
"I got Dragon�s breath because it�s an achievement they you can do, but it�s kinda too easy and I only ever use it in self defense if someone else is using it or camping. A real achievement to be proud of is dual renettis, because to unlock it you need to play fifteen games, then play another bunch with it to get it max level"
I always have a loadout with an RPG playing shipment for situations like this.
just dragon's breath em back with a 680.
I don�t use shotguns. But eventually i�ll have to because it�s one of the last things i have left to get Damascus. it�s gonna be fun
"I lost all progress sometime around season 5. I did the camo grind and unlocked Damascus, not to mention I spent money to buy the battle passes, some skins, some weapons. It�s all fuckin gone and Activision is of no help. I feel your pain bro!"
"That's so beyond fucked!! Everyone talked shit on Cyberpunk (which on console is justified), but I played it on PC and had no issues. Cod mw is over a year old and warzone approaching that soon, and it's a buggy mess!"
You asked this question in a MW subreddit so obviously majority will vote for MW. Do the same pole in CW subreddit and I guarantee the pole would be reversed.
Yeah we would see completely different results in the Cold War subreddit.
Is this even a question
"It�s not.

I don�t play COD anymore but even I can see that MW is far superior and CW is a title that would have been great in like 2017."
"mw is simply the better game. people liked to say cold war was faster paced...but its not, if anything its getting slower, people sitting at the back with their recoilless guns, just going for killstreaks since you get a huge score"
You're not. I have the exact same and the one where you have to win a TDM with her. The operator missions simply aren't tracking because they're broken and Activision/Infinity Ward are a bunch of lazy fucks.
Has it been like this for a while or can I hope for a patch soon?
"If you payed for season 1 and complete it to level 100, then you own the mara skins. If you didn't or miss out, the bug is you being able to see the challenges."
Is this challenge for the original Mara skin?
"Yes? 
I didn�t start playing until season 3, so I�m not 100% sure. But the first request unlocked says season 1 emblem"
It�s a bug
Yep same with me
the finisher is called knife to meet you
It's in the Mad Chemist bundle for Krueger
"I get ppl all the time team killing me.
We start losing, they turn into douches. I�ll take pubs over this garbage."
I can't even find matches in the cdl playlist anymore
The game doesn't have league play
"It does have you dumb. CDL just look in the game modes section, CDL is Call of duty league."
"Not sure if ""pulling out a quickie"" is the phrasing I would use, but sure"
Haha phrasing on the go lol
Pretty impressive you can do this while rubbing one out.
I blatantly camp that shit map and idc what anyone says or thinks.
Nice clip!! That second kill was awesome too
"This will help as you only need the original weapons not the download content to get platinum and Damascus.  When you unlock gold on the extras, they�ll get platinum and Damascus as you unlock it.

https://damascus.now.sh

Thank you kind stranger who gave me a gold award.  It is very much appreciated."
I appreciate this very much
This is amazing! Thank you!!
The only sniper you don�t need is the AMR I believe
Rytec is the unnecessary sniper
"Yeah, only base guns for platinum. The base guns should all be unlocked via level 55 with no challenges."
Good news is snipers were the most fun to level up (except the damn dragonov)
Only focus on the Guns which where there on Release. All other guns came later can be ignored
It wasn't all for nothing. Once you get gold and even more so obsidian on the crossbow every other weapon seems so easy you'll feel like you're cheating.
After playing with crossbow I have been flying through the HDR tonight. I've got about 8 skins left.
harsh.  xbow is the true devil
"Shipment to level them up. Jokr and be held down and lock onto certain areas of the map. For splinter camos, personal uavs, jets and counter uavs count towards splinter camos."
This^ perfect time considering shoot the ships just came back. You can put it on hardcore if you keep getting hit markers on the strela and stuff.
I could definitely do that. how about with the RPG when shooting down uavs or support based streaks? I just can't seem to time the rockets right.
Shoot the ship and tears
cry.
"I forgot the details.... in the standby que, it would replace the person who has left someone else's match and you'd be the replacement. Obviously not forced, you can still just que up for the beginning tournaments."
Wanna take it on together?
"Sure! i'll be home soon. My tag is Black Dahlia but i'll get the numbers for you when I get there. Also, no pressure to do well. I only want someone who won't leave."
This is the newest most annoying single thing.
Oh and I've yet to hear anything but 15s of profanity and racism.
Yeah kinda crazy they allowed that to be added to the game. Maybe at least the top 3 teams only.
"Yeah, I'm not sure why they added this 'feature' now. It was so nice for so long."
"
On console pause the game and go to the audio tab. Scroll down to voice chat and change the setting to �mute everyone except party.�

I�d imagine it�d be the same on PC as well"
F9 mutes all game chat. Not sure if there is an option on console.
"There is but it also mutes your mates, even the ones offline on ps4. So when they're back online you spend 10mins trying to figure out why you can't hear them. Stupid implementation of a feature."
"Thanks for this. It'll help me, but unfortunately my mates use ps4, so their still in the dumper."
It's definitely a seizure trigger.
It�s pretty great takes me back to the old cod game chat days
yeah except instead of 10 people degrading one another its 150
"Well that's it! I'm now going to have to mute all non party chat as it's beyond a joke. That ""feature"" was obviously never play tested in the real world with ""normal"" people as its just unbelievably bad. If you're not in a party I guess you can quit before it gets to that point however to remain in the party you need to listen to it.

I loved death comms too as it can be so funny sometimes!!"
Mute game use discord
Congrats man
Thank you :)
Okay now get obsidian.
hahahaha
"I'm doing this right now and it burns you out so quick, I don't get to play much anymore so it takes me about a month to do a single AR and it feels never ending"
"Yes, happens all the time."
It�s because a PC player with a very good setup and internet connection is host. Console players do not load nearly as fast. If there is not a pc player on the opposite team it will result in an automatic throw of the round because no one spawned in on time.
on PS5 game starts and other team loads in with full team and my team loads in with 1 or 2 players for around the first half of match it stays that way before loading full team. This is in HC Domination
Is that the one for the shield?  I already have it if that�s the case but I�m happy to help.
"Found 4 kind randoms that helped me with that mission. But if anyone still needs this mission, I can help"
I'm on 4/5 as well
"if you pm me your id, I will add you. I can help you with that part."
Put on auto sprint was my solution to this.  Not sure how to remap.
"Just play with Auto Tac Sprint on, it will take a few sessions to adjust to but is brilliant for aggressive play once you are used to it!"
I've tried it as well but doesn't feel natural. I'm not always an aggressive player. I tend to use tac sprint from time to time and it disrupts the ability to walk slow
If it�s on PlayStation you have to go into accessibility in the settings menu and click controller then custom etc etc
Thanks for comment but I already did that and mapped it on L2 but when I double press L2 it doesn't register tac sprint
"I had this problem before exactly as you describe with trying to sprint. Its the joystick. You can lube the joystick with wd40 or oil to fix it, but the way the controller is designed you have to open up the controller to do it. There are tutorials on youtube. Take care not to remove the white plastic piece off the motherboard that the ribbon cable connects into. Just pull the ribbon cable out of the white connector. DO NOT REMOVE THE WHITE CONNECTOR FROM THE MOTHERBOARD. Once you have the controller open you will know what im talking about.

Fair warning before you do this... its actually a fairly easy repair, but if you pull up that little white connector that the ribbon fits into, you will be faced with like 30 teeny tiny wires that you will never be able to fit back inside the connector. Trust me i know this as i did this on accident and had to buy another controller."
Thanks for the reply. Which part of the joystick do I lube? Do i do it for ends of L3 stick or?
They work just fine for me
Do you own the battle pass?
"Your CPU has a builtin GPU. Make sure that the game is running on the external GPU and not the built-in one.

You can change this in the graphics settings of the game."
Multiplayer is smooth but Warzone isn�t so it couldn�t be the integrated graphics
Any help would be greatly appreciated
I fixed it by reinstalling shaders lol
It�s funny I was just going to comment this. I�m always having my shaders reinstall on me so I�m always running into this damn issue
Yea some of my operator missions aren�t working either.
Yeah they're STILL glitched. For every operator actually.
same as me
it might be a visual glitch.
Yeah there not working for me to!

Lol yeah because activision is the one deleting your posts right....
Yeh instead of fixing the game they�re busy taking down your posts by the commanding of Activision
"I got my account back after a week, but the thief added 2FA, so I can play on my console and keep my progress, but I can't log in and change my password, which means every day I just wait for him to steal it back.

I put in another ticket about this problem, but chat was no help and I haven't heard back from web support."
"You got your account stolen? Wait I don�t get it, how do you still have access to your account if they added 2FA?"
Activision doesn't care
"Sadly no other way. Tried doing this mission not too long ago, looked up guides on it and in every single one of them they spoke about the normal spec ops way. After I noticed that in fact it doesn't work I just gave up on it.  


Maybe one day..."
That was my fear. Although I have done 4 of the 10 at grounded. But still long to go.
"Dude, the life cycle already ended. The hell they will rework something in old game?"
Fixes spawn 2 years after the game released *wow*
"This was, more or less, to outline the major issues with this game and point them out so to avoid them in the future. Either way, there's still a MW content drop coming (supposedly) and some patches, so it's still possible to happen. I doubt this would've happened at any point even while the game was in it's prime, but you know, might as well start a discussion. The Activision dev teams (excluding SHG) are too proud to change major issues in the game anymore, so this never would've happened anyway."
Too late
"It's not too late, it's unlikely to happen, but Raven could still do something, since they're not a major dev team in Activision, and they've been commissioned to work on WZ 'till it no longer makes money, it's still possible for Raven to fix MW since they were also assigned to take care of that. Again, it's not probable, but it is possible."
Funny how people complain that they spawn on people or too far from people....
"This game has a mixture of both. I'm not sure what they were going for with the spawns in this game, but they messed up bad."
"How tf did they glitched this feature, wich was working fine from the get go before tho..."
Same problem but mine is on calling cards instead
I�ve posted about this problem in this subreddit [before ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lf69sh/whenever_i_try_to_favorite_a_bocw_s1_emblem_in_mw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)and tweeted at Activision support [here](https://twitter.com/notseawang/status/1358665120285487106?s=21) with my video showing the exact situation and this was about a week ago and last I heard was that it�s being looked at. If you have a Twitter account maybe you can go bug them about this saying you have the same issue.
"Hey mate, just want to let you know that the BOcW s2 title update (1.32) fixed this issue for me and I can even properly unfavorite my stacked emblems. Cheers."
Yeah it also fixed it on pc. Great! (:
"I've had, just restarting your game should work."
Sure!!
Thank you so much!! I'll be on in about 12 hours because of school and I gotta sleep after my assignments. Are you adding via activision or via psn?
"the names are pretty clever, especially with the holger and renetti, because the names sound like the language of the country they originate.

there are just 2 small mistakes, the AMR in rytec AMR stands for anti materiel rifle because that is what the berrett was designed for, also the striker is not an open bolt gun and if it was it wouldnt need a striker, just a fixed firing pin"
"Thank You for the correction, I will fix that up if you wouldn't mind?"
"I�m pretty sure AMR is Anti Material Rifle, like how the Barret M82 is, and this Rytec is the XM109, a probable replacement of the 82"
"yeah that's probably true, I over looked it. Advanced ""marksmen rifle"" makes no sense now when I look at it since a fucking barrett is NOT for infantry at all lmao"
"Materiel\*

It specifically means military hardware and equipment."
"A Fennec Fox also has no recoil, just like the Fennec in MW! Seriously, though, I didn't notice most of the names for the weapons. I just like the way they sound when you say them."
"idk, try to hold a fennec and its probably gonna kick you a bit"
"Couple of things.

A). The ISO could mean Immediate Self-defense Option, since the IRL version of the gun is meant to be for Tanker crews (at least, I believe so)

B). AMR, in the context of the weapon, is actually Anti-Materiel Rifle."
Thanks! Im always willing to Listen to corrections! I will  put in an edit about it real quick
"AMR is Anti-Material Rifle and the X16 is just a .45 Glock, likely Glock 21. Also pretty sure the the CR-56 is based off the ACE-31, which actually does fire 7.62X39mm and looks almost exactly like the in-game one. The ""M67"" mags make sense as a 7.62X51mm conversion to ACE-52/ACE-53"
"Huh, I thought it looked more of just a hybrid of the different models which could be modified to look and act like a specific model. For example, I said it was a ACE 21 since it highly resembled one  but it uses the 7.62, I was confused."
"MK2 Carbine is actually based on the Marlin 336, otherwise known as the 1895. MK2 might be a reference to the fact that the 1895 is basically an upgraded version of Marlin's famous 1893 action."
If you roll your R and say FR-556 you get a sound that a burst Famas
">The CR-56 Amax, And this may just be speculation, but the CR mean Carbine, Since this gun is based of the Galil ACE 21, is a carbine, despite the irl version being in 5.56. Although, this may also be an example of a non specific weapon and is just the entire ACE series.

The AMAX is based on the ACE 32, which is chambered in 7.62x39mm"
"JAK-12 could be based on combining AA-12, which is what the gun is in real life, and the Pancor Jackhammer, which is another automatic shotgun as far as I�m aware"
"eh, The Jackhammer is Bullpup and I wouldn't really consider it similar personally. but that may be it."
"Odin wasn't considered the god of war, that was Tyr. Odin was the wise god, the All-Father, the god of god's. Often it was Thor and Tyr in the fore front of battle. 

The only way I can think of if fitting is that Odin in old English is Woden. 

Although the ShAK-12 was a Russian gun so I'm not sure why they would choose the Norse God to represent it, even though there was some Norse settler's in Russia, the Rus, Russia was primarily Christian and not Pagan and the Norse settled in many countries."
"Striker 45 is LWRCI SMG-45 

https://www.lwrci.com/SMG-45-Pistol-SB-Brace_p_268.html"
"Yes, I know that. The post was more focused on the names of the guns and not the guns themselves. mostly how the gun s name corresponds to its characteristics"
Fair means Fair in german
"HDR also makes sense. The gun itself is entirely fictional, the idea of it's existence is a spin on how people in the middle east make their own custom weapons for combat. And since the HDR is Hadir's  creation in the campagin, it would make sense for it to be called ""HDR"""
"x16 makes sense. Glock has entry called Glock 19x but chambered in 9mm. X16 is probably just reversing the that name and the order of the letter. 

P320 first adopted as Army�s M17, Marine adopted the M18 which is a compact model of p320. So M19 is probably indicate with the idea of future adoption in mw universe.

Grau in german means grey. SIG is a swiss manufacturer and i believe they speak german. The rifle finish is grey IRL. That colour also been called SIG dark grey."
Rogue*
"Sorry about that, Ill correct that"
JAK-12 is based on the AA-12 automatic shotgun.
"X16 is actually a Glock 21, strange that Glock�s lawyers didn�t get released onto IW though, as they are notoriously protective of their trademark (about as DMCA happy as Disney)."
"Yeah, I was suspecting it as a Glock 21 but visually speaking, It kinda looks like a Glock 17 But its chambered in .45, and a glock 21 I believe has a longer barrel, but then again it may just be visuals."
"Maybe the name bruen can be referring to brute, because it's a heavy gun?"
"the CR-56 might stand for combat rifle? like a made-up intermediate between battle rifle and assault rifle, which fits the AMAX because it does high damage at a low rate of fire (battle rifle) but is still full-auto and somewhat agile (assault rifle). the ram-7 might be a reference to the super aggressive feel of the gun, at least personally it has some very aggressive or ""turbulent"" sound design and recoil. you never really say ""ram"" in a gentle context haha."
You�re way overthinking this lmao
AMR stands for Anti Material Rifle though. The RYTEC does just that as its based on a prototype version of the M82 which is also an AMR.
Same here. Done all the fixes that are suggested (opened ports/static ip) and i already play on a wired connection. Started happening last week and every other game is fine.
I�ve just gave up on it man. Today I played about 7 games and after that I could not move at all.
Yep. Nothing new
"You're lucky you can play a few matches. I cannot. Every match laggs, killing takes a lot more than it used to, enemies ""spawn"" behind me, or even in front of me. Nothing works. It's almost certainly another self sabotage by Activision to force us to move to the next cod"
"Today�s been lucky. I�ve had a spike here and there but other than that, it works. But tomorrow I�ll
Probably be all over the place"
Try download the multiplayer pack...if not that reinstall the whole game...
What platform are you on

does emoting or holding stun or wahtever give you 100% snipe hipfire? sick clips btw
Wish they do. Its just a lot of playing and luck ofc. And thank you.
"I made this little montage of sniping with a help of my teammate-friend (who's clips you can also see in video). Whole video is on our YT channel, hope you like it. 

https://youtu.be/G6y3Z-JiV9k"
Better than the 99% but not good
Obliged. I mean I only have a 1.07 kd so I figured meh
Bruh the in-game leaderboard is totally bs
If it�s in almost every stat ya that�s pretty good
In score Im only 3%
[deleted]
Nah dude is no good enough. He needs to be top .01% like us Kings.
"Once again no, not grabbing for karma.. I assumed (and was correct) that its meaningless"
"Those stats are honestly more a measure of time played than skill. Anyone can get 100000 kills if they play enough

Having said that if you have got that many kills then surely you'd be good haha"
"anecdote time!

I used to play bo2 a ton back in the days. I got extremely good in the game and had a looooot of playtime.

But then I found a few people in public matches who had wayyy more playtime than me, one of them was still hanging around a low 2 kd in performance, the other was still going roughly 1.0 after all that time. We're talking hundreds of days playtime btw."
"Idk, I feel like I do good one day a week, then the rest of the time Im an absolute potato running into a wall and setting myself on fire."
"no

kills, wins and score are irrelevant stats. having 100k kills with 90k deaths will put you at a higher percentage than a player thats 90k kills with 30k deaths just because you have more kills, despite the other player being better"
Actually spm is probably the best indicator for telling how good someone is. KD is just a ego booster because it�s such a easy stat to get high.
"Well, top for kills/wins only means you're playing a lot, but not necessarily good.

Top 1% by kd is somewhere around a 2.5kd i think. That's also where i'd say you generally start to be good. Most people below that aren't particularly impressive"
boom boom pow
would rather have a classical music pack with ride of the valkires
that'd be a little macabre
"Ehh. Theres no substitute to the 80s hits, specially with Never Gonna Give You Up and I Run."
Yeah I honestly think they are dope af but maybe that can be a more modern ish
"First thing that I want in regard to music packs is make us create a custom one from all the available, then I'll talk new additions."
"SP-R clips don't count in my book, no offense. The thing is such a cheese gun; never hitmarkers, great ads times, and has aim assist. It's still hilariously broken and obnoxious.

&#x200B;

That being said, I hope you won."
"I will agree it�s broken. I�ve done something similar with other guns, just not on this level. The attachments it has make it unstoppable for SND. I used the mags with more damage too."
I love that midlife crisis you have for 0.2 seconds when your teammate runs past you and your brain is figuring out if he was a teammate.
"Would be nice if they did backstory comics, although I don't think they'd do a skin for *every* operator at least have one ""origins"" skin for one of each faction maybe?      
      
It would be cool to expand upon the current story too like CODM does"
Every time I go there I wonder if there is any hidden egg or something related to that indestructible radio
This man knows his priorities.
"27,27,27

Perfectly balanced"
"36, 36, 36 for me"
I have never seen such an evenly split poll
Amax and Uzi are a lot of fun to use!

Well done OP!"

Are you talking to Activision here or am I missing something...
Yes about Activision...
"Activision jumped ship on this game and raven is holding down the fort with warzone 

The main focus is now Cold War and warzone 


Sorry but it�s the truth"
I'm not sure if you're trolling or if you're serious.
"Happens with EVERY CoD game.

MW2, BO1, MW3, BO2 and so on. Every call of duty gets dropped at some point. 

Sorry to disappoint you."
"Obviously not, MW�s life cycle is over. They aren�t going to be releasing anything now for this game. It was the same in all past cods too"
Well done bro not easy to do
Thanks
unsync music with transitions hurt my brain so bad
I love being accused of cheating. It is the biggest compliment you can get
"Until you get fucking shadowbanned from an evening of reports, or maybe just one whole clan collectively reporting."
Hahaha I know right. I don�t even think I�m THAT good but these guys made me feel like a god with all their rage.
Pure salt. Good shooting.
I play on pc with a high sens. I�ve been called a cheater like 20 times total now
it brings back the real feel of what quickscoping was back in the day. Great gun once you get that sniper scope.
"For the record I stared sniping when MW came out and haven't looked back since. I even included some misses/deaths to show I clearly wasn't cheating and these guys were just real bad. Wait until the end if you want to hear some pure rage.

Also for some reason reddit seems to have compressed the shit out of this video, damn. If anyone wants a full res link lmk, not sure if I�m allowed to link it."
Gg
That�s all anyone does on this map
Well done. Mind dropping the name of the tune you played in the video? I could listen to that type of music for hours.
"It�s actually just a royalty free beat I found online, here�s the line tho: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Shaolin_Dub/dual-realities/some-thoughts"
"Welcome to my life.  I get accused every other game when I quickscope with the AX 50 or the SPR.  Because Activision is too cheap to implement a real anti-cheat, legit pc players are always accused of hacks if they have any skill whatsoever."
"I've had people say I was using chronos whatever and I didn't even know what it was, which didn't help my case for the hackusation. Funny thing is that I'm on PC so that doesn't even apply."
No saying this is reverse boosted or anything. But these guys are literally at the bottom in terms of skill.
"Nah never reversed boosted, but I am an exclusively SnD player who decided to grind shoot the ship for obsidian. Had a couple games on shipment in a row with the ax-50 that def dropped me down a bit lol. But yeah these guys were pretty ass."
"This feels like a big milestone in my cod career. Started sniping when MW released, I usually play search but secoded to grind obsidian with shoot the ship. I even included some deaths/misses to show I obviously wasn�t cheating, they were just awful lol"
"it is kinda fun as long as your opponent isn't a complete douchebag, which they are in like 80% of my games.

Nonetheless, it's free wins"
"What kind of douchebags? 
The only annoying thing is when people leave the game early in fear of losing. 
But I feel like there is no SBMM, which makes it more enjoyable."
"I love it it too, been playing that a lot lately"
I want to see zombie royale and the 3 on 3 mode come back.
Going through the same bullshit for 4 months....good luck.
"Same.  I got my account back, but can't get in, just waiting for the thief to re-steal it.  I currently have my progress back on the console, but I'm afraid I'll lose it again

I see the thief in my friends list, he has a new stolen account at lvl 130, so maybe he'll leave me alone, but mine is 330 and I had a lot of MW BP stuff."
"I had my account stolen, gave up trying to recover, started again going for Damascus a second time."
"This is a big milestone in my Cod career lol. For the record I started sniping last December and have been exclusively using the AX50 since then. Also these guy were really not that good, I left in some deaths and misses to prove I clearly wasn�t cheating."
nice man ive still got a lot more to go LMAO
"Remove your secondary and put the RPG (or JOKR (or Strela) or PILA))) on it and go hunt Personal Radars while working on anything else. Leave pistols for the end and do the knife and shield when you finish the launchers 


Trust me on this"
Shoot the ship is back?!?
Yessir
"Yup, finally got my gold MG 34, I never want to do long shots with it again"
Love my Damascus. Well worth the grind. Nice work DXT
"If Shoot the Ship is still here next week, I'll probably grind the DLC weapons. I need Shoothouse for the Crossbow mounted Longshots and for the AR mounted Longshots

One is hard and the other is just tedious


Until then, resting from the grind (not really cause exams xD)"
"Worth spending hours and hours and hours playing eith guns you don't enjoy for a mediocre skin at best? Was really hoping for something cool like the past couple games, but all I got was some blue pos."
Now run personal radars for fellow camo hunters
"P Radars, CUAVs and a Wheelson, just for fun :)"
"Hey man you unlocked platinum, just wanted to let you know"
"is it worth me getting damascus? all my guns are level 40-50 with most max, i have my melee ar sniper and marksman rifles platinum"
"For now, try to level up every gun you need for Damascus to max level. Then you may think on what you wanna do next"
Congratulations man!  I�m soon to part of that club myself and most without shoot house or shipment!
any recommendations for the launchers? just need those and the lmgs
"* Always carry a launcher.
* Anytime you can shoot something down, do it.
* Killstreaks take a bit more damage than two rockets (other than the UAV and radar), so make sure you shoot them a bit first.
* Always run Amped as Perk 3 for faster reloads.
* Javelin farm on Shoot the Ship."
Why pistols last?
"My order was AR>SMG>Sniper>LMG>MK>Shotgun

At the same time, did RPG>JOKR>Strela>PILA

Before all of this, did the shield in the first place and my knife was nearly done when I decided to go for Damascus

To go full circle, pistols last"
i only have three gold camos ;-;
"My god I would hate to land in a game with you guys, but from a spectators stand point, 10/10."
"Picture this scene: You're playing capture the flag. You push up to near the enemy team's flag is. You haven't seen anyone. Strange. You make a mad dash for the flag and are ambushed with 12 + flash or stun grenades hitting you every .4 seconds. You can finally see after 15 seconds of white, but only to be ruthlessly stuck with 2 thermites or molotovs. Do we lie in wait like ambush predators? This isn't not true."
This is absolutely disgusting. I love it
I love goofy vids like this. Reminds me that it�s possible to still have fun in this game
"Well, not so much for the dude getting flashed but I agree"
"I see a lot of criticism on this subreddit for the game. A lot of it is well-earned criticism. But MW is still the most fun game I've ever played. I don't think it's competitive, but it is fucking hilarious. You can attach claymores to recon drones. You can hit someone with 15 flashes in 10 seconds. The cheese strats in this game are beautiful."

"It looks prettier and runs smoother than Cold War, that's for sure."
I get 100+ FPS on average on my PC compared to 80+ on CW so yeah I�d say it�s pretty optimized
"Nope.

It�s another shit port from Beenox (PC) that since december�s 2019 update, they were fucking the performance on every new ""update"", even knowing the downgrade that the game had. 

No more CoD�s to me."
Do you know what else Bernice does then port the game? If they even do anything else.
"on the Series X it looks amazing, legit looks like a next gen game and cold war doesn�t compare. only the series X got optimized too not the PS5. I get 120fps at 2k, but I imagine it�s capable of 4k at 120fps"
"I'm also playing on Series X, it's great."
"runs extremely well. at 1440p max settings with my 6800xt, i get around 160-180 fps. during cold wars free zombie week, i'd sit around 120 and drop to the 80's"
Cold War is not that good optimised to be honest.
It runs pretty well on pc. Needs DLSS added.
"Mw?  Optimized.

Warzone?   Lel

Cold war? Decently optimized."
Imma hard disagree.
"My brother was a big COD player (ps3) back in the day. Once he went to school and started working he stopped playing as much. Due to the pandemic, he has a little more time at home to play now. He was frustrated that his muscle memory on the controller was gone and played through a lot of frustration trying to get better. 2 weeks ago, I gave him an old keyboard and mouse that I had and he changed his gaming setup. He has never gamed on keyboard and mouse before, and has pretty much learned through my teachings. He is currently playing on the PS4 with mouse & keys. His K/D ratio in warzone has increased from about .7 (flat over 3-4 months with controller) to 1.3 in a matter of weeks with mouse and keys. 

Went from 0-1 kill games in warzone, to averaging about 3-4. 

That�s my story. Might not work for everyone else though."
"For me it's basically the opposite. With Kbm i can hold something around a 2kd maybe, while i am holding a 4+ with Controller."
"Nice! Even if you use MnK on a console, MAKE THE SWITCH!!!!"
"Either one is fine. As much as I bitch and moan about aim assist, it's in the game for a very good reason. Some controller players can fry without it, although the majority can't.

Use whatever input device you want. They both have their advantages and disadvantages."
"If you think Controller is only viable with aim assist, then sorry to break it to you: you're just not good with controller.

I used to play Bo2 even on PC with Controller (which had no aim assist and deadzone locked way too high), but i still dropped nukes on kbm players.

In CoD specifically you aren't at any significant disadvantage with Controller, the game mechanics were even designed with it in mind."
"I hate to break it to YOU, but there is aim assist on PC as well if you�re using a controller. I understand playing this game on a console with a controller, but you had a built pc and still played this game with a controller??? Why? As mentioned above, controller = EZ MODE. 

And hey, if you enjoy playing with a controller then do you!!! I did not make this post to shit on controller users. Have fun regardless :). Just don�t live in a land of delusion and think your skills stack up because they absolutely do not."
"CoNtRoLlErS hAvE AiM aSsIsT!!! Yeah no shit, of course it�s easier with MnK when you practice, hand and wrist versus a thumb, but have you seen some exclusive MnK players use controller? They turn into Timmy no thumbs and vice versa"
How can you use mouse and keyboard on ps4?
Just plug er in!
"18 years of controller play vs a couple of months of MnK play, no shit you�re not going to be as good on MnK; you don�t have nearly as many reps in."
"Hes saying the opposite, that the skill ceiling for controller is lower because of the precise control you have over your aim with mnk. Additionally that your perceived skill as a controller player is lower than it would be if the game didn't assist your aim, unless you play without it to be disadvantaged for no reason."
"Absolutely wrecking people since the switch. The immersive-ness and focus are on a different level. If you want to actually be competitive on this game, make the switch."

"I used to crossplay with my friends on their PC�s with my console. I was able to do really well against them. Aim assist is apparent. Turn off controller crossplay and enable mouse and keyboard only and then see where your skills line up, And this isn�t a really a PC > Console post. This is a MnK > controller post."
"You underestimate console/controller. For one, you can use Controller on PC and get good fps, etc. And you can be good enough with Controller to beat people who use literal aimlocks, meaning that perfect aim is not sufficient to be top tier.

But then again, this is only a tiny portion of all Controller players. Although most kbm players suck hard as well"
Looks like you ppayed enemies with a field of view of 1 hahah. Good stuff still!
"Haha, thank you! Yeah, I was starting to question how they didn't see me! I ended up going 18-1 with a 17 killstreak after this clip ended."
dont know how you stayed in a picadilly lobby
"Haha yeah, the campaign mission is amazing, but on multiplayer it's a headache, you'll either do brilliant or abysmal, no middle ground"
"Honestly I like it just because it's so complex, there's always ground to cover, I think the hallway leading to the garage is the worst part for camping though. Like a lot of places around that map. CTF is fairly easy on Piccadilly on that route though!"
Beautiful
"Ah the angryjoeshow, their skits on reviews are mostly awesome."
Made me smile :-)
ho ho ... fucking too real!  Still funny as hell.
"Shots not registering, no hit markers either just thank Activision"
OK. What is this. Cause this seems all too familiar. Only binge play irregularly and went off last night annoyed with the whole game.
"A tick rate of 20?

My god, Valve�s 64 tick CSGO servers ain�t looking so bad now. . ."
Activision doesn't care
That's the way it is. Infuriating.
Stand up to Joe and Other Joe?
"Stand up to what, corporate purchase orders for bare minimum spec server banks?"
"Coming off of Rainbow Six Siege, it's really a nuisance for me :("
almost like the ending of the fog of war mission but you're just crawling
hey you
"weapon drop weapons have random attachments, its not the same setup every time"
"For whatever reason I got basically the same attachments every time. Just had luck on my part, I was really looking forward to using the full auto CX-9. Guess we�ll have to wait and see if the March 11 leaks were true."
"You can unlock them, and use them in survival too. Raal can't be unlocked tho, challenge is bugged"
"Really?? I didn�t actually know that, thank you. I�ve had survival uninstalled for forever now to save disk space, might need to give it a go now"
"mf called the makarov the least interesting of the bunch

BRO ITS A FULL AUTO 80 ROUND MAG AKIMBO'D PISTOL HOW IS IT NOT INTERESTING"
"I should�ve clarified: with the attachments I got, the Makarov was the least interesting of the bunch.

When it actually releases and we get the full 80 round akimbo shredding machine, THEN it�ll be quite fun. Until I get really lucky out of a weapon drop, though, it�ll remain the least interesting."
"The R in RPG stands for ""Retribution"""
Retribution Propelled Grenade. It's true.
"The split second of looking at the body like 


�Oh I fucked up....�"
split second? That shit was a solid second or more. He contemplated fragging himself
"and you know majority of players dont use headsets or are in a different chat and cant hear you go ""awww fuck my bad dude"""
damn bruh that was a clean flick
"this happens all the time.. you panic shoot one bullet it goes straight to your teammate's skull

but it doesn't matter if you panic shoot whole entire clip on the enemy neither will hit"
You either Wesley Gibson your teammate or Stormtrooper your enemy
"This is my favorite clip of all time. The sudden realization,�oh god what have I done�. The guilty look over to your teammate who you just killed. Your teammate pulling out his rpg to seek revenge, you standing there knowing full well you deserve it. Awesome."
But also him trying to save his ass last second by shooting the RPGer hahaha
A soul for a soul. Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be
anyone saying aimbot is laughable.
"ah yes, aimbotting teammates. fucking idiots."
It's a lot easier to suggest that anyone better than me is cheating than it is to admit I'm not the best player on the entire fuckin planet
"I mean, technically there is, this is on console....... 

So a large part of that aim behavior is indeed done by a computer."
"Killing a teammate:

You know the rules and so do I"
Same thing when you kill an enemy when your teammate�s doing a finisher. You just gotta Semtex yourself at that point
�You get what you fucking deserve�
"""You're laughing. You killed your teammate and you're laughing."""
That last kill looked a bit suspicious
Op shot before completely ads. And it was a hard flick
Can't aim bot a team mate...
Shoot the ship is back. Don't use lethals or streaks and you'll get it done in no time
https://i.imgur.com/Kxrh7QQ.png
fuck yeah a pkm enjoyer
Gotta fix that gamma.
I don�t think this one is all that bad all other guns considered lol
"it could be worse

https://imgur.com/a/rvPpqQW"
glad i am not you
W-o Your half way there w-o we're living on a prayer
I got my first gun obsidian which was my m19 pistol then I got my Amax obsidian and my ax50 is close
"I have got Ak47, FR5.56, SCAR, M13 and RAM7 obsidians, now going for the SKS and ill grind EBR or Striker45 later"
If you give up EDP445 will clog your toilet
oh shit i better get on right now
I got you. I have it on 4 guns so far and now on my famas on my secondary account. You can do it.
with shoot the ship on this week how long do you think it'll take?
"Try not to use only one gun at a time. Gets repetitive. 

I found it better to work on a few guns at a time."
"Got the M4, MP50 and Pila to Obsidian, thinking about 1 weapon per class, so PKM and SPR next I reckon."
my m4 is obsidian and tbh i love feeling like im one of the only people to have it lol most people too lazy to get it. my swords about to be obsidian too
"I just finished the amax last night and have the spr done. The amount of rpg, nades and tactical thrown are a pain the ass to get around."
Hard core shoot the ship. You can get it done today.
You know I thought you were exaggerating but I got 20 points in the last 3 hours I think it�s doable
"I did all the smg but thats enough for me
Now im grinding dark matter on black op"
"As someone who was 4 guns done, just stick with and know that all your work is going into a camp that displays your absolute mastery for a gun you love using"
"yeah man, i really haven't used any guns besides M4A1 and M1911 since launch i would say i love them"
As someone who�s on his last 2 Ar for obsidian I�ll say gas Grenade (yes it�s douche) and stun grenade and Throw those to the enemies immediately you spawn and have on restock and push the enemies. Also don�t use any lethal streaks so you can make more progress it�ll go quicker this way.
"Hardcore Shipment. Learn the spawning points for the enemies which is easy, and use Personal radars and UAVs. Got all my guns Obsidian this way."
"Hardcore, run only support streaks, personal counter and whatever else.  With STS, play HC and you'll get it in no time."
Shoot the ship. Easily and get 1-3 /200 per match if you just use the weapon itself.
"Last night randoms spotted my Obsidian RPG and went apeshit for some reason. They were like ""This guy has a fuckin' obsidian RPG! How the FUCK did you get obsidian on your RPG!?"" Then someone else was like, ""Now if he had a platinum riot shield, we'd have to show some RESPECT to that mothafucka!"" So I switched to my pistol class, where I have Damascus on my shield.

""DUDE! You have Damascus on your riot shield!?""

""Yeah... so?""

""Why are you even here!? Why aren't you playing CDL!?""

""Um... I just want XP and weapon challenges...""

LOL

So I guess my point is, there seem to exist a rare breed who still hasn't seen lobbies full of Damascus, so you can still impress the plebs."
Im at 8/15 on the hdr after months of trying
"Ground War makes it super easy, though, it can be a little boring."
"The HDR was a pain. The ONLY reason I got it fully done was Shoothouse 24/7, that dumb wall had glitch and STS."
*150
"Because you need to STAY. You will get shipment but everybody like you keep leaving when they get shoothouse then the game will constantly need to refill those slots. The map isnt that bad, jfc"
you get filled in to the player's spot who backs out of shoothouse to play shipment if that makes sense
"Oh ok, what do I do to go into a different match"
"I get shipment quite a lot. It�s because I stay in the game. My game seems to be shoothouse 1/2 In a row then 2 shipment then back to the shootout cycle. 

I have no time for people moaning who don�t understand simple game dynamics. If you leave a lobby, you will just join another lobby where someone else has done the same thing. Just stay and you�ll play shipment much more"
That's just you then man.    I'm getting shipment quite often.  Tbh more than shoot house
Well you are a lucky man I need my shotguns platinum and I cant do anything with shoot house
Shipment is literally the worst map if you actually like playing the game
The only reason we like it is because it is easy levels/camos and sometimes you just wanna run and gun and not spend 10 minutes looking for someone just to die to a camper on other maps
Aniyah Palace is the worst map if you actually enjoy the game.
"I can't explain those exact numbers but it might have something to do with the way prestige works right now. Hit prestige at 55, or whatever it is right now, and then, it resets your level back to 1 in the menus, but opponents will see your full level. So if you're prestige 1, level 10, you'll be seen as level 65. Each additional prestige is 50 levels, so if you're prestige 2 level 10, you'll be 60 in the menus but 115 to everyone else.

If you get confused just strap Mason to a chair and start shouting, ""The NUMBERS, Mason!"""
WHAT DO THEY MEAN
"CW's progression fucked up MW's progression. Especially with the addition of a prestige system. I have no idea whats happening, but i have the same problem, and it's been like this since the integration. Says I'm level 89 during the match, in the post-match screen I'm 108, 4th prestige, and then it says I'm rank 55 no prestige in the lobby.

I have never ""prestiged"", and I don't even think its possible to prestige in MW. And the level of prestige I'm at varies wildly. Sometimes ist 1st prestige, other times its 4th prestige, sometimes its no prestige. I was rank 155 before the CW integration."
This has been going on since they brought in Cold War guns and made all the levels sync together. I just like to think I�m the highest level it shows lmao.
"Im currently game-sharing it with a friend, however when I download modern warfare these packs are apparently Owned and I have to log into my friends to get all the others ( which are installed in the image ) all 12 packs are installed but it says they arnt at the top, in the store it says I own the add ons but it also says I need to pay for the rest of the 4 add ons for �50 we arnt having any issues with other game shares and this issue only started happening when I had to redownalod the game due to my storage being full and downloading onto an xternal , many thanks :)"
Shoot the ship was back this morning for me??
I played it last night. Should be back for a week right. Or more?
"STS is here.  But I did it when it wasn't, just HP or 10v10.  It's a good gun you just have to change build based on how fast reacting your enemies are."
"It�s only 15 kills for one �point�. 

Regardless, the PKM is pretty easy to grind out. It�s a very strong gun. 

150 round mag + ADS attachments and you�ll melt though people. I haven�t finished the PKM yet, but I�m usually able to get 60+ kills with it in a decent game of hardpoint. 

I think STS is back now, as well. That�ll accelerate the process."
Save yourself the misery and just wait for shoot the ship. Or continue to play hard point or domination. It�s brutal grinding obsidian on anything but shipment/shoothouse.
"Inwas afraid that i will get this answer... Damn.. 

Does anyone know when they plan to bring it again?"
"Play the gun. That's all you have to do. If you're good enough you will end up with it.

Oh and in my game it's 15 people 150 times.

https://i.imgur.com/Kxrh7QQ.png"
I got obsidian ax-50 on hardpoint only
"Yeah Shoot the Ship is the best way to go but if you get rid of the stock, add slieght of hand, tac laser, snatch grab and either stripped hand grip of the VLK 3.0 sight you'll be good.

I used Hardcore Domination  when the Shoot the Ship wasn't around. Got Rust a lot and even Shipment more than shoothouse.

Totally worth it though.

Currently grinding Obsidian for my Renetti."
"I logged in once after an update and was level 1.

Fixed itself after a day"
"Did your nickname also change at that time? because it made me a ""new account"" with the same nickname as my battle net."
"You were hacked, and it sucks.  Go through the account recovery steps on Activision.com and hope you are lucky. I got my account back after a week, but the thief put 2FA on, so I can't log in or change anything. I have my progress back on console for now, hoping my second support request will actually restore the account to me in full."
I should mention that I didn't get the season 1 battlepass
"I got these missions as well! Tried to complete them but they're bugged, the do not count progression"
When did you last play multiplayer? I was playing about 30 mins ago and I think I was playing with you. I remember you outfit and the loadout. I play on Europe servers.
I last played last night im on American servers
Bruh he should�ve at least said thank you
How amazing would it be to just have an endless sequence of players interrupting executions one after another like a conga line.
what an unnecessarily long video
Yeah I tried to trim it but for some reason it wouldn't
"No doubt man. It is all hands on deck at IW for COD 2022 and I'm totally okay with that. I can honestly say that MW2019 is my fav COD ever. If IW has to abandon continued support for MW to make MW2 an absolute banger, I'm okay with that. Regardless, I'm gonna play MW until MW2 comes out."
I am fine with that as well. The lack of communication is what I�m irritated most by.
"According to ""leaks"" COD 22 will be WWII."
theory? lol isn't this pretty common knowledge. they ditched mw with the last season ending back in december.
We can only hope that they make it even better and it doesn�t come out as a disappointment like Cold War
MW was a disappointment to fans that loved call of duty for its run and gun game
Finally They fixed the XP bug!
The video quality is potato I know haha
Some of the most fun I�ve had playing Warzone was the Zombie Royales and night BRs.
"Cold War is why we can�t have nice things... didn�t like the mini royale better than the plain night mode. the zombie and night modes felt so fresh and were gone so quickly, felt like L4D2 once did with bros.
They have a chance to redeem themselves with Season 2 CW content but I doubt they will."
They said that unlocking sticks is useless they said that they never gonna be useful in warzone they said....
My exact thoughts lmao
New mode? Or old footage?
Old fotage
Old footage when they were running zombie royal with season 6.
Sorry for not making that clear
I play keyboard and controller and now that I've seen what the precision and focusing aim assist do I think its too strong.. I remember back in cod 3 and 4 maybe even mw2 their wasn't even aim assist

"Yes you are the only 1. Nobody has ever brought up these issues before, you are the first."
It looks like you just woke up. This has happened since early December and the integration did in fact raise a lot of complains
"Since cw groundloot pistol can destroy you in close range against mw loadout smg I don't really like warzone at all. That's why I'm no longer use mw to just exp to warzone. I would love if they made cold war battle royale and let our warzone alone. I just hate fact that they pretending that warzone is more cold war and even the game is called cold war warzone but... it's not. Movement is from mw, graphics is mw, most of guns and operators are from mw. But I can't do anything with it so I hope they don't ruin warzone a the end."
 The mw weapons are better only Cold War weapon wort a shit is Mac 10 ffar is overrated
I am 100% with you on the realism filter
"The demo had its own realism tab that i assumed was permanent in some way which to me, added alot to the coolness of this release in addition to it�s classic arcade killstreak chasing formula."
"If you want a solid black skin for ""realism"" in any gun, grind your soul out for the obsidian. If not want to waste half life on that try using some black camo but the only 100% is the obsidian"
"No just use the default furnishing, it often the blackest"
"The only normal handle sights are those from the Frank Woods Operator pack,  cross-awarded for buying the Digital Edition Deluxe of Black Ops Cold War.
The other one is ""Holy Quest"" blueprint that was the reward for a Tournament.
Also about the Battle Pass and CW/MW merge, and missing out : What did you expect you arrive so late that the ""next"" iteration of CoD has been already released and it's first season is even coming to an end"
"Arrive late? I bought game on release and have owned every season, what are you talking about? 

Didnt devs say all content released would be purchaseable at any time?"
The M4 carry handle iron sight are usually taken off by soldiers but I see where you coming from I want an M4 with the carry handle as well
"There are a few M4A1 blueprints with the carry handle sights. Though Im not sure how many are still available. You can check out [this page](https://www.gamesatlas.com/cod-modern-warfare/weapons/m4a1) to see all the blueprints with carry handle sights, though some were tournament rewards, pre-order bonuses, seasons past, etc. Might have to buy a bundle to get it now."
"If you play warzone you can use the M16 from cold war. It comes with the carry handle and when you use a scope on it they clip the scope to the top of the handle just like they did irl (albeit rarely). Also it shoots 3 round burst. But there is a XM4 bundle from Cold War that has a carry handle as well. It's called ""inconspicuous"" from a Stone operator pack"
"Try when possible to do multiple camp challenges at once. Can you crouch? Do that. Is it a situation you can get the kill with a hip fire? Do that too. Mounted kills and long shots were always the last of the challenges I�d complete, so always be looking for the opportunity to earn those. 

Keep in mind different maps will suit different camo challenges, so play accordingly and you�ll have it in no time. If you haven�t done the launchers and shield yet, you�re in for a helluva ride. Good luck"
"I think with mine, I normally do

Ingore spray paint, kills happen by playing

Headshots I ignore for the minute

Crouching, again these come easily, normally done about the same time as tiger

Hipfire I build a build just for hipfire, look up slightly and try to get as many headshots as I can while doing it, the rest just come normally. For pistols, I usually left this till last, because akimbo was really useful for this one, except with the Deagle, it was shit with the deagle

Mounted and longshots done at the same time,

Tiger is just passive, but this is what ive asked for the builds for

Stripes, I normally have sleight of hand on my class, but if im struggling, I shoot a bullet in spawn then reload just before I get into a gunfight

Reptile is easy in hardcore

Lichyard is averagely annoying, it takes me anywhere from like 10-20 games to do, but isn't overly difficult

Doublekills come and go, I don't focus on these

&#x200B;

The main maps I play are Khandor, Hardhat, scrapyard, Shoothouse, shipment, rust, atlas, gun runner and cheshire park with sawmil occasionally thrown in, it depends on my mood.

Kandor is great all round, tyre shop side is good for crouched and hipfire kills, Courtyard side is good for longshots, you can get most challenges done here tbh

Hardhat is great for mounted kills, and if you camp in the room by A, its really good for the riot shield too

Scrapyard is good in every aspect to be honest

Shoothouse and shipment are the goat

Rust is good for longshots and mounted kills too, and just generic kill challenges

On atlas, B side is great for longshots if you camp around there, the other side is pretty good for generic kill challenges

Gun runner is pretty good, minecarts is great for mounted kills, if you camp on the pipe or containers, it's good for longshots and crouched kills

Cheshire is great for snipers and marksman rifles and longshots, there's a pixel peek in the restaurant opposite the shop, so I just kill the campers there

&#x200B;

Done the launchers and shield, the launchers were way easier than people made them out to be, they were just time-consuming

Riot shield was pure pain especially for skulls, but that's done too, as well as the knife, vacant is the best map for these, no discussion. Play hardcore for the riot shield and kali sticks, core for the knife and katanas

Shotguns I did when shoot the ship was in for like a month over summer last year, but on hardcore these can be done anywhere, just dont use dragons breath otherwise you're scum

Smgs I got the mp5 and 7 done over summer too and blitzed the last 4 out over the weekend, the best maps are pretty much anywhere, just avoid Arklov and granza raid

Snipers are best on Atlas, Cheshire park woods and trains on gun runner and maybe rust, hold down longer sight lines where you only have to look one direction

LMGs work well anywhere, really

Ars, im not too sure about, not really played with them much

Riot shield is dogshit, best on vacant tho, the room by A on hardhat is pretty good too

Pistold are goated if you can aim quickly on hardcore, they work well pretty much anywhere, chuck extended mag, mono suppressor, sleight of hand, stippled grip tape and a micro reflex on them OR extended mag (biggest you can get) mono suppressor, stippled grip tape, 5mw laser and akimbo

Revolver Snakeshot rounds, sleight of hand, 5mw laser(1mw laser), stippled grip tape, akimbo (sleight of hand)

Launchers take ages but theyre piss easy, on shipment, take C and B, then with the jokr shoot the wall above A, will kill anyone in that corner, with the others, just quickscope the floor by a flag, should be easy enough, or shoot one of the walls on shipment while stood on your own flag

For Launcher killstreak challenges, prioritise Personal Radars, they count for all 6 challenges so will get you there the fastest, the next best are Vtols and Counter UAVs, as they count as 5 challenges each

I tend to run cold blooded, ghost and amped, but I can see arguments for tracker, spotter, restock and double time, the rest I dont see a benefit for

If youre not the original commenter and you need tips, pm me, I can help with anything except ARs and snipers, Im god awful with both and youre better off asking elsewhere, but I can help with literally any other class

If you are u/theplaneflyingasian thanks for the good luck wishes and I appreciate the comment bro"
"Well, I had [some fun writing this up](https://imgur.com/a/4H0PZOY)"
"AK and scar just do ads they one shit basically no matter what. Kar and HDR don't do hardcore. The mk2 just go ads and with the fal I run a no stock, commando, stippy, red Dot and longest barrel"
"so build the hardcore ones for ads and play core for the snipers, got it, thanks"
[deleted]
"Havent got damascus, I need most of the ars (except m4 and m13) the kar, mk2, hdr m91 and mg34 then im done, but I wanna get the dlc guns done after that, so i figured why not ask while im here

And I massively prefer hardcore over core, so I was asking for builds for hardcore so that I can use them there, because hardcore has different priorities for gun builds because you only have 30hp and no regen compared to 100 with regen in core, so most guns are a one shot kill, I try to ask for builds and personalise them from there, but any help with them would be really helpful lol"

"Did you make this specifically for me?

I read through it when you posted it and didnt register that this is every single gun I asked about, no more, no less

If you did, thank you so much bro, if you didnt, still thank you so much, but its just a weird coincidence"
"for shipment, use the AK with the compact barrel, 5.56, no stock, high explosive grenade launcher, and sight of hand"
"I can speak for the FAL, AK, and MG34.

Top-level opinion: I don't use No-Stock, except for meme-builds. I think it affects aiming-stability too much. For Hardcore especially, you want a bullet to go in the same spot everytime.

MG34 is, IMO, the ultimate ambush gun in the game. The bipod helps loads, as does the muzzlebreak. Otherwise, it depends on your tolerance for it's characteristics. (Full ADS build isn't as awful as you might expect).

AK can be finicky with the odd recoil pattern. You either way to tap your 1-3 round bursts or rely on 5-10 round sprays. In hardcore, this is an excellent rare example of a weapon which is absolutely valid to swap between semi- and full-auto based on the range of engagement that you're expecting. My favourite AK build in all modes is:

- RDS (everyone has their own preference)
- Skele stock
- Ranger grip
- Muzzle break
- SoH or FMJ

FAL is my baby. I could write you an essay on the FAL in various modes. For HC specifically, it kind of depends on your tolerance for Velocity, but I'd just go for a mobility build:

- RDS
- Short barrel
- Aluminium stock
- Ranger or Merc (whether your want more accurate aimed or hip fire) or Tactical (if you can handle the recoil but want more aimed accuracy)
- SoH"
"Yo, thanks so much man, you've written like a feature length essay on this, I really appreciate it
I would disagree with the no stock one though, I'm almost finished with the Kilo, I think I've got 25 or so 3 player killstreaks left to get, but my current build is
The one in this link https://imgur.com/a/4H0PZOY and I've gotta say it slaps, I'm still not the biggest fan of the kilo, it's not a one shot kill, and its almost as sluggish as a sniper so I dont think it's the fairest trade off, but that builds making it bearable

But thanks for the comment, you sound like you know ur stuff for these, and I appreciate the time you spent writing it out"
Why don't they make a fov slider for next gen consoles so when I do get ps5 it will work for it. I would be happy about that.
Because it's not about that. They like crippling console players.
"what did u pick for ""console"" fov? 60 or 80?"
its from a jgod video. resolution is about 82.7
"nobody plays at 120, it's overkill"
Less overkill and more hilariously disorienting. Most stick in the 90-100 region for a reason.
I play on 120. Idk why lol but I do. I�m always yelling at my PS4 friends when someone�s in their �blind spot� and I can see them lol
I play at 120 lol I don�t see a problem tbh
Stop watching cable news.
or any media outlet really. Just live your life with  curiosity and sympathy for others
"No, Roze left the US Army because back then they were ordered to commit war crimes, Mace has a similar backstory"
"Yea, but Roze and Mace being secret MAGATs would be hilarious, right?"
Gtfoh with that BS
"Im not American, i don't know about that, but i Hate People who use Roze Black Skin. Cuz they always hide in the dark corners or Abuse the meta."
Nah that's just shadow company's way of showing they are US military but they are like a private military company that operates outside the rules of engagement and does what ever the fuck they want to do
This is actually really funny lmao
Ikr like it sounds kinda plausible that it�s funny
It would be pretty great lore for a couple of red hat Americans to join the Russian faction haha
all I needed was katana gold to get plat too :(
"You don't know when or what got you banned, you know that right? Just because the last game you played was you using melee weapons doesn't mean THAT is what did it. It could have been the suspicious snipes from a month before (or it could have been a mistake)"
"Support department isn't going to help you with bans, false or not. They don't have the authority. Asking on this sub won't get you help either, because people are either gonna tell you ""Activision bad"" or ""you hacked lol""."
They weren't meant to be visible or available for us to complete unless we owned the S1 battlepass. Them being active is just a visual bug thats related to the S1 vaults that were hinted a while ago.
But I own the S1 BP
If they start working can you please update this thread on how? Please lol I�m on the same boat
Try plunder. I have had success with that when operator missions wont work in mp the currently work in plunder. Field upgrades count as well. Gg
I'll  try that
"I can�t even select operator missions, I can see them, but not activate them."
Mine are already active but won't progress
Same with Dominos and Zanes operator missions i have 1/3 uses of deadsilence but it wont progress at all (zane wont even get any progress fml)
The operator missions are not working for me either ! Maybe there broken.
A bug maybe?
"Wow yeah its so horrible, just don't bother playing the game anymore."
Well that�s a bit much. I just asked a question. A little hostile there.
Yeah that's how non-mastery camos have always been applied to the zodiac barrel. It's kinda dumb
"Didn�t know that at all. Thanks for the info, appreciate it."
My frames are fine but I'm just lagging crazy I thought it was just me. I just reinstalled the game not too long ago too lol
Fire in the whole without bullets
I love to squish juggs.
I can only imagine the rage he felt lol
I would be fuming! He had only got it about 10 seconds before the clip started
should of shot his body right after
Haha not sure there was much body left after the rotas hit him!
Why are most people so bad with juggernaut?
"A lot of players don't actually get them is the bottom line. Longest kill streak for me is 11. Nowhere near jug, and in the other modes I never get the opportunity besides the jugg tdm to play as one. Usually it's the other team rofl stomping me and my team into the dirt with a jug."
"I've had a couple, but I'm usually so pumped when I do get a jugg that I make stupid decisions and die quickly"
Seems about like any time I get a jugg...
It�s for both MP and Warzone
Thanks boss
Do you need all 3? or Just the latest.. does it make a difference if i do not have pack 1&2?
No clue. I installed all 3 and I can definitely tell the difference. No idea if you need all 3
[deleted]
So I�m not able to get it unless it buy it?
You would get more kills if you didn�t sit in the crate. Would help you with the scope challenge.
"I needed to complete th Best of the Best mission and it's final challenge is getting a Quad Feed, it would be almost imposible for me to get a Quad Feed without a kill streak and that's why I needed to calm down a little and stay alive."
"Tried getting the quad feed for at least 4 hours, switched kill streak to precision strike, then did this."
Sell me on that gun. I litteraly hate using it
"I'm just using it because I need to get kills with the APX5 sight, and I like combining russian sights with russian guns.

Also it is pretty good."
[deleted]
That is... Not impressive at all
I just wanted to show an easy method to get a quad feed.
"You know that Simpsons meme of the rich guys standing in the circle while 2 monkeys fight inside of it?  


This reminds me of that lmao"
Lmao yes exactly that
Nah. Only base guns for Damascus unlock. Any dlc gun after that automatically gets Dama when you get gold.
Ah okay that makes sense. Thank you!
No. Not how it works.
Play HC maybe
:( i hate the oden man
"Quick tip: If you are struggling to do point blank kills with the Famas or Oden, try using the Underbarrel Shotgun. They count as the weapon kills instead of attachment kills."
No way! That�s awesome. Thanks a lot of the advice!
FR was one of my favourites in hardcore.  Oden wasn't.  Too sluggish and chuggy
"Yes, the gun weighs alot compared to a Kar98. The AX50 is a huge 50 caliber rifle. I know it's weird but it's supposed to feel clunky, they put alot of effort into making the guns handle somewhat realistic in this game."
"Imagine coming home from a long day of work and hop in on COD just to get obliterated by a guy stuck in traffic.

On a serious note, nice setup bro."
"Funny you say that, last match I played in the car (off of a hotspot) I got a VTOL, Chopper Gunner and Gunship. Ended the game with a 76-21 lol"
He would obliterate them too due to his ping being higher
I�d be that guy
So is every kill you do now a road kill? Just Curious..
this made me breathe through my nose
No because he�s parked in his driveway.
Did you actually unlock her though?
"No, I got the anime bundle"
I have the same problem with the domino ones
"> What made you guys (the newcomers) join? 

Sniper and marksman rifles.. this is only reason i chose to buy modern warfare over cold war

cold war snipers are so slow and boring. and do not have maksman rifles at all

i fell love with MW guns  when i played free warzone"
"Ahhh I see, gun lovers will definitely choose MW, because its so natural.

One thing i notice is that CW snipers tend to lock onto wherever you're pointing when you aim before the scope actually align with your 'eyes' while MW guns is smooth & natural in that transition"
"Well considering I�ve always wanted the game and finally got it, his seemed appropriate.  I alternate between Cold War and MW on the daily. Both great games, although Cold War needs to step up their shit because there�s so much wasted potential. When I get sick of one I hop on the other, and once I�m done with both, I hop on Ark, Apex, RL, Siege, Rogue Company, or Minecraft to have some variety. Gotta keep things fresh."
"On my grind to Damascus and googling load outs etc, many results were this subreddit, so I ended up creating an account."
Ah i see!
That game is such a dumpster fire not even Nuketown can save it. I love Nuketown but I can't play that game.
"Because CW is a good game but it should of been on the IW 8 engine and delayed 2+ years, and because MW is fantastic and could of kept the player base happy for 3+ years and continued to be updated after CW's release."
"Should have, Could have*"
Fr it�s feels like I�m playing call of duty roblox on cw
"Modern warfare is still relevant game and the best call of duty on the market. I think there was a sale recently as well? 

It's pretty funny how much bigger and more alive this sub is compared to Cold War even when it's a year old game. Shows where the interest is."
Yep agree haha
"I�m ganna get downvoted for saying this but you know MW has more sales because Warzone, if warzone wasn�t physically connected to MW, CW would be more popular, and it has more people on the sub but it�s been around longer, MW subreddit had the same amount of followers that CW has right now."
Or...because of Warzone
I've been playing since release but i only just made a reddit account
"I see, thanks for the answer!"
Same.
New player here (4 days in). Bought it because im taking a break from WoW hehe. Honestly wish i bought MW sooner because im really enjoying the multiplayer. The last time i played cod was MW2.
"I see, welcome welcome! Don't let the occassional toxicity weigh you down haha"
"The youtube community still being incredibly active on this game helps. The first month and a half after CW's release were interesting because you could see these youtubers trying to switch to CW even though I'm pretty sure their analytics were telling them it was a bad call.

Jev himself said it the other day, upload anything from Cold War and the analytics are meh, but put ""Obsidian"" in the title and it jumps through the fucking roof.

Handler, Kitty, Agony, Exo, Futives, they're all still uploading MW. Jev has recently started uploading MW again but I'm sure he'll stop again first chance he gets. He's the only one on that list who doesn't actually believe MW is the better game, though he does acknowledge it has the better engine and gunplay.

Marksman and Spratt on the other hand are still uploading Cold War. You can't get em all. If anyone would rather play CW it's fair game of course but I don't think the previous-year CoD has ever been this popular this shortly after the release of the latest one, ever?

I played Cold War for a month before I released that playing it slow with a Stoner is literally all you need to absolutely dominate in lobbies. The more mobile you play in that game the worse you do. Play it slow, careful, hang in the back, choose a weapon with a short TTK, and it's farm time. That's no recipe for success for me. My MW stats are still in the toilet and it's the game I love playing."
"Wow i love everything you said hahaha didnt know there were these many MW Youtubers, i've only discovered Warzone youtubers so far like Westie & Jackfrags, bout time i watch these guys"
Cold War was my first COD game after I built my PC. It was so trash and frustrating to play I bought MW. I'm sure I wasn't the only one.
"I see, welcome to the light my friend, too bad MW is no longer updated"
"Cold War is so bad that I have downloaded MW again. Now, I have been grinding it for 5 days!"
"Because Cold War is , I�m not exaggerating the worst cod they�ve released it is somehow CAMPIER then Cold War and somehow they made the spawns worse then MW which I truly thought is an accomplishment on how fucking incompetent these devs are. I can play Cold War for MAYBE 13 minutes max. I can at least ply MW for a few hours before getting burnt out but Cold War is just so so so so goddamm bad"
"Me too, played Cold War, just can't stand it"
"> Cold War is ... CAMPIER (than) Cold War

You should probably delete your drunken post."
Spawns aren�t worse than MW19. I feel like most people with at least some map knowledge and game sense will agree that MW19 had some horrendous spawn logic.
"I think your overreacting on THE WORST COD. If CW was on the Mw engine, and everything else stayed the same from CW(perks, spawns etc), then I think it would be the best cod of all time. MW has some issues like spawns, map designs, and perks like ghost being broken and battle hardened doing nothing. Hopefully these will get fixed in the next game"
I played mw since launch... but I came to the sub at the end of mw life cycle because Cold War is fucking terrible.
I have had modern warfare for a while but haven�t played it much. When quarantine started I played more and then really got into it when Cold War came out. Also Cold War is a trash game so modern warfare is going to be my cod for a while
"Haven�t bought CW and never will, MW is superior in every way. Haven�t maxed a single CW gun either, MW guns just feel so much better"
You haven�t even bought Cold War yet you know for a fact MW feels better?
">MW is superior in every way

Doors, no dead silence, horrific spawns, etc."
Cod Cold War is a broken joke.
Warzone is the reason behind the increase.
r/CODWarzone
MW 2019 was the number 8 best selling game of January 2021. I think the game still has life.
"Check you privacy settings there is one about who you can receive friend request from make sure it is set on the option you prefer, and not set to no one or never. I forget exactly how it�s worded."
"Hey I�m just wondering here - is this a ps5?

I ask because my ps4 has notifications in the top left, and it doesn�t look as clean as this screenshot."
Yes this is ps5
Most likely not sadly I play on Xbox and play station and it annoys me when I�m on Xbox becuase I have all that stuff unlocked and on Xbox it just appears as default stuff so annoying
Infinity Ward left a lot of content unreleased before bailing out. Doubt they�ll do it at this point.
"Edit: Title-not warzone packs, but instead, the combat packs"
"Sorry for the bad screen shot, I panicked and then died haha"
"It�s fucking bizarre the assets for the scorpion, makarov, and the SIG 338 design, have been in game for months and they still haven�t commented when and if they�re still going to fully add them in."
"Ya it's really weird, I've been playing with the weapon drop field upgrade trying to get those now haha, it's probably invain."
"Makes me think they're just not coming, but they don't want to tell players that because some might drop the game entirely since there's nothing to wait for."
Did you get to shoot it? If so how did it handle
"I tried it twice. It's really awesome, I�d say similar to BO1's M6, and also so fun to use. IG It'd be the second best LMG in the game after the PKM."
"Ya, it has pretty heavy recoil but a slow rate of fire so it seemed manageable if I could get more time with it."
Can you get it in survival? Like the Sykov and the cx-9?
"Mmm not sure, I deleted survival awhile ago for more space. I'm on a baseline ps4."
"Got an update, I found the cx-9. Its was ok but 20rd mag sucks"
"It's an UI bug. Several Operators with missions will show this, regardless of whether you have the mission or not. I have visible missions for Gaz and Ronin, despite not owning the Gaz bundle (or the unreleased Ronin tracer bundle)."
Did you get the gaz skin in season 6?
"I use Wyatt all the time, only because he's an Aussie, that's literally the only reason"
Yeah hea the closest thing I can get to mozzie from r6
Damn well I sure haven�t played enough snipers. I would have aimed super high above the helicopter anticipating super high bullet drop
I'm sure you can pull off one hell of a shot too!
Oh wow no bullet drop it seemed?
"I once got a kill on a guy on the roof of the tall building downtown all the way from the dam. 

But that's a whole other story.."
I've listened to this like 10 times and can't hear a single curse word
Where you guys saying it too? Makes you just as bad as him if your not black
what am i supposed to see here
I�ve seen this happen with a lot of blueprints. You just need to add on a different barrel attachment (one that isn�t the mini) and it should fix it.
Hang in there...there are a few lines of code in this game. I�m sure they�ll fix it.
This was so aesthetically pleasing to watch lol
Pretty frustrating since it was my favorite MP5 blueprint because it kept the design of it's mini barrel even when you don't have it on.
"This isn�t a glitch, this has been a thing since like March of last year when I got my Damascus and tried it on some of my blueprints. Some weapon blueprints just don�t cooperate with the camos. You�ll just have to deal with it I�m afraid."
The fuck you using the mini barrel for? Shit is ass
I thought this was intentional
"The barrel looking the same even without the barrel attachment is intentional, however when you do remove the barrel attachment, camos start glitching out. You may not be able to see it, I might post a zoomed in video."
"Did you try moving your mouse over the gunsmith icon? You have to select heatcycle so it will give you that custom barrel.

Edit: for some clarity i mean at 0:19 mark. to the right of FSS mini."
"When you select an attachment on a blueprint that includes that attachment, selecting it defaults the blueprints design of it"
Am I dumb? I don't see a change in the camo
"About 14 seconds into the video, when I take off all the attachments, its most noticeable on the top of the barrel. It looks like 2 layers of damascus clipping through each other."
"It's been like that for a while, actually.

&#x200B;

Bothers me as well."
"That actually just convinced me to grind for it, I love the look of that barrel but hate the stats. Now I can have both haha thanks man"
In my opinion the actual gods at quickscoping are probs in multiplayer on other game modes.      I mean I am not good at quickscoping but when it comes to 1v1 me bro it's a diff story.       ( Don't comment about my name it was my old account name)
"Well good luck with not getting constantly asked for 1v1s. Also, 1v1 me bro."
what were you using for quickscoping? kar and spr are really easy to use. ax50 is not too hard. hdr and rytec are hard and the dragunov is very hard
AX-50 for the most part. I do have a history of snagging the enemy�s SPR and using it against them. Is weapon snagging inherently bad in CoD?
quickscoping is low-skill
"Honestly, I was expecting that answer. Not to say I�m mad or anything, I just usually suck at FPS�s, I think, so for me to be able to pull all that was something I had to suspend my disbelief on.  Also, Christmas noob here just for extra context."
"Why does this topic keep coming up every day for the past 2 months? They will be released whenever Daddy $ATVI decides so. 

1. They were made for a season 7 of MW which may never come out and people wanted them to be finished just for the fun of it.

2. They are waiting for the almighty $25 bundles to be finished for them before being released

3. The best HOPE would be season 2 of CW with new WZ content since they can be found in plunder."
I had the Cx-9 come up on my screen saying I unlocked it while playing multiplayer and the little green tick is stuck on my weapons category now BECAUSE IT DOESNT EXIST
If you play survival you can test it out
On console the sprint button clears that iirc
Why would they fucking remove them it's literally free bundle money for them. If they were planning to never release them them tell me why they finished the model and attachments for the RAAL.
I noticed that today. Annoying as shit.
Probably has to do with getting stuck with a shitty host. I found that if I party up with friends i could connect well to it wasn't as bad.
Host? I thought we�re playing in dedicated servers?!
Idk but this is the one and only game I lag my ass off. I don't even lag in warzone bruh just the multiplayer
Most of the connection issues people deal with comes from server congestion so there's no way to fix it other than to wait until Activision-IW and Raven fix their server stability.
Nobody died from behind including you
I guess that makes sense but is still weird
Yet they for the blindsided for most deaths from behind at the same time.
Lately they have been lying with the accolades..
It doesn�t just like this games spawns
"Ill get most pistol kills in a plunder match, where i have not laid 1 finger on a pistol"
Because no one got a pistol kill probably
I'm pretty sure the no deaths from behind commendation is bugged or something because I get it literally after every round
"I'll just leave this here for reference: 

[https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call\_of\_Duty:\_Modern\_Warfare\_(2019)\_commendations](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_(2019)_commendations)"
No one died from behind. So you either all got it or you in particular got it.
I got most pistol kills in the 3 v 3 sniper mode the other day.
This has happened to me so many times it�s not even funny
IM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN KILL ME FROM BEHIND
Blindsided means you killed the most people from behind. Sixth Sense means you didn�t killed from behind.
"Wrong.

Blindsided is most deaths from behind (ie: people killing you)

Flanker is most kills from behind (ie: you killing people)

[https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call\_of\_Duty:\_Modern\_Warfare\_(2019)\_commendations](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_(2019)_commendations)"
U got the most kill from behind but you didn't die from behind.
Because the ~~participation award system~~ accolades are meant to let the player know that they are a winner ~~even if they were absolutely stomped in the match~~. You have all those awards to prove you did something.
"One is kills you made, the other is kills against you"
Wrong sub
Warzone is in the mw game
"They usually stay showing in the store itself for at least a few days. Sometimes weeks. But as long as you�re in the modern warfare multiplayer menu, you can go to any gun and click on the store button beside gunsmith for that gun and access basically all the bundles that have been released for that weapon. So if you go to MP7, Kilo or FR5.56 it should always be available for purchase."
Thanks man I appreciate it
If it does go out the anime pack is one you can find in the armory
Thanks
"Hey so, not sure if you're accessing the store through Warzone or the actual Mw19 multi-player, so I'm just going to explain it anyway:

About 90% of the MW19 bundles are taken out of the Warzone client completely, and only purchasable through the MW19 multi-player store.

I wanted the blue RAM blueprint, but it was just not in the Warzone client anymore, so I reinstalled the multi-player to check, and tadaa, there it was.
If you're already doing it through the multi-player, I guess they must have, or it's yet another bug."
"Thank for the reply, I�ve checked both and it�s completely gone. I�ve been grinding for obsidian just for this specific camo combination and it crushed me lol"
I noticed the same thing yesterday - devastated! Hopefully it comes back in soon!
Same I�ve been checking the store every day!
Damn that looks smooth
"Buttery smooth my guy, but it�s not available anymore unfortunately"
Sometimes you have to accept what the call of duty gods give you
Kill cams don�t accurately show what was done. That and/or lag and ping
Since when an M1911 gets you a one shot kill?
Gunfight has no health regen
"Killcams are not actual game footage. Also MW uses projectiles not hitscans. Hitscans register whatever is under your reticle when you squeeze the trigger whereas projectiles account for bullet drop, velocity, leading and whatever other rules along with and actual projectile (bullet) needing to hit your target.

In this case bro.. looks like he curved the bullet lol"
Therefore meaning that in fact there was a second spitter!
"[I've been researching netcode](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) for my game, and one interesting thing is everyone who is not you is displayed in the past. It's generally accepted that if the shooter gets a hit, in this case you, the hit should register even if the victim has already ran past the point where you shot.

Now for me to pull a guess out of my ass: Maybe your victim didn't actually successfully jump forward, but your client's interpolation decided that they did. If this is the case, it's possible that the server updated their position just as you shot (or slightly before). So according to the server, which is authoritative, your victim actually was where you aimed your shot, but your client hadn't fully updated with the server due to lag."
"I feel like part of this has to do with the low tick rate of COD titles as well. They simply don�t update hitboxes fast enough compared to many modern shooters. It�s what causes so many discrepancies in killcams, or at least plays a major role in it.

I�m not sure that they have ever revealed what the tick rate of the game is, but I wouldn�t be surprised by 30 or less"
"I don't clip my games but I had a kill cam two days ago, I missed dudes leg by 3 feet. embarrassing..."
"Lag compensation and/or killcams aren�t a recording of what happened, they�re a recreation based off of (sometimes slightly inaccurate) player movement data"
"I mean what did you expect from the franchise that is now fully catering to people who can�t hit shit? Dude missed his shot by a mile or the killcam is shit, maybe the killcam is just shit really."
"Its the kill cam, whenever I get the last kill it's super clear on my screen but the kill cam is always fucky"
"been in the game for a month and change, still not equippable outside survival"
MW2 2023
*bruh* no way
Only god knows....
Never
"I just tried uninstalling the game through [battle.net](https://battle.net) and then uninstalling [battle.net](https://battle.net) itself

restarted the computer

reinstalled [battle.net](https://battle.net), re downloaded MW. It launched into the intro video, crashed for a DirectX reason when it got to the 'choose your audio functions' and now it's back to black screen only, no audio. Task Manager shows a leaf next to the game after a few seconds and the DirectX diagnostic tool is suspended in it.

I tried reinstalling DirectX, no change."
"based on another thread where someone said they had a problem with their windows user account and reinstalling windows fixed it, I tried something:

* Logged in as a different LOCAL account
* logged into [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) and launched CODMW
* upon starting there was an in game message about patch corruption and to click continue to clear cache and restart.
* Game started fine. Got into menus and everything.
* Closed game and logged out of local account and back into my account
* launched game
* works."
One of the lesser talked about cheesy guns in the game
"Marksman rifles in this game are all cheese lol. They have zero flinch, consistently one-shot, have snappy as fuck ADS times, and have AIM ASSIST. I say this as a console player, no gun that can one shot kill should ever have aim assist. Quickscoping requires zero skill in this game lol."
Let them fight.....
And get real low to the ground to avoid the crossfire.
The Battle Of The Juggs
Perfect porno title
Team Deathmatch except everyone starts out with jugg. Would be a fun one time mode
JuggShip
All I hear is the terminator music in the background
"Now I want them to replace the juggernaut skin with one of these terminator robots so bad:

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tnbs-terminator-roleplay/images/b/b9/T800.jpg/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/450?cb=20190606024447"
"*hears enemy Juggernaut appear*

OP: 'Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!'"
two will enter one will leave!
"So theres a jug pre firing an angle cus he has infinite ammo? 

*Let's peak it*"
"I got this battle once inside GW , truly rare battle"
I like how it was a revenge kill as well
"Oh yes, that guy killed me a couple kills off my nuke with his As Val. He had it coming"
Darth vader goes hard at the start there
That�s terrifying
I would honestly stop what I�m doing and watch
Was that Hardcore? If so good shit that fight was badass
"No, it's regular core :) That game i was trying to go for a nuke with my Striker-45 and died on 25 :( i went 55-1 that match"
"In onslaught a few days  ago, I picked up the juggernaut and my 2 friends got the kill streak so the enemy team was against 3 juggernauts, was the funniest shit hearing death comms"
god i want that gun pack so bad
[deleted]
"maybe you can talk to activision support on Twitter, at least they are more helpful there than their own website."
I don�t see how that happen both my ps and box accounts are linked and my stats are the same on both there shared stats
I don�t think you can move stats across platforms
"The stats are tied to the activision account, not platform specific account."
"Turn on aim assist. You could always get a device like a Titan Two to adjust your controls more precisely than the game will let you. Heck they will even let you use a keyboard and mouse on a console, even if the games don't support it."
I don�t want to hack but what is titan two?
"Using a kontrol freek (or any knockoff brand - I think even Amazon Basics make their own) on the right joystick makes a world of difference in precision. 

They aren't gimmicky like a lot of ""gamer gear"" - increasing your range of motion has an obvious statistical advantage in precision. It allows you to use a much higher sensitivity while being able to make minor precise movements that only a lower sensitivity would normally allow."
"I have KontrolFreek and their precision rings to make the stick stiffer, still no luck but it�s better than before but still unacceptable for me."
"Do you have anything specific questions about it that i could help you with? I am one of the better Controller players overall, so all you have to do is ask :D

For sensitivity: I play 11-11. Try finding a good balance between precision and reaction time. 3-3 will definitely be too slow, 14-14 can work easily.

For the most part you need to practice. Not against bots or walls, but actual human opponents who will try to avoid your shots."
"I have a question, I lack the skill to move the center of my screen when I see someone, it�s called flicking I guess and I suck in that, also, I usually don�t know where the center of the screen is, Yes I do see the dog in the middle but it disappears because it�s so little and faint. Any tips for that?"
"Have you tried lower down the ADS Sensitivity Multiplayer? I used to play on 1.00 Ads settings but turning it down to 00.75-00.80 helps my aim better, fyi im using 7-7 sens."
"But the same would do if you lower your overall sens, when I lower my ADS sens, it becomes inconsistent and I can�t track at that point, always falling behind..."
"Just throwing this out there because I went my whole Damascus run with motion blur on, but have you tried turning off motion blur?

Other than that, choose a sensitivity and get used to it. Whe you're in the zone you can hit anything really."
"I have motion blur off since the moment I downloaded the game. I can�t find my sens, If it was that easy, I wouldn�t have asked. Thanks for trying though!"
"Set deadzone to as low as you possibly can handle.

I play with 0.00 with some noticable drift but my accuracy goes down if I play anything higher

Idk if linear in mw is actually linear according to some posts here so I just play on standard"
Play doom eternal best and fun way to improve your aim
"When I used to play controller I used 5/5 dynamic with 1.00 dead zone I just used what most pros used and stuck with it I also played a lot of shoot house with bots when they take out shoot the ship (because only good maps) also try learning to bunny hop and slide canceling.(if you have paddles it�s easier to bunny hop) also try sliding around every corner, it�s very over powered and really dumb for not getting fixed but use it to ur advantage"
"Man you wont like my answer. We are talking about days and weeks of tweaking your stuff.

So first of all you need a tester weapon. Something that is very stable and fun to use. M4 or Kilo would work. If you keep switching weapons you don't actually improve cause you spend all your time adjusting to you gun. So once you have a nice gun that will shoot straight, you start on the low end of the sens bar and you go up. Try one game per point. Each game go up. You'll find a comfortable spot at some point but you are not done yet. Once you think you found the spot, go up still. Do the eye test method. A is good? Is B better than A? B...A. ok B is better. Is C better than B? And so on. 

Honestly just stick with the acceleration tho. The one in MW is pretty good. Linear is wack man! On M&K it makes sense. Controller is a different game."
Downvotes? What did you want to hear just hack instead??? Fucking bunch of loosers.
"Here it is HoneyNutz...

Dynamic
Sens v and h = 6
Ads sens both 0.93
Deadzone 0.23 -0.25 play with this number a bit
Stick and move layout. Turns your r3 into jump and your A into melee. Can't tell you how many time clicking r3 with it as melee fucked me up mid shot. Now I jump shot on accident instead which fucks with the opponents aim assist anyways

You don't need fast sens. No pro plays with anything higher than 6 most play with 5."
"if someone bunnyhops in front of you, you won't be able to track him with that sensitivity, lol. And no pro plays higher than 6? One of the best cod players plays somewhere around 12"
Get a Cronus Zen...it�ll help you alot in aiming and control recoil very well.
"Yeah but that�s because it got more aim assist and anti recoil, as I said before, I don�t want to hack."
Amazing
FaZe Baby
Lol should�ve told him Fortnite is that way �>
I�m now playing the heck out of the game
same. a lot of people are gonna come back when they hear about STS returning. player count is gonna gonna go back up these next couple of days. im also expecting every lobby to have people running AMAX and SPR to try and level it up.
That�s sooo fax let�s go bois to the grinds back on
You guys really get treated like shit for 3 weeks straight and are thanking them for fixing the issues they created. Aight
This sub suffers from serious battered wife syndrome lol.
"I specifically said this seasons season ago, every time sts is back, thank you IW, when bullshit trickle content feed is the problem.  Now theyve fixed XP, are there any compensation or repercussion?  na."
Thats the reason i downvoted this post.
Sounds like every girl with a shitty boyfriend
haha ngl i made a whole post saying fuck activision not too long ago
That�s true because I was on my hands and knees prayin for this fix but I still DEEPLY HATE THEM
"Think I'll stick to search, but I'm glad they're fixing some things and adding good things back"
You best not be lying I've gone 2 weeks without any match xp
nah it just recently got fixed. like today morning it worked for me. i was also facing issues for 2 weeks until now
I lost interest in the game but I�m gonna be back cause I want them to see the increase in numbers of players when STS comes back.
Love your work bro
I played MW today and I actually enjoyed it (mostly played STS and ground war). I might come back and play this game.
I was going for plat ARs and after they removed Shoot the Ship I stopped my grind. But since they brought it back they have me back at it.
"I kept going even when they took it out but it was a pain. leveling up on those other slow maps is hard. ARs need to reach level 65 so you can get all the camo challenges unlocked. But I have most i�ve mine done by now, only the AK47 left and i get platinum. It�s gonna be a fun gun to use"
WE ONLY WANT SOAP
more interested in the CX9 but ok den
Now just fix every other day one bug and glitch that we have known about since release... :v
which one?
Yaaaay I just got on to play
"Did they release the missing, but completed DLC weapons yet for MP? Been waiting for some new content to play MW again"
That comes out S2. but i do remember someone on this sub was saying the saw a guy using the unreleased LMG on shipment somehow
Shoot the shop is back? Back to COD i go
They really robbed you
I�ve had this issue too. Due to the xp glitch I wouldn�t be able to make it to 100 in the battle pass so I bought some cod points. I ended up buying the remaining tiers which would have only cost me about 1800. After I bought cod points I ended up with 3100 and when I bought the tiers I only had 500. They�re seriously fucking some shit up. It can�t be this hard to fix simple issues.
"good luck with support, keep me posted if they helped you out."
"YES, I finally found someone having the same problem. Short version I chatted with Byron and had the same results(them sending the case forward). I found your thread while chatting. I lost the 4800 I had left from my Modern Warfare preorder last week and I lost almost all I purchased yesterday. 8k or so in total.

I understand support agents cant help but they really need to fix this shit."
"I hit up their twitter support and it's crickets. Fuck activision, they scummy. We need to keep upvoting and see who else activision fucked over and  band together"
"https://codmwstore.com/operators-identity/deadly-grip/

Not sure if that's the exact same one."
You are a top guy! It is that one but 2400 cod points is a bit steep just because I like the emblem hahah! Thanks bro appreciate the help!
yep especially on hc
Maybe its harder to do on console since you can't just flick to check spots but check corners. I feel like if anything for me campers make the game easier than people who are doing a whole bunch of moving
"Lol what a loser, he could be running around grinding obsidian on that but he chooses to sit there the whole match with the worst mp5 build and stopping power"
My question to Infinity Ward is why even put that spot there?
Wait... I�ve seen you before on cod modern warfare �Shoot the ship� Did you run into someone named Jamin69?? Becuase if so your AX50 and HDR were sooooo annoying
Check corners hehe
Someone sat in the spot that someone is usually sat in? I don't believe it.
"I know right! If only there was a way to look and see if someone was there. Its so unfair, 75% of players are doing it but I check 0% of the time and get upset :("
It�s literally on the playlist right now. Shoot the ship. Honestly this challenge is finicky; sometimes it counts the dusty aftermath of an explosion as �smoke�.
Only you have to be in the smoke. Enemy can be anywhere
"SA 87, Smokes, Restock, Thermal Sight, play domination and just smoke out B and camp that bitch out, youll have it done in a few hours."
"Easy unlock at shipment, pop smoke and shoot to kill."
"Get on right now bro, it�s STS time. 3 more gold weapons for me tonight!"
"Spam smoke grenades, use mega size mag, play Shipment.  Shouldn't take very long.  You could also use a thermal scope, but I found that blindly shooting out of the smoke was pretty effective.  Only you need to be in the smoke."
"I�ve just done this on shoot house, dropped the smoke on myself, got at least half a dozen kills during the round whilst in smoke, probably closer to 7 or 8, and the challenge hasn�t gone up? Are you sure it�s only you who needs to be in the smoke?"
Shipment. Shoot house. Solozero NVG optic. Throw smoke at your feet. ADS. Spray.
Mine just started to work too... finally
"Yeah not sure when they fixed it. It never prompted me to update in game, or on the PlayStation itself. 
Was a nice surprise for sure"
"Finally! Just played a round, got XP as expected"
"Final-FUCKING-ly!

Now if only they could retroactively award us all the XP we missed out on over the course of two weeks.

Fucking hell. At least I don't have to delete the game now."
Oh god no wtf ew get outta here
Awful
If only it wasn�t for tiktok.
Im convinced that people who make these bids have horrible taste in music
"Not sure if you're aware of this or not, however just because people like different music than you doesn't mean their taste is horrible"

I would play 4v4 but livestock is shit
[deleted]
"I like Shipment 24/7 and Shoothouse 24/7 sperated, but I rather to have ""Shoot the Ship"" than some non sense empty lobby playlist."
"Couldn�t agree more. 

Shoothouse is my favourite map, by far, so having a 24/7 playlist of that is great. Shipment is also fun, but I can only be stunned / flashed / gassed / RPG�d off spawn so many times before I don�t want to play anymore, lol."
Livestock 24/7
This right here
"It should be a good one but in the few games I played SBMM didn't work at all. Every game has a domainating player, which is not fun because it wasn't me. Maybe there are too few players in that playlist."
Just be glad it's back. Sheesh.
"I wanted STS... it means I can do all camo challenges including long shots, mounted, hip fire and I can rinse and repeat with about 40-50 kills a round easily."
"reasonable. It's just like me and the boys (and a lot of other people) already have our camos for over half a year now, we just want to play for some fun and gameplay on shoot house is completely different to shipment. I think It doesn't make much sense to put these maps together."
[deleted]
"Of course not, haha.Biggest problem is that they really seem to not support MW anymore. This is sad, so these fuckers could at least bring it in a state to make it permanently playable for ""fans"" without unnecessary playlist changes every week. But they won't even do that bc they want us to buy a new mw next year. They should've construed mw19 as the main game for minimum 2 years...and they should kick out treyarch. They made the two absolutely worst CODs ever in row now"
Scrap the rust shot up ship
Cavebridgecrash the rusty shipyardstockhouse palace
"I like the mix, I play both differently so it keeps it interesting for me"
"The whole map of Verdansk, but its 75vs75"
I think we need not complain too much.. we will end up with shit playlists for 3 months again.
Hi randomn question I�ve never got any gun gold but in a few kills away with my first do you get anything besides the gold came do you get a emblem or calling card for each gun?
"Nah,only the golden skin on the weapon you unlocked it [for.](https://for.You)You can unlock a calling card or emblem separately though.For example in AR's you need 500 kills after gold has been unlocked to get a gold calling card."
"Yes I noticed it was fixed the other day, was unlocking attachments and leveling up normally"
Yep me and my friend both got XP last night. Finally!
Fixed for me as well!
After the playlist update today I�m getting Match XP again. Finally.
I don't see XP for matches accumulate for me.  Match XP and Total XP are same number each time.  meh
C. All of them
"Both games share assets so you can download a pack from one that will help the other. You can also download standalone packs from one for the other.

But you still need to buy the other game in order to play the content of that game. It sounds like you need to buy Cold War if you wanna play campaign"
"Oh damn, I was hoping I had Cold War as well because it let me download all the campaign parts and the zombies parts. That's a bit annoying, but thank you for your answer and your help."
Same
Was this in shoot the ship or all maps?
It was shoot the ship. Too mad to try another mode lol
"The Striker 45, my favourite smg, it�s like the scar, if you can get your headshots down precise you will love it"
"Imma nail those HS's man,thanks!"
"MP5 - Mono Supressor, Merc Foregrip, 10mm rounds, Stippled Grip tape, another attachment dependent on preference.

The MP5 is reliable, but the UZI slaps so try it out. The fennec has ridiculous rate of fire but only good with higher magazine capacity. All smg�s are good but the ISO isn�t great in my opinion, again, with SMG�s it�s dependent on preference rather than which one is better."
"seen alot of ppl on SnD use it,will for sure! thanks"
what about iso and fennec?
"MP5 and AUG (5.56) would be the 2 highest tier SMGs.

MP7 would come a step behind that, but is usually a tad worse than the 2 mentioned above."
Ye i tried aug5.56 right now and its true ngl! thanks
Mp7 if you're playing MW
"Thanks G,what about aug?"
"The Uzi with .41 AE. High DPS at range, no recoil and fast handling."
Thanks dude
This..... I just started leveling up this smg and it melts one of my favorite guns in the game now
People say mp5 but that gun really isn't anything special now. Try thr uzi with 41ae ammo. It's ridiculous
"Bet, thank you!"
Same one that always have been
"AUG with 30 round 556 is honestly my personal favorite, with the .41 AE uzi coming in 2nd. The old king MP5 in both caliber would be a 3rd for me and MP7 follows closely in 4th."
Mp7
MP5
"I love the p90. 

Longest barrel, 

monolithic suppressor, 

stippled grip tape, 

stippled front grip, 

ADS stock.

This is my loadout, and if you�re running scavenger, it�s really good. It has the least recoil out of any gun I�ve ever used, has great range, fast fire rate, and 50 round mags."
"Battle Harderned is for tacticals though

You are looking at EOD (in Perk #1/Blue)"
"Boy can you read? 


BATTLE HARDENED
""Reduce strength of enemy flash, stun, EMP, and gas effects, imune to snapshot grenades"" 

Is there anything about explosions in there???"
Jesus Christ buddy
Lmao I�m sorry but you clearly know how to read judging by your post so why can�t you read the description of the perk
"Wrong perk m8, you're looking for EOD"
Battle hardened doesn't do anything for explosions?
Ya trash post. EOD is what you�re looking for. Perk 1 category.
"Yes, and vice versa. Anything you do will sync as long as the accounts are connected at Activision"
Sweet thanks all I needs know haha
Definitely not lol
"Hasn�t affected my lobbies. Usually get a good mix between 0.3KD lobbies to drenched sweat lobbies, and in between.

Edited cause I can�t type for shit."
The matchmaking dosen't care about your wallet. It matches you in the same lobbies if you buy or not. Will there be people with no attachments there? Obviously. Is it rigged match making? No. Please stop looking for illuminati symbols everywhere.
Wrong sub
....?
I guess it's a cold war item so you can equip it only on cw operator
Unfortunately that is the case.
"I'm thinking that you're talking about the watch in the free battlepass, well that watch is only available in Warzone and Cold War. Doesn't let you have it in MW. It's a shame"
"I find this odd, I bought the Gilded Age bundle on warzone and apart from the watch only, the rest of the things (blue print etc) are usable on mw."
Since when was an arm or leg shot a one hit kill? Maybe they did nerf it and I've never noticed because I wouldn't expect to get a kill with anything other than a chest/headshot.
It has always been like this. Consider adding attachments to increase the bullet velocity.
"Or just use fury bolts. You get hitmarker, but you like it... Cuz after that, you hear someone blowing up. Lol"
Maybe I've just never noticed. I've been using the croosbow consistently for the past few months but recently I've been getting a lot of hitmarkers
Aim higher. It's always been OHK to upper body only with full health.
I guess I never noticed. I've been using the crossbow pretty consistently over the past few months but I it's only been recently when I started getting hitmarkers. I just assumed it was OHK this entire time because I never used to get hitmarkers with it
It�s always been like that for me unless I used the explosive or thermite bolts.
"[here](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeNudPk2/) 

If you want, I can actually save the video without the tik tok icon floating around and sent that"
"My man!!! Come through in a clutch!

That would be awesome if you could do that!"
"2 things you got and they�re called eyes, should help in those situations"
You beat me to it lol
"have you ever thought about trying to be helpful? and not be a bitch to someone that's trying to get better at the game? nobody asked for that stupid opinion of yours and nobody asked or wanted you to participate in that manner. i asked if someone has a way to train their glint spotting skills. if you don't have a way, don't participate. I bet you're the kid in class that used to always respond with ""not me"" to a question the teacher asked. you're not being helpful and just wasting oxygen and water. get the fuck out of this community you filthy piece of unwanted trash."
Your brain matches the glint with loosing when you get domed so playing the game instead of loosing your time looking for an easy way on reddit would actually work better.
"i wish i could use your brain to reference something in your everyday life with losing or something negative. but i really can't. you don't have a brain. you could've been helpful and make a guy that just wants to get better at the game, win more and die less... but i guess that you just had to to write that stupid comment and not help anyone or yourself. I bet if one of your siblings needed help with something you'd just say:"" gut gud"" without doing anything useful. fucking idiot."
Just keep playing more and more and you�ll get better
Captured by a potato.
Thanks lol
Yeah I havent been able to do any mara operator missions either. But wasnt sure if it was because I only have a store bought skin not the default one.
I have the default one but it won't let me do these ones
I can't do any of those missions

**What's up with the Fatal Freeze?  It's unreleased?**

The Fatal Freeze is a strange one, as it was advertised and promoted by Sony's official Twitter ([here](https://twitter.com/playstation/status/1252681006433394689?lang=en)), even featuring a nifty video, but there were no details on how to unlock it.

Unlike other PS4-exclusive Blueprints, there do not appear to have been any Missions that would have unlocked it.

The game's official website even has placeholder language for the weapon (""showcase weapon traits), instead of detailing the name of the Challenge Mission that would unlock the Fatal Freeze: [https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare/ps4](https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare/ps4)

Indeed, Googling the Fatal Freeze just turns up more posts asking about its lack of availability.

**Wasn't all of this content advertised as being PS4 exclusive?**

Yes, but as a ***timed***\-exclusive - much like Survival mode, which *was released* to Xbox/PC on 10/1/20.  Inconsistently, however, these Missions/Blueprints and Combat Packs were not released to Xbox/PC.  If you need official examples of the timed-exclusive language, here ya go ([1](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/02/10/modern-warfare-season-two-starts-tomorrow-including-new-ps4-exclusive-content/) / [2](https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare/ps4) / [3](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/28/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-season-six-adds-a-fast-travel-subway-system/)).  I can dig up plenty more.

**When did the exclusivity period end?**

Most were advertised to end on 10/1/20.  The exclusivity on some of the Season 6 content was advertised to end on 12/1/20.

**Well those are the earliest dates the content** ***could be*** **made available.  No promise that it would be made available by a certain date.**

Absolutely true.  The whole point of this post is to raise visibility and ask IW/ATI to release this content, as they did with Survival mode, as the exclusivity period has expired months ago.

**If you care so much, just unlock the content on PS4 and then link Xbox/PC to the same account.**

Tried that.  Unfortunately only some of the content displays properly - most likely due to being Warzone loot drops.  Interesting, though, is that ""Lock and Stock"" for Otter did not display properly *until* a couple months ago, so it could be a good sign they're working on it.

**Those calling cards are rewards from past Gunfight Tournaments.  They won't be made available again.**

Not so fast.  Many signs point to past ""exclusive"" content being made available again.  For example, there have been at least [11 leaked bundles](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles?q=battle%20pass%20season) of past Battle Pass content, plus previous BP Operator missions have been displaying, which could indicate their return to the game for those who missed out the first time.  This would suggest they're open-minded to making past ""exclusive"" content available again.  Plus it's been a year since those calling cards were rewards.  Any ""clout"" from having them has since worn off, and, as a general principle, it would be great to make all past content available again somehow.

**Who cares?!  It's just cosmetics.**

Yep, and cosmetics comprised $1.2 billion of the company's $1.9b in revenue in 3 months time:  [https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-made-dollar12b-in-microtransactions-in-the-last-quarter/](https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-made-dollar12b-in-microtransactions-in-the-last-quarter/)   They're obviously important to many people, as the entire value proposition of the Battle Pass, bundles, and all DLC centers around cosmetics.

**When do you think this content will come out?**

Maybe never.  But I'd like to think more optimistically, as I do know ATI/IW listen to our feedback and try to help us out where they can.  Given that Warzone's one-year anniversary is coming up in a few weeks, March 2021 could be a great time to add this content in for everyone!

cc: u/artpeasant u/dmickner u/ashtonisVULCAN_IW"
Agreed!
Imagine still worrying about this game and bot cold war
The two calling cards were rewards for gunfight tourny's and not exclusives
"Correct, addressed this in my FAQs comment.  They were exclusive to GF tourney."
"I just want sufferings end and the far right combat pack at this point, and maybe that magnum in the Wyatt combat pack"
Suffering's End is awesome!  Mainly black paint but has some nice blue touches.  Hopefully this stuff will become available next month.
"Great post, would love for all of this to be in the game! Sadly no one at IW cares about this sub since July, unlucky!"
"Thanks man.  Joel actually responds quite a bit and helped us get some awesome bundles to rotate back in a few weeks ago.  I think they�re listening, they just can�t reply to everything.  Fingers crossed!! /u/artpeasant"
"Yes! exactly, Good thinking"
<3
Activision: I don�t want your money.
It doesn't help that we can't select what mission we can do. It's not like they removed the ability to choose a mission.
"You can still choose your Core MP mission, but yes, unbelievably they did remove the ability to choose your Warzone mission.  Who knows maybe it's due to these additional missions being added for everyone."
Was there ever a promise to release this? I always assumed they were exclusives you could only get on one system during the timed period then it would be inaccessible forever.
That�s literally the opposite of what a timed exclusive means.  Check out the FAQs I included.   Same goes for Survival mode.
"""Timed exclusive"" means exclusive for a limited time, then accessible to everybody, not ""Only available for X platform for Y amount of time, then never again"".

For example, map packs and betas for older games in the series (*Black Ops* to *Advanced Warfare*) were a one-month timed exclusive for Xbox, then later (*Black Ops III* to present) for PlayStation. After that period, they released for the other platforms"
"Even the official PS4 blog explicitly shows that the weapons are only exclusive until Oct 1st 2020 

[https://blog.playstation.com/2020/02/10/modern-warfare-season-two-starts-tomorrow-including-new-ps4-exclusive-content/](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/02/10/modern-warfare-season-two-starts-tomorrow-including-new-ps4-exclusive-content/)"
it looks a lot like the nikto bundle so maybe thats why?
"Thin Ice and Cold Drift are nearly identical but both were released, so no, I don�t think that�s why."
I doubt they�ll release it! They�re trying to get people to play black ops.
"Eh we�ve already seen much leaked new content for MW, so adding this older stuff to Xbox and PC doesn�t seem impossible"
"I'm still waiting on a chance to get the ""Grand Rapids"" blueprint on PC. I want that stubby suppressed barrel mod."
"If you can get on PS4, you can unlock it there and have it sync back to PC.  It displays properly since it�s WZ loot."
Someone tag activision
Omfg thank god it's not just me this is has been pissing me off loads
Are you using a storebougjt skin for mara
"Same thing happening to me, no progress"
same issue with d-days challenges. sometimes they just break and I don't know if they'll address it anymore. doubt it
"It's really simple, if you were there at the beginning of season one and got the battle pass and completed it. You'll get the skins, the bug is actually you seeing you got the mara challenges, but you won't earn them"
I thought this aswell . . I bought season 1 BP at that time but I did not finish to BP level 100. . . I was hoping they would have opened it up for another chance to earn it again.
Bruh how do u get gunbutt kills to unlock the amax
Oh that's the challenge for it? Run the Breacher muzzle thing on your guns and it will 1 hit them
Same. XSX
Try joining the same regimenr
It's back up and working for me know. just showed up.
Okay same here! Thank god
"This is happening for me, my brother, and all my friends. I'm on pc, and everyone else is on ps4 or xbox, none of us are showing up for anyone. We can't join eachother, our recently met tabs are all empty as well. I even tried whispering my friends with /w to try and join off their name in the chatbox, but that didn't work either. Classic MW with garbage party/social systems"
I hard reset my Xbox and it worked when it happened to me.
"Ill try that again in a sec, maybe it'll work now that i've redownloaded the game"
I�ve seen a lot of people with this problem. Specifically on consoles. Don�t think I�ve ever seen someone with a solution though unfortunately. Good luck.
Yeah it's really upsetting tbh. I appreciate it though
I had to delete the game and re install fresh from disc
"This could maybe be it, I installed it through my ""already owned games"" library and not just by selecting the game that's in the disk drive. Did you do anything else specific when downloading it?"
"It happened to me when i bought MW. I had installed warzone before and when i would put in the disc it would just say purchase the game. I had to uninstall and reinstall which was brutal given how long it takes to download all the files, but after that it was working fine!"
Also is AUG still a good gun?
In hardcore
Same for me I�m rank 225 and still have the private icon.
"What they�re doing now is what killed the BO2 hype. People want money. Where there�s a customer base, there�s money. They think they can glitch it enough to have people buy the new games, but it�s not going to work with how everything is right mow"
"I�m completely uninterested in regular multiplayer since it�s just shoot and kill without any real strategy, which is why I like warzone but at this rate I might just switch to TARKOV"
Tinfoil hat time.
"You�re not the only one, having the same issue"
Good. Everything fails to load when you log in right?
Yeah it�s broken
Same stuck to n loading screen I deleted it now
It�s starting to piss me off
Ya it�s fucked yo on the app can�t see my ps4 or Xbox stats lol
Maybe update for cartoon war.
"Just when you think this game couldn�t get anymore fucked... seriously are they trying to kill this game?

Edit: same thing happened to me (ps4)"
"They are not gone, servers are bugged atm and friend list is just not working, like the xp"
It's back up and working for me know. just showed up.
"If you're in the same regiment, you can invite them to a game(it still a bit finicky, sometimes they still show up offline). that's how I got it to work as I can only see blizzard client friends(tried this with xbox and ps4 friends)"
Yeppers
Yeah it�s bugged for everyone
It�s cod what do you expect?
Sounds like you got hacked. You�ll want to fill out the account recovery form.
The account recovery form didn't really seem to cover that

"Hold up, shoot the ship is back???"
Yes
Lemme know if you actually get a game of Shipment. After multiple games they�ve all been Shoothouse except for one.
Not sure if this might be a platform issue but on PC the XP issue was fixed last week
On PS4 we haven�t gotten player experience in 2 weeks.. gun xp works sort of.
"I think the player XP issue seems to be only affecting PS players (I could be wrong, but all the clips I see on other platforms have the XP numbers pop up on kills)"
"i was playing on pc earlier today as well i was getting XP for leveling up as well as gun XP, but my 2 friends i was playing with they are on PS4, they are not receiving any XP"
On ps4 playin sts all morning and its leveling up my bp no prob just at a snails pace. Playin hc sts.  im at prestige 1 and the xp blue ring is progressing.
I�ll check again after a restart but my shit hasn�t been working.
"I�m prestige 5, and I know the icon shows 1st prestige for everyone regardless of level, but when I check the scoreboard I have level 0 private icon even though I�m 225. I don�t see anyone else with this problem."
I have that problem too
Yea still no XP for me right now so I just play war zone (PS4)
No xp or gun progress for me still
I get it sometimes.. it doesn�t make senae
Wait you ain�t got no xp??
Sometimes I do sometimes I don�t.
"xp seems fixed as of right now. (ps4) only problem i'm having is bots for teammates. no one is getting on the point, but rather die sitting on the wall on shoot house or in shipment, casually camp by dumpster or forklift."
"I don't play Cold War so experience in MW is meaningless to me.

I hope that insight helps some people cope with this  :)"
"I wasn�t getting gun xp for almost 2 weeks so that was kind of a deal breaker, my xp has seemed to come back tho"
I've been getting xp no problem?
"Just got XP. Maybe it was fixed today? I don�t remember getting XP yesterday 

I played HC Demolition on Shipment and earned 13k

https://i.imgur.com/0ohhNA1.jpg"
I just did a match and got xp so maybe it�s fixed
Just shut up and enjoy the maps.  Fuckin a.
[removed]
"I played for 2 hours earlier and seemed to be getting 2x xp somehow, all STS on ps4. I had my system fully off before playing, not rest mode"
Wow
"Classic ""when you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" scenario."
Imposter!!!
"I personally run restock, thermites, frag mag Jak 12 and usually an RPG to deal with this shit, but each to their own"
A dragunov happened?
Maybe he leveled up and unlocked the as Val and well as the dragunov
"Mate. You could�ve specified what is different, I can�t see anything wrong"
"Both weapons have the attachments slots missing. AS Val has only three out of five. 

Hope that helps."
"Some of the customization slots aren't there because you need to level your guns up higher, after doing so some of the slots will appear. I see that you are on level 1 with both of these, so after levelling up the guns higher it will unlock more slots. Not a bug, was always like this."
"Just happened to me as well, on top of having to re-download 4 data packs (PS5) when my game froze just earlier. I am so fucking mad! Activision what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"Okay, thought I was the only one. I�m on PC and all my friends are not appearing besides the two friends I have added through Battlenet. Yeah this is weird. Hate to speak like this since I�m no coder/developer but Activision... get your shxt together."
"Yep, I'm on XBox and can't see PS friends"
Same. PC
"glad it�s not just me, pc aswell"
Same for me on playstation and I contacted one of my friends on snapchat and she is on xbox and it's the same. We can't even add each other with the unique IDs. It's an Activision problem
Same on pc trying to play cross platform...im on the west coast but my friends on xbox can play together..
Im also experiencing this on xbox. Fuck
"yoo, how did you fix the game crashing? i�m having a problem."
"lemme look again how i did it lol, i�ll get back to u"
Fuck activision
Xbox had a small update today. Maybe they messed up some code to where now we can play cross platform or even see our cross platform friends?...
Cant* play
There�s another thread going on [click](https://reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lmvvg9/lost_my_friends_list_what/)
Dude I'm playing on pc and my buddy who is on xbox was able to see me and join me but i couldnt hear him but saw that he was in my party. I then tried to send him a friend request and it said sent but he never got it. But i was not able see him on my friends list or anyone else on my friends list. so whatever this fucking issue is needs to get fixed. A$AP Rocky style.
It was as of an hour ago
Add your friends to regiment and send a friend request to them. After that invite him to your party... Hope it works for all of you like it did for us...
well I had tons of friends and don�t remember most of their spelling in their names some even had fancy fonts
I can't even see friends in the mobile app
This is happening to me and now when I try to update the game I keep getting an error when scanning files and I have no clue what I'm meant to do.

What�s wrong with it?
How you're supposed to complete it with an unreleased gun maybe?
"ITS A VISUAL GLITCH, IT IS MEANT TO SAY WITH THE RENETTI NOT THE SYKOV."
Is that not obvious?
"So they added in shoot the ship again, buuuut broke weapon xp.     Again?"
Yes.. The whole MW MP seems to be broken exp wise. Warzone is working normal..

�Cold War bad MW good� post #828288473729929
"Can't have your cake and eat it, I guess.."
"Weapon xp work just fine, it's the regular xp that is not working. The only xp you are going to get after a match is from completed challenges. You'll get your regular xp some times, but more than 75% of the time you wont"
Raven has nothing to do with modern warfare tho...you�re calling out the wrong developer.
"It's been in the news stories that Raven took over MW 2019 now. IW is working on something else, next MW?  But they are officially maintaining MW 2019 now.  So it was their ""FuckUpdate"" that broke  the game a few weeks back.  I'm now suspecting it's related to the code pool shared with WZ and/or the don't care your game is toast soon attitude."
These guys contort themselves into a pretzel trying to deflect the blame from Infinity Ward
I�m quite sure they do sir.
"Companies like these just care about investors and profits by any means necessary. We are watching them ride this horse into ground, right before it�s legs give out they will all abandon ship. 

Battlefield 6 will likely end CoD later this year when it releases. It�s going to be modern which seems to be the most popular time setting in first person shooters dealing with realist fighting. For example MW 2019 was the most profitable Call of Duty title ever made. Battlefield 3 was also the most profitable Battlefield title ever made as well. 

With CoD going back to older wars, the creativity is limited along with many other things that just don�t resonate as well as modern warfare based games."
"Battlefield won't even put a dent on CoD or its real playerbase, the games play completely different. CoD doesn't have any real competition atm, not sure if it ever had, but it could use some

Agreed on all the other stuff though"
"seen this same comment since 2011 bro, cod not gonna end anytime soon"
"I know we would like to see them suffer for their incompetence, but they won�t. Each year a new cod will be released and millions and millions of players will LOVE every game. Sure not everyone likes every call of duty, but enough people like every game that they continue to sell crazy amounts of copies.

A lot of people hate CW, but I prefer CW to MW and there�s tens of millions of players who would agree with me"
"Exactly, what an absolute joke."
"Im seriously annoyed, cutting out a season�s worth of content like soap and three weapons, breaking XP and weapon XP AND HITMARKERS?! only to fix it for a while and then break it again when shoot the ship comes back? Honestly, the slap in the face they gave to devoted fans of this game is actually painful to see. Im heavily tempted to get as many of my friends that play CW as possible to play MW exclusively for a week straight as a form of protest to the crap. Or better yet, delete MW and never play CoD again as a form of boycott."
Cold War multiplayer is way better then mw less campers all players in mw do is just camp even in the smallest maps
It honestly seems like MW is becoming CW in terms of buggyness(?)
Weapon xp seems fine to me
"I finally finished the campaign and the outro title screen pegged a big fat effing WARZONE in the middle of Modern Warfare. What a fucking middle finger to the consumer. Like no, I just finished playing MW, an amazing game. Not your war zone CW shit"
I guess you like dying to campers 24/7 in mw
The only way to beat a shotgun is to use a shotgun
AK-47 all day every day
M4 cause I'm old school
Scar will always be my favourite gun
I use either a sniper/ kar (those type of guns) on hardcore coz it�s fun or in core the katanas coz it�s actually rlly fun But can be annoying on some maps

Did you notice anything with his face?
Probably the weapon drop and got very lucky with it
Oh... I forgot those existed
"Theres stuff you can do to use the gun in multiplayer, just not common. Also, does anyone know where i can get help for cod point bugs?"
Didn't they update the game for that two or three days ago?
Wait I have never seen the raal before only the cx9 and sykov what does the raal look like
it looks like a buffer m91
Take a look at here: [https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/weapons/1128-raal-mg](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/weapons/1128-raal-mg)
Same. Looks like its happening to everyone right now.
"Thanks, glad it�s not me cuz I have other bs going on and was about to have a meltdown lmao."
"oh my gosh, glad it�s not just me. hopefully they fix this"
Same for me XSX
"I fucking hate Activision so fucking much. I don't know who they get to program this horrible fucking game but these fucking incompetent morons need to be replaced with someone who can actually string two fucking lines of code together.

Goddamn."
"Get Ninja in there as a Perk 2. You would have to make the Choice between Overkill, Ghost or Ninja. It would certainly make it more interesting and UAV's would be worth more."
"That's what I'm thinking. It would also make you choose between it, restock and high alert. All the really good perks are in slot 2 and I think that's a good thing."
"I was thinking up of 2 more perks to even out the number of perks by adding one, as perk 3 I think a similar version of the gunfighter wildcard from That other CoD game, adds only 1 extra attachment slot but also applies to secondaries and Overkill primaries, though it might not save with custom blueprints, unless the weapon drop can add that saved 6th attachment when you chose an attachment without the perk, makes the weapon drop more useful 

For slot one I�m thinking maybe steady aim from cod4 which improves hip fire accuracy but seems redundant with the laser attachments unless it has other features"
I�m on board with this. Crazy to think that dead silence used to be a permanent perk in older COD�s.
"right? And it wasn't even that long ago, either! It feels like it's always been this way, though."
Infinite Warfare had a similar mechanic. The Tracker perk would neutralize Dead Silence.
"I'm all for this. A quieter but not completely silent perk for footsteps would be amazing. A perk being modified to counter it would also be good. 

Dead Silence should remain, like you said. I just think it's too fun to get rid of, especially with the speed boost, FOV boost, and kill chaining."
"I didn't know it actually gave you a speed boost, I thought it just increased your FOV. I was unaware of the extra perks it gave! I just liked it for its ability to keep you completely silent."
Love the m13 but sometimes becomes hitmarker machine
What did you do for the aim training exactly ?
I practiced on regular bots on small maps like shipment or speedball. I also experiment with different guns and class setups to see which ones have the lowest recoil. Basically what [this guy](https://youtu.be/LWz0oeWT1cQ) does but worse cause I�m on console
Mines still fucked up. Only from afar tho or super close.
"I've been having the same problem for days, since they wiped all the cheaters its been doing this. It makes me so mad that I pay to play this CoD and can't even do that, its frustrated me to the point of not playing it anymore. Which sucks because I do love to play this game more than any other title I own."
"Yeah it�s a massive pain in the ass, me and my gf love to play CoD together but 95% of the time it kicks us off of every game we try to play. It�s such a shame really"
"It's a bug, you shouldn't have seen it as it is only for people who bought the season 1 bp."
"Ahhh, ok. Welp, that�s a bummer, but good to know. I got the game late - I think it was season 6 when I finally got it, but it showing up after the recent update made me think it was just some new goodies. Appreciate the info!"
I dont think the operator challenges are meant to be around anymore so they just dont work
"Thats weird because they weren�t around before the most recent update, and now they are, but don�t track and aren�t selectable."
"I�ve encountered this exact problem probably a week ago, made a video and sent it to activision support on Twitter, last I heard from them is 5 days ago saying it�s sent to the team and they will take a look at it. Maybe you should tweet at activision support too saying that you are encountering the same problem, [here�s my tweet](https://twitter.com/notseawang/status/1358665120285487106?s=21). I also posted the video in this subreddit too [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lf69sh/whenever_i_try_to_favorite_a_bocw_s1_emblem_in_mw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), and its also happening to calling cards and I�ve noticed that bugged emblem and callings cards are all from BOCW s1 battle pass."
Where was she lol
Lying on the ground i had to pause the vid lol
Its clips like these that make me miss that one sight from ghost that put an orange border around your enemies when you ADS
"To get platinum, you need the first 3 snipers golden too.

Edit: that�s what I�m going for at the moment too, since I just need the AX-50 and Kar-98 gold for snipers."
"Yep that threw me off too, got all the Marksmen then gotta get Snipers too.  BUT shoot the ship is baaaaaccccckkkkk!!"
"To get plat for snipers you need the dragunov, ax50, hdr, mk2 carbine, kar98k and ebr. The spr has nothing to do with it, the spr gets platinum automatically when you unlock gold if you have platinum already unlocked, but the gun doesn�t count towards platinum progression."
[here�s a helpful link for Damascus ](https://damascus.now.sh). You have to do marksman and snipers as a group for platinum in those two categories.
"Almost like you wasted your time grinding for arbitrary camos when they don't effect gameplay whatsoever.

Almost like you should have just enjoyed playing the game?"
....nothing in that meant i was not enjoying the game as well
Thank you. What did these people do before cosmetics in video games? Just not play them?
Already got Damascus!! HAHA Should of grinded earlier!! LOL
"For everyone saying that ""Its Warzone, not MW"", he means the MW story

Idk but seeing Price (the only MW character that has appeared during the whole trailer) and bunker 10 and the nuke again seems a bit suspicious"
This
Sorry to break it to you but it�s for warzone
That�s just warzone.
But it�s still mw content in a Cold War trailer
Is that a CX-9 in Price's hands in the third picture?
No it�s the Kilo
Because warzone. They already showed a road map for season 2. Nothing for modern warfare.
battle tested kilo
Is shoot the ship a thing at this moment?
"Mw experience is broken.. still, no player or battle pass experience is being given."
"At the moment, in multiplayer, the XP is not working properly. I think game xp and battle xp are linked together so if you don't earn match xp, you won't get anything for the pass (I am pretty sure it works like that)"
"I know, it's taking ages. It was easy completing all the levels in MW's season 6. BOCW's Season 1's levels are so sloooow"
You're supposed to buy the levels dumb dumb
"I don�t know how to feel about this, but you sure do got a lot of drawing skills"
"I have no strong opinions on this pairing. Its a blunder how i came to it at all 
But thank you"
I think you may be onto something. I like this. Keep up the good work
Yo Dax have you ever thought about drawing Minotaur going through the grieving period when he thought Bale was KIA? Just an idea.
"Ive done sketches of him fighting thai police lmao 
The closest to whatnu suggested so far. Maybe one day"
yoo nananananana fuck dat it's lerch x velikan not this bs
Ayoooo?
Dam u right fam how could i have not realized this sooner
In the new trailer there were pictures from modern warfare so maybe
Could you possibly link that trailer or was it just the one that was in the jungle with them in the helicopter.
Th challenge for the RAAl is not tracking. What a  surprise.
I�ve kinda assumed that�s just because MW is broken in tracking XP and shit right now lol
Don't we have enough weapons?!?!?!?
There can never be too many weapons

"No need for testing. Let's just imagin this against a dragon breath shotgun


1-if you shoot first with a one shot weapon you will win the fight. This set up isn't optimal to start with.

2-the dragon breath dude will see your laser and shoot you first. Dragon breath wins.

3-as good as the M4 is, you need a few bullet in the dude to kill him. Dragon breath wins.

4- if you didn't have overkill you could have ghost, which means UAV's don't spot you. If you are on the minimap dragon breath wins.

5- no silencers mean the dude will hear you coming if you drop a single bullet. Dragon breath wins.

6- when you have heart beat sensor in your hands you don't have a gun. Dragon breath wins.

7- disableing only works if you shoot the legs...dont shoot the legs. This is a whole other attachment you could use to hit more shots or move faster which could help you win against a dragon breath.

8- you have a shotgun secondary and an underbarel shotgun. Thats just waste. Your M4 has to be the worst class ive ever seen.

Now is this set up better than running a dragon breath? I mean there is more range so yes. You are more versatile. In close range situations? You could still use the broken weapon to sweat people better. But do you want to be that guy?"
ok thx i will make a new counter then thx for your true facts and feedback
I think someone in your house is watching brazzers 4k
Just don't understand why it is not permanent playlist. Just give it to us IW
Facts
"It's never available at the start of a new season, my guess is that they don't want people blasting through the battle pass at the start, and try to discourage people from buying tiers."
ah shit here we go again
Lets go. Just in time for me starting on my launchers.
"Pro tip: you don't have to shoot people with the rockets to get kills, you can just melee them with it in hardcore. Makes getting attacker and defender kills with the jokr a thousand times easier

And hardcore anything is good because more people use counter uavs and personal radars, which count as ground streaks, airstreaks and support streaks"
all i have left is like 10% if the dragunov and quite a bit of the hdr so it�s come back around a bit late for me but i�m not complaining lol
"I can now get my sticks gold.. I love the sticks, also wanna get the uzi done, and maybe the ax50 depending how much I get to play."
the sticks are actually quite alright to use even on the other maps (i mostly play hc though). but yeah i�m surprised that they added it back in already after what like 2 weeks?
Get gold riot shielf
Wait whaaaat? I can finally try to get the riot shield done :D
Looks like meat is back on the menu boys!!!
You mean shoot house with a dash of shipment is back?
[deleted]
"i finally plan on grinding for damascus, any tips lol?"
Tip from me is don't. It just fucking sucks.
Hardcore
"From experience, do the most annoying ones first like the launchers and the riot shield. I�d probably also go for the shotguns as the point blank kills are more difficult on the longer range maps. Save the snipers last imo as they are okay to do in ground war"
"Bravo six, going to die 50 times"
"Yo sick! I was taking a break for a bit, did they fix weapon xp yet or not?"
yeah it�s fixed :)
Is xp fixed?
Player XP still broken
Friends list is not working??? No one online for me
Same here
fuck yeah
Let's! Fucking! Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
All my friends vanished
Yaba Daba Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Ope time to re-download multi-player again
"Honestly I�m pretty sure Activision doesn�t want Shoot the Ship as a permanent playlist, it�s easily the most popular playlist in MW and more people playing MW means less in Cold War."
Good!
obsidian swords and sticks here i come !!
FUCK YES!!!! But did they remove onslaught? If so then FUCK!!!!
"As far as I can see unfortunately for you, they did remove onslaught"
"I mean... Isn't that how the objective is played?

I'm always baffled when people on demolition come at me for camping a bomb... When my objective is literally to defend it"
"Same thing with search it�s like, you plant a bomb and defend it and people are like..... you�re camping!!!!! Like that�s the whole point of the game...."
not talking abt demolition
"Bro I hear peeps screaming at me if I just stop to reload, Camper, camper, camper... yeah right.  I have a Mute button and I'm not afraid to use it! ;-)"
"As a ctf player I never understood why in Team Defender you permanently stay on the map with the flag. 
You gotta blame the devs for the way people play it. They know they show on the map so they use a shield to hide in corners.

Also, they should just take the score limit off as well as change it entirely. You should only get points from kills with the flag"
exactly they either need to fix it or take it out of the shuffle completely
Ik fuck team defender camper fest
exactly
"Try using different weapons and lethals.  You know launchers, thermite, Semtex, molotovs, thermite and explosive tipped crossbow.  
It�s not a problem and actually makes the game a bit more fun."
i do but that doesn�t stop the fact that ppl camp red crate wit riot sheilds
Anyone who doesn�t love Team Defender on any map shouldn�t be playing this game.
Agreed
because of an opinion? alr
Well it says Cold War and Warzone....raven doesn�t do mw updates.
"I�ve been saying this for a hot minute and people keep bashing me but... I seriously feel like any content that was planned for this game has been scrapped and will not be added, it will be utilized in the next game."
At this point you are speaking the truth
No you'd re wrong. They stated from the begining 6 seasons for MW . After that it's on to the next one.
Rule number 1 for gaming leaks: It's probably not true until it's true.
Big if true
Big if true
They aren�t making content because they are working on the sequel.
"Well the cx9 and sykov are done so the are probably gonna come secretly into maiden warfare, and activision isn�t saying anything about it cause they want to keep all the attention on coldwar and warzone a bit too cause those are the newest things"
Well duh. They aren't adding content to MW anymore. Only Warzone and Cold War
Cold War doesn't have gun game???
There�s nothing in the files that indicates when content is released. The so called leakers saying otherwise are taking you guys for a ride while they fuel their click bait videos. They keep moving the goal post.
"Like someone said, totally are garbage."
LMAO one 6v6 map what a piece of shit waste of time/money shit war is
that one map is better than all of modern campfare 2019 maps
tbh i wouldnt get your hopes up too high. i doubt they are gonna release any mw content until season 3 or even later. i wouldn�t even be shocked if we didn�t get any new mw content until after season 6 :/
Correct me if I�m wrong but aren�t those three maps on the left new for mw?
They�re all for Cold War
Had to repost as it was removed
"great editing, surprised not more upvotes"
"Thanks, man! First time using the editing software. Didn't really know what I was doing but I'm glad it came out good!"
A+ comedic timing!
Yea you die a  lot ... until you get better.  I quit playing a few times when I started that mode. Once I got better it's the only mode I play unless there's a fun new playlist in Core.  Because THEY do too if you shoot them in the toe!  LOL
"HC is good, just not HC free for all."
everyone be camping in hc
It do be like that
Yo I gotta find that mix of that BIG song
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Y2qIS78II) you go
I just go on a suicide spree. They can't kill me if I'm already dead.
This brightness level Is terrible
"This ain't Halo, get moving soldier!"
Lol
Exact same thing happened with me in Cold War on nuketown I was in the room of the yellow house and I kicked two campers in the balls (swift kick finishing move) and they didn�t see me
Bots
You lost me at the teabag
"Yeah, I know that�s kind of unsportsmanship like, but if that happens to you I feel like you deserve it."
Obviously because of your finishing move.
No comms on the other team. You still trash tho.
I play modern warfare on: drugs
Dude I get barbecued and play search and destroy and treat it like a horror game.
I mean that wasn't an option but yeah xD
You could say CoD lobbies don�t stand a chance against my speed at the game. ;)
"PC, Controller (Xbox Elite 2) 

I�d swap over to M&K but I�m just not good enough with it yet."
Xbox one/Series X
Xbox series x and ps4
At the same time?
I play on ps5 and the 2 high texture pack makes the game look so amazing wish we could see a ps5 version of the game though
I am the minority :D PC with PS4 Controller
SHIPPMENTTTTT LETTSSS GOOOOO
Just finished Damascus yesterday lol but I�m not complaining
Lol can�t play it cause it keeps scrolling left and right when I �join a lobby� then kicks me out
Stir crazy is such an underrated gamemode. love it on scrapyard and rammaza
Those are in the 10v10 map list anyway.  The biggest thing is having modes like hardpoint on those maps.
What�s stir crazy?
"Scrapyard and Rammaza is already on 10v10 moshpit so you could play those every day. Most 6v6 maps are on it, so this playlist isn't that much different. 

Still it's a nice change to play 10v10 on the few maps that aren't on the normal playlist so I like it as well."
"It's great but 10v10 on the normal playlist actually includes 6v6 maps like rammaza, atlas, gun runner, scrapyard etc"
Did they fix the XP issue as well?
"Nope, played a game and still got 0 player xp"
"In some games I get xp and some I don't get at all. I think if u do missions that give xp then u gonna get, otherwise nah"
"Yes, Raven [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RavenSoftware/status/1360257492383637507) about an update that rolled out last week.

Some user were still reporting issues, but it should be resolved for most."
"For some it's fixed, for other it ain't. It works fine for me"
"Only for weapons, and that XP does not go to me, just the weapon. On occasion I get match XP but i can go quite a few games before it shows up and I stop getting any.

At least for me, player XP is not working at all, but I have the luxury of being in prestige, I can imagine someone trying to get through 1-55 being extra pissed."
Nooooo
Why remove STS when they�re gonna bring it back after 2 weeks
Bipolar
The fervor has died down on the new Zombies map.
So that cold war doesn't have empty lobbies. This is the same reason they don't remove nukehouse
"Did they get rid of warzone rumble?! 


No funny Valentine�s Day pun, no game mode for us"
Yes
They did it. Those crazy sons of bitches really did it.
Asketh the Lordeth and you shall receiveth.
Stir Crazy is lowkey better than Shoot the Ship
Stir Crazy has always been awesome. 10v10 in general is very underrated
Still no XP fix�.sigh
Works here on ps4 for me right now
yeah shoot the ship is cool and all... but stir crazy is where its at
"A man of culture

10v10 moshpit is also great fun"
A shame they removed Warzone rumble after not having it for so long :( even shipment/shoot house can�t fix the heartbreak
1000% agreed.  Same with Onslaught in multiplayer.
I think shipment is a joy.  It started out as a hated map in MW2 for me but now I love it. Forget grinding. It�s just fun on domination and hard point.
COD4 not mw2
Shipment isnt in MW2
Is the XP bug fixed in MP?
Nah
Stir crazy is pretty fun too
1v1 lets goooooo
More excited for that than STS
THANKS!
Finally I can stop playing coldwar for a week and play mw
"Sad to see snipes go.    


Shoot = Yes Ship = No. (for me)  :)"
That map with the storage containers? Yeaaaah the kids love that one!
"Maybe they will leave it this time, doubt it tho."
I think they remove STS when cold war gets content
my joy fulfills sniper gunfight when shoot the ship isn't around
About time
Holy shit shoot the ship again was unexpected
fuck yeah
Is aim assist on ps4 fixed? I made 3 posts today about this nine of them seem to show up
"My game crashes without error everytime I go to the loadouts... Does anyone else have the same problem?
It's only MW not in warzone"
This is cool and all but where the hell did all my Activision friends go I lost EVERY crossplay friend and kept all my xbox friends. Somebody want to explain this?
Jokr is so hard to do. any tips except playing shipment or hardcore?
"Leveling or camo challenges?  
I did my launchers passively, you always have a launcher equipped as a secondary while you work on other wepons. As soon as a streak comes up, you shoot it down. The ground streaks camo challenge takes a while. You should do amped/attacker/objective kills all together while playing domination on shipment."
"Shoothouse you can jokr down mid from shanty town spawn to the other spawn. Peek, lock, step back to finish lock on. 

For other maps play domination and keep shooting B"
Yay but all my friends are gone.....
Great thanks for STS. It's going to be great since the xp still isn't fixed. (I know it has for some but me and all the people I play with on ps5 it's still broken).
Reinforce is gone again?!? Bro that is one of the best game modes and they keep taking it away from me.
"As some one who hasn�t earned weapon XP or normal XP in about a month, I�m sadly not that excited"
Hot fix for aim assist on PS4 too?
"RIP reinforce. You will be missed

One day I'll try hosting private games of it. I love reinforce. 

IMO this game should rotate all modes on maybe a 4 week cycle. That'd be nice"
The XP bug seems to be gone too! My XP suddenly started working again on Shipment!!
"I'm so happy right now, SHOOT THE SHIIIIIP! WHOOOOO"
Anyone else wishing �I have Rust issues� would come back.
Spent an entire day grinding the Damascus Ram in HC Dom last week.. all the while wishing STS was available... aaaand there it is lol
RESURGENCE QUADS
I�m sorry to be that one guy but when is shipment 24/7 gonna be a solo playlist? Don�t mind shoot the ship. But i mostly get shoot house lobbies.
LOOKS LIKE DAMASCUS IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Shoot the ship again? That's crazy!!!
Aiiight looks like I can play the game again. For a week at least
.... just waiting for NVG playlist to return....
I miss cranked and cranked confirmed
I don't wanna create a post but I�m still not getting match xp. I thought that shit was fixed
"I literally have gotten nothing but TDM after TDM after TDM lobbies in Shoot the Ship

*I have lobby dodged 50+ times. I don't want to play Team Shitmatch*

PLEASE I JUST WANT TO PLAY DOMINATION"
"Did they fix the xp?

Edit: oh they did"
Cant wait to go back to trolling with my throwing knife and riot shield again on 1v1 me
Finally they added back shipment and they fixed the xp but too
I wish they added 1v1 to custom lobbies. Free for all kind of works but needs some setup.
"What about the Sykov, CX-9 and Raal?"
SHOOT THE SHIP IS FUCKING BACK LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Y'all got any tips for doing riot shield camo challenges on shoot the ship?
Anyone else not earing XP for shoot the ship?
Wait can anyone tell me how long this is going to stay for
honestly at this point IW is cock teasing with STS.
How long does STS usually stick around?
Onslaught was sucha good gamemode though...
[deleted]
"First you people complain about not having shoot the ship, and then when it arrives you just complain even more. Pathetic"
"I mean.. it kind of is tho. Lobby surfing is exactly why there is so much shoothouse and no open shipments. 

I do agree they should give us separate playlists tho."
"but it is a community made issue tho? so many people want shipment and so when they get shoothouse, they back out and therefore leaving many shoothouse servers open to fill..."
If you queue with friends it's much more 50/50 I swear
This is the modern warfare sub my guy
"There�s separate scopes for CW weapons, so you have to use those."
get outta here
Its a glitch spot if you search up crash glitch spots on youtube you can figure out how to get up there
I've never seen someone up there. Maybe they used a deployable cover?
Hmmmm ...  and for that matter the map in Gun Runner how the hell do folks get up in the cargo container that's open??  It's but the showers building near the tracks.  I've tried jumping from about everything and never can get up there??
If you do it right you can get there from the forklift
"Yup, broke on PS4 and in multiplayer. 

Kind of unplayable tbh. 

Worse in Infected, because the people with throwing knives are 100% accurate."
Fix it today? Hahahahaa good one

Time to ask why do u want shipment? Is it just for camos?
Camos and they don�t like big maps
No one wants shipment cause they *like* the map. It's just for camos. It's always been for camos.
Shipment for camos and shoot house is the most beautiful map.
I prefer shoot house less spawn traps
Camos. Need my obsidian AUG on the double

"Honestly I already uninstalled MW. I didn�t want too but I�m burnout on the current maps, playlists. 

I just want to have mindless fun on shoot-house.

And it would be nice if they brought back other maps similar to it like Kill-House, which is especially frustrating because it�s actually in the game, at Military base. 

Hell, I also really enjoyed 3v3 Respawn on Gunfight maps. But that�s also a rarity to see it come up."
I wish they would just put every single game mode and playlost they've ever had in the quickplay filter and just leave mw be
"Time to reinstall, shoot the ship is back!"
No lie there are some gems in these playlists if you give them a chance. Plus the gunfight tournaments were so fun. Realism mode being one of my favs.
We did it boys!
I hope we get a cheshire or a rust playlist its almost as good as shoothouse and shipment and good for camos
Agree on Cheshire Park. I have a lot of love for that map. It�s tends to move fast as long as you take the time to clear out the snipers on the approaches.

"Yes it would reset your battlenet account,The items and unlocks are stored on the activison account,So the accounts linked too the activison account would have the stuff because of the activison account."
Unlink your Activision account from your battle net and link a new Activision account won�t reset your account.. you�ll simply just be playing on a new fresh level 1 account. Proceed with caution tho because once you unlink your Activision account from your battle net you will not be able to unlink another Activision account to that battle net account for 12 months.
"""Fastest way""

""Wave 52 ending"""
"Yeah, I know haha, but being this is the only mode where you can level them up, this is the best I got."
"Hey there, this is the fastest way I found to level the new unreleased weapons in survival mode if you want to be slightly ahead of the curve when they do release.

How it works: This works by achieving and maintaining a 9x multiplier by using sentry gun killstreak purchased at the kiosk, as this multiplies the amount of weapon ex you get per kill. (Sentry gun kills count as normal gun kills)

Step 1: Unlock the new weapons in multiplayer, through their corresponding challenges. The Sykov pistol is unlocked by getting 4 pistol kills with a pistol in 5 different multiplayer matches and the CX-9 SMG is unlocked through getting 2 SMG longshots in 5 different multiplayer matches.

Step 2: Queue Survival, and try to get a map that has a good defendable location that is also reasonably close to the killstreak kiosk. Due to the low amount of damage you can take, it�s best to have a camping spot where you can funnel enemies to you from only one direction. The maps I found worked best were Shoot House, Superstore, Grazna Raid, and Azhir Cave. Make sure to regularly buy armor from the killstreak kiosk.

Step 3: If you have a full squad play normally until the enemy counter per round is about 35-40 enemies per round at which point start you start placing sentry guns in high traffic locations. Sentry guns can last for two rounds IF you pick them up between rounds, as this stops 1 minute countdown they have before exploding. This method becomes more effective the higher into the rounds you go as there will be more enemies to maintain a 9x multiplier. Note: On round 14 there will always 70+ enemies.

It took me a little over an hour a gun from level 8 to 34. It�s not super fun, but this is the most effective method I found. Regardless, I hope you guys have a good day.

Edit: RAAL LMG is currently not unlockable through mutiplayer, however you can still use it if you go offline."
"I can't unlock the RAAL LMG, I get kills using a scout optic on my PKM and it just doesn't track"
"One question, co-op xp is work?"
Wait a sec you can unlock those two guns already ?
I can't believe I've never seen this before
Wait so sentry gun kills counts as weapon xp too?
"Yes, it does count. You do not have to shoot at all if you don't want to."
"always has, i've used it in the bank coop mission to level everything lmao"
"No, it just makes it easier to keep a 9x multikill multiplier up"
"I never thought of this, mine are already max, but I popped double weapon xp tokens and grinded a while back. Hope your strat helps others!"
Does the LMG challenge work? I got 15 kills with the optic on bruen and it still says 0/7
"1) They dont actively track for any challenges.  
2) I think the RAAL is broken, i went in about 20 games and nada"
Is it even worth guys? The roadmap for season two revealed 6 guns and none of those were our 3 new mw guns. So I don't really see them coming soon to be honest unfortunately
Unrelated but I have a theory that when these guns release their xp progress will be reset
No they won�t
You are my saviour thank you
"The Rytec isn't an ""Unreleased gun"""
"Sorry, I was just using it as an example. It was the only footage I had."
When are these guns comin to Multiplayer?
You can get them at weapon drops but it�s pure chance
The rytec isn't an unreleased gun
[removed]
What bennifit do you get spamming this same bull shit on EVERY POST. Go back to your hole troll.
same bro. happened a couple days ago. did you find anything?
I don't know what happened but from one day to the next it just started working again. I did notice a small patch of like 20mb maybe.
"I was called a camper after getting pinged by a sniper, crawling into a corner, self rez, and managed to mag dump a fennec on some dude that came in at just the wrong instant. 

Like, I'd been in the corner for however long it took to revive and have the animation swap to the gun, and got super lucky shots on the guy.

""Camper""."
They're just running away from their problems
"I keep getting abused for hard scoping, funny thing there the ones hardscoping I don�t even aim till I actually se the other players like bruh do you even know what hard scoping is"
"No one wants to play lanes. No one wants to hold a specific point on the map for one to two minutes. Even if it means dying multiple times or losing the match. It�s simply not fun. Playing the objective and winning the match gives you absolutely nothing back. Just gives you a higher win/lose ratio, which no one can see anyways. Or cares about. People want kills, they want to drop more than 20 kills per game. Not sit on the hard point for 2 minutes. Top of the leaderboard with 7 kills and 16 deaths in a whole game of hard point. Is that what you want? Not to mention it�s annoying as fuck to play a game of MW, where the whole opposition team is holding every lane possible. Makes the game slower than it already is. This is also why we want shipment and shoot house, but even then kids will still mount on the barrels. Honestly search and destroy is the only game mode where every play style and map is playable. The only game mode where 6v6 on arklov peak isn�t a game of hide and seek"
Sort of do or die for me.  I just bought the game a week and a half ago so my entire experience so far has been broken where I�m locked at level 1.  The game wasn�t cheap even at 25% off and my entire experience is negative beyond the very short but decent campaign.  I don�t have an investment in the game yet beyond what I spent so if they don�t fix it I�m deleting it�s massive bloated girth off my hard drive.
"Yea it�s like 200gb it�s crazy. It�s a shame you haven�t experienced anything other than it being broken. This is another major point on why they should fix the game, a lot of people have bought it recently due to Cold War being a flop, if people leave before it gets fixed I very much doubt they will return to cod as a whole in the future."
Same for me. Bought 3 weeks ago and two straight have been utterly pointless because I can�t progress at all without switching to war zone
"I agree.  I took a break from this game back in October and just came back a few weeks ago, and then XP just stopped.  Gun xp seems to work, but still no player xp.  I have fun playing but at the end of match when it says 0 or 100 xp gained, it sucks and I just turn it off.  I played one game the past week just to see if it was fixed...nope.  So I will play later today and if it's still broken then I'll uninstall."
"Man, the only way I can get exp right now is playing co-op. That gets old really fast especially because I�ve been playing some of the missions repeatedly since launch lol."
Just started playing again recently after two months away. Shocked that I couldn�t level up normally through playing multiplayer. I loved this game back when warzone/Cold War weren�t featured so heavily in the menu screen. Activision really need to sort themselves out or people are just gonna leave the franchise completely as multiple people have said on here already. Considering quitting the game again tbh...
"In all honesty, despite its issues and bugs, the game was alright, Cold War released and ruined mw and wz imo. That game is a dumpster fire and just destroys everything it�s near."
"Gun XP, challenges, and camo was fixed for me a week ago. Player xp is still broken tho."
Both are still inconsistently broken for me.
If anything they shouldve made warzone exp glitched instead. It wouldn�t make a big difference since it�s already really slow and at least that way mw won�t suffer. They would even make more money because people will have to buy the games to level up quickly.
They need to not add updates that break shit and then not fix it.
None.
"I doubt activision will help at all. I�ve seen hundreds of posts just like this, and even when activision reply, I think they will just say there�s nothing they can do. I�ve always been scared of losing my account but there�s nothing you can do to stop it. I don�t want to ruin all your hope, I�m just saying that�s what normally happens. 
If you have the dudes email and address I would take matters into my own hands and try make him give it back (as long as you�re sure the email and address are correct) the account is worth basically no monetary value to the hacker anyways, since it�s hard to turn skins back into cash"
"Damn. I was really hoping I could get it back cleanly through activision but I guess I gotta play dirty too. I have his address and he hasn�t removed my friends off my account so I�m just gonna try to join a lobby the next time he logs on, threaten him with his address and if that doesn�t scare him into giving my account back I�ll have to search around for people I can pay to hack the account back into my hands. If neither works I�ll try to chargeback as much of the stuff I bought as I can."
"I got my account stolen yesterday. Can't do anything about it and lost over 300$ on it too. I created a new account and I am simply not buying anything from activision anymore. if they can't help us, I won't help them. That's all there is left to do"
"Try this process out if you haven't yet. My account was stolen a couple weeks ago. I went through this recovery process, and while it took about a week of waiting to hear from them, I got my account restored a few days ago. I have no idea if it works out for all recovery requests, but it's worth a shot.  
[https://support.activision.com/account-recovery](https://support.activision.com/account-recovery)"
"Really sorry to hear this. I recently had my account hacked as well. I went to their support page to open a ticket, followed all the steps they suggested (create a new Activision account, link all my other game and social accounts to it, and request a recovery of the old Activision account). They immediately sent an email saying the ticket was opened and that it might take up to 10 business days to resolve. Took about a week of waiting, but they finally got my account back for me, all progress and purchases restored."
"This is the process in particular that got my account back, worth trying if you haven't yet!  
[https://support.activision.com/account-recovery](https://support.activision.com/account-recovery)"
Amazing.

If you didn�t own the season it was released you won�t progress with the challenge.  Unfortunately they have not fixed this so it shows the challenges but you can�t actually complete them at this time.
Barracks > multiplayer challenges > missions > operator mission mara
"there is no multiplayer challenges under barracks section. I'm playing on PC, not PS4"
"And its just 15 elims with smg for an emblem, then next mission is play a ground war match, one after is 3 elims without death 3 times, then the last one is 2 finishing moves"
"You mention not knowing how Huskers plays on a setting then mention you don�t need a big mousepad, I play on 7.5 and 1200 dpi and have a huge mousepad which still helps a lot, especially when ADS. Do bigger sweeps and you should be ok"
"I don't think you understand. I need only 24 cm for 360. My mouse pad is 36cm and I never needed more with legacy. But with relative at 1.33 to even do 180 I need more than that. My mind is saying wtf with this such low setting. Why the ads sens should be that slow? Relative at 2.50 is ok for me because when I need 24cm for my 360 with 2.50 I need like 30cm for 360 after ads, and it's fine.

I just wonder why someone would want that slow ads sens with such low monitor coefficient.
If you play with 1200 dpi 7+ sens you are used to wrist movement and you don't need a lot of mouse pad space. If someone like us use the relative with low ads you instantly becoming a Huskerrs with his low 400 dpi 5 sens. You know what I mean?"
Also imagine how do you want to train your sensitivity in kovaak or aimlab. When you doing it with ur global sensitivity. And how can u train ur ads sens if it's 5x slower than ur global sens
Just play on the other sens mode then you aren�t obliged to choose the one causing you issues
"I use 0 monitor coefficient on all my games, its so underrated if you actualy understand what it does. Using 1.33 or 1.78 might feel better because ads 360 distance more closely matches your hip 360 distance, but its scaling up how fast the cursor moves to do that, and its different for every optic/fov.
0 coefficient doesn't scale your cursor velocity up or down, so your flicks for every optic feel the same, its just based off the 2D distance from your reticle to your target. For example, if you were standing say 20 meters back from two targets and you aim in with a 1x sight and flick between them, youll have to move your mouse 1 inch for each flick (just arbitrary numbers for the example) if you moved 40 meters back from those same targets, then aimed in with a 2x zoom scope, youll have to move your mouse 1 inch again, so its as if you physically moved 2 times closer to the target and had a 1x optic. If you went back to being 20 meters away, then aimed with the 2x, youll then have to move your mouse 2 inches for the flick, because its like your standing standing really close to them with a 1x optic. like is said before, using a coefficient above 0 would scale your cursor velocity and sensitivity up with the new fov of the 2 times scope, so the distance and speed you have to move your mouse for a flick would be different for every fov and every sight. If you learn to judge your flicks based off the 2D distance from your reticle to your target, then using 0 will let you learn muscle memory way faster, because it doesnt matter what game, fov, or how much zoom an optic has. Its all the same. Once i started using it, i started to get a lot better and way more consistent. I play on a kinda medium sens, 1600 dpi 2.5 ingame, and i have a 40ish cm mousepad. One end to the other does a little over a 360"
"Ok I managed to lower my monitor distance coefficient to 1.78, but its like impossible to me to lower it bellow 1.00, any advice? As I said its so weird for my hand and mind to have such slow ads sens compare to hipfire"
"Ok guys, I found this and I get used to use Monitor Distance Coefficient @ 1.33:  
[https://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2979150494051524581/](https://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2979150494051524581/)  


But... Since the sensitivity was very slow for me when zooming in (compare to hipfire), especially with snipers like kar98k I increased the ads low and high to 1.25 (instead of 1.0).  
Now the question is, is that good? Can I change these low&high values?   


I actually wanna compare monitor distance coefficient at 0.00 but then I guess I will need to boost up my ads low&high to like 1.50. Does it make difference if I use 0.00 or 1.33?"

I could be blatantly hacking my ass off and you guys still wouldn't buy into the fact I'm cheating. I'm not going to do that of course because I'm not a cheater nor do I own a PC, but holy shit are you guys making it look like a juicy forbidden fruit. No damn wonder why hackers get away with their shit. You guys are just as in denial as Rainbow 6 players when it comes to hit registration.

If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then stop questioning them and report 'em to Activision. Even if it turns out to be a grown ass man in a donald duck costume, still report them and leave it up to the developers to judge them just in case."
2nd clip is a little sus but 1st clip is definitely not enough for me to think he's cheating. Also you challenged this guy to a 1v1 and then used an mp5 and a 725? Who the hell does that?
"Nope, I challenged someone completely different, but that person invited his friend and said ""1v1 him instead"" and thats who I ended up 1v1ing. When you try to look up his stats on cod.tracker.gg he doesn't show up. ALL STATS were made public after the ban wave. Now why is that? Try solving that mystery for me and then come back and tell me he doesn't use software to hack into games and game stats.

EDIT: Found him. https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/profile/atvi/Deadly%233029043/mp"
"1st clip: Looks 100% normal, you didn't relocate, he assumed you were still there and guessed right. He also wasn't 'tracking' you, he actually incorrectly tracked you at 0:20 into 0:21, his scope went to the right a little bit then went up as he saw you peek at the top.

2nd clip: Easily explained away as a UAV / personal radar up. I've done something similar to this many times. You could say 'they had none', but the clip doesn't confirm that at all, and you could easily have mis-remembered there not being one.

For the record, I'm a 2.07 K/D, 2.62 W/L, and a 560 SPM player who plays kill confirmed. Feel free to confirm stats [here](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/profile/battlenet/Auxilae%231389/mp). (SPM doesn't track KC here) According to that stat tracker website I ranked in top 2% of K/D. None of this is suspicious in the slightest, you shouldn't be encouraging people going on witch-hunts after being sour over some deaths, especially when these clips are nowhere near conclusive."
"I really think the advent of cross play is turning console players neurotic. They�ve never seen what a PC player looks like and I get people calling me a cheater or accusing others constantly. I try to explain to people in lobbies that a good low sens PC player will look like aim bot. The tracking on an enormous mousepad vs a joystick is night an day. I don�t really think these are definitive cheaters, but they�re definitely out there, please be careful who you report !"
"nah, it's sus. I also had an snd match where a guy was literally tracking through walls on an entire team. he was wiping us. never even shot at an empty spot, was tracking movements behind walls in killcams."
"Do [these stats](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/profile/atvi/Deadly%233029043/mp) look completely normal to you? Only 7hours played and what does he have? 4.0 kd, highest killstreak of 28, and nonstop banger games. Going crazy in all his recent matches and never getting a single bad, even, or slightly above average game. They are all bangers. With only 7 hours played..."
That first one definitely doesn't look like cheats
"Check his stats, go to recent matches too, scroll down and consider the game modes he's playing"
I have the same issue but I�m able to actually launch the game and play. After a few rounds...sometimes even an hour of play I get an error and either the game quits OR the whole system freezes. I�ve redownloaded the packs multiple times. This game was actually more functional about 1 month ago on ps5. Not sure what�s going on TBH
"Game is a mess right now, they have a big patch for the new season but nothing before that. I guess it will fix a lot of issues"
Only problem I�ve been having is every once in a while on my ps5 the fucking game uninstalls my multiplayer packs only. As if they�re trying to make me play Cold War or Warzone
I love it too. But not when they�re holding an RPG.
Rusty Shipment best pornstar name ever
Had a good wank to the name?
I'm cool with dirty old houseboat
"You mean ""Rusty"" cuz i can see from now people gonna say i only get rust."
"Are you smooth brained? Rust is awful, shoot house is so much better"
[deleted]
"Dunno man, there are people who unironically love it (I do)"
Rust is fun af. Way better than scrapyard.
absolutely true
just say you want a rust 24/7 playlist because you know you would barely get shipment
"That happens because everyone would leave the rust lobbies to try to get shipment lobbies, so theres always way more rust lobbies open and all the shipment lobbies will always be full"
Rust is garbage
"They did oxidisation floatation which was rust and shipment before, it sucked"
Shoot house > shipment > rust.
the only thing rust was ever good for was 1v1s
Rust is a shite map
"One of my favourite maps is rust maybe even my favourite, always plays well and smoothly."
I like rust. Just get an RPG to deal with the rooftop campers.

You're probly gonna get suspended if you keep spamming this on every post
"Did you buy and complete the season one battlepass? If you did then yes that op mission is bugged for you. If you didn't, or you did but didn't progress far enough to unlock that skin you won't be able to get it now."
You don�t even own the mission you�re not entitled to it.
"I have one of the Mara skins, and the mission is marked as 'active' in the operator menu. It just doesn't progress at all."
I feel ya. No one wanted to play SnD with me and since Warzone is out anyone barely plays multiplayer. Funny thing is. Before Warzone everyone complained that you have only 1 life per round and they dont like to wait and in warzone you wait way longer until you get revived.
Snd solo is pretty fun most of the time. After a few games I ussualy find a chill team with mics and party up for while
"I was like your friends once. Untill I tried it a few games, now I think SND is the most fun mode to play. Not getting killed and just showing who�s superior is the most fun part. 

Try betting them they cant get more than 10kills in 1 game, or even get 1.000 points. Thats pretty hard for most ppl to achieve in SND."
Same
I think just gotta get them used to the social banter. Def makes or breaks the experience. Nothing better then a only semi toxic rowdy group
Don't make it serieus. Make it fun.
Snd? Yeah I'm trying to keep it casual. Is SBMm thick in every single mode? That's my one gripe. I'm confident that what I watch will be much different from what I play
You may have to pump gas through their windows like something out of a Batman movie
"People play however they want. CoDs most popular game mode is TDM and there�s nothing wrong with that. It�s fun, and not everyone likes the stress that comes from SnD."
"I think snd is the best mode to socialize with your friends. The round based nature and targeted calliuts are just... sublime. It's more predictable than TDM.

Also dying from streaks over, and over, and over again while also having to deal with players on the ground is objectively not fun. 

Unpopular opinion but the 3-5-7 system was best. MW2 said bigger is better and they were wrong in that area.

Just because wild killstreaks haven't been questioned doesn't mean they were ok from a game balance perspective. The game becomes unplayable with certain streaks in the air. As the person streaking, it's not fun either cux it takes away people for you to shoot.

They were supposed to be relatively small rewards for doing well, not keys to a high af kill game. Let those come from your guns"
"If you�re ever down for HC SND me and my squad are always open to new players. I have a 1.58 KD so our SBMM gets filthy pretty fast. But add up anyways! We�re on most nights. Lmk if you added me so that I know it�s you :)

"SMG with 5mW laser, seems about right"
"I tested this with all the smgs, merc grip, 5mw, and shortest barrel. You pretty much don't have to ads at all. Mp7 was by far the best for it."
"I use this in warzone. Mono, Merc, 5mw, 60rd, stippled. You literally never have to ADS. Hits every hip fire shot and does the same damage to limbs/legs as it does chest. 

Ttk is only a millisecond or 2 higher than mac10 too"
Who uses a spotter scope
It�s actually super useful to use. Almost every time i�ve used it i�ve been able to spot a player and know which area to avoid or plan ahead to cut him off
Bruh I can imagine how shaky your hands must�ve been
Haha you should have seen my heart rate rise higher and higher after each kill.
I clutched the other day and I did the last 3 enemies dirty
Well done friend! Have it recorded?
firing me up right now!
Calm under pressure.
"Bro. Nice, running double stims and almost dying for the whole round... And not stimming. Big ball play."
console peasent
"Haha maybe I�m crazy (or not) I think it�s the best looking COD ever made

**Psst! OP maybe you should check out some Cold War gameplay and report back on what you think

It�ll be very insightful"
"Stop playing in 720p lol jk. Can�t say I share your opinion but hey, I�m just one dude. I think the game looks great - especially with RTX on."
I also think the game looks amazing
Your paragraph is indecipherable.
"Oh, what I would do to have lobbies like that..."
It�s because they want infinityward to work on cod2021 already and wants sledgehammer and raven to focus on Warzone and MW
There are posts of Sledgehammer games making COD2021...
"Yea from everything I�ve heard and read infinity war is cod 2022, sledgehammer is going to be making cod 2021 and it is rumored to be a 1950s era Korean War game."
"Except Treyarch didn�t neglect BO4 like this when they began work on Cold War. This is on Infinity Ward, not Activision."
I still pissed that they haven't fixed the XP issue. Not getting anything from ingame. No kill xp ingame either. Just unbelievable
Dont worry treyarch will abandon BOCW as soon as next games comes out
I highly doubt it cause of the seasons you know
Soap will prolly come for the wz 1 year anniversary with the winter map
They aren't going to fix it because they are busy with MW2021.
"It depends on the map I think. On really open maps like Tank factory you literally cannot move. 

Having anti jugg clsses is also a must. Thermites, explosive JAK12, stuns etc

Would be interesting to see it in 10v10 on maps like Arklov Peak. Maybe if they made the capture time shorter too"
"You�re right on both accounts. I played a few matches afterward and it definitely made a difference with both the map being played, and having a lobby that was full of players with anti juggernaut class set ups.  (Not saying I was super thrilled playing the mode, just that they made a difference on how the game was played)"
"Not just you, that mode makes me wanna cut myself, then pour hand sanitizer into the cuts. Awful mode. Really hard to actually stop the juggernaut."
I only played it once. Will say it was a nice change in pace. It's better than TDM that's for sure.
Just you for sure
I think its just given if you buy the game digitally tho idk
"I bought the game digitally for the normal price ($60), and I've always had the XRK M4. I didn't even know it was a paid item. So yeah I think you're right"
Just buy digital
Say hello to MW�s still broken spawn system
Dude for real! Rust is a mess
"Yep, that�s the spawn point under the pipe where you either spawn trap or get spawn trapped, especially on onslaught"
Gotta love them Rust spawns!
I still play this game regularly. My favorite cod in a long time and likely has another year or two left in it.
"When new games do come out are these generally abandoned for the next by the playerbase? 

I�m hoping to invest a lot of time but if it�s on its way out I might just wait"
"Yeah. It is pretty fun game. (what i remember before barrett was added, because i stopped playing the game after it. I didn't like connecting keyboard and mouse to xbox all the time. I will be buying the game for pc.)"
"Its a great game you won't be disappointed. Best cod you'll play in years. Actually polished and they have balanced the guns based on player feedback. Many things to unlock, mastery camos, guns, melee, and with cold wars integration you can actually play as much as you want in a season and it'll show your rank in a better manner thank it used to."
"has the XP bug been fixed though? i haven't played recently but if the bug is still around, then honestly i don't recommend OP buys this game because he won't be able to level up at all"
"I say jump in, still super fun to play lol. Definitely one of the best CODs released"
"Also, campaign is amazing ! If you like single player"
"Best cod I yeaaaaaaars, 100% get it"
"came back to MW from Cold War - without a doubt my favorite COD since BO2. 

the next Battlefield is probably the move when it comes out."
Buy it you won�t regret it
Not for full price.
"Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aDGDeyz1f0&feature=emb_logo), people here praise the game but it's honestly in a terrible state. All the clips are less than 1 month old."
Just started playing this game again myself there�s still a good player base
"At this point, fuck no, shit ton of bugs and the ""fixes"" either add more or does other wacky shit."
"What do you mean by war experience, because kf you want a real battle feel, call of duty is not the game"
"I just mean like point and shooty guns and teams honestly, hahaha! It doesn�t need to be historical or anything"
I bought it a couple of weeks ago fuck Cold War this is where it�s at my friend
That was beautiful
"Thanks, although this kind of stuff is why I usually skip this map, I only play it if I'm not playing with my crew.

I prefer maps where you have to think about flanking and spawns and all that to these random shitshows in tiny maps."
Did you try the -d3d11 fix? Or update Windows to the latest version?
Yes I have
"Roll back your driver's to the month it was working ok. 

Does any other game do this? 

Post the rest of your hardware might help us out. 

Include cpu, memory, mobo, hdd, power supply, windows build etc."
"It�s just modern warfare that does. I have a Ryzen 7 3800x, 32 gigs of Corsair vengeance ram at 3200, 750 watt power supply 4TB western digital hdd, and a b550 mobo"
You still need to unlock gold on the spr to get platinum
I have gold and obsidian unlocked for the spr already
U could have used the heli to destroy the attack chopper tho

Shit video mate
I�m glad it�s not just me who�s having a problem with the kill score showing...
It's such a pain..
"The music, the random AFK dude, the pissed lobby.... I�m in love"

Yeah you can�t do camo challenges vs ai it has to be in a multiplayer mode
Such crap....the dragon breath one in particular with reloading....I never play MP so it is gonna take eons to unlock.
"It has to be multiplayer to unlock the weapons.  For example, the kali sticks require so many kills with a combat knife while sliding.  If you do it in multiplayer it unlocks them and I believe you can do it in Warzone too, but co-op doesn�t count towards the challenge."
"Mental. I can�t even see the person in the scope but somehow you have, and you�ve aimed, and adjusted, and pulled the trigger"
You can't see in the video due to quality but pretty much all these guys are rocking Green lasers
This reminds of the good old cod days with everyone screaming after a teammate clutching. Great clip
I count 6 bruh
Hahaha didn't even notice :')
What's your sens at?
"I run about 2,000 DPI at 16.5 sens give or take 200dpi depending on my swett level"
Amazing play!

">level 1

no because the keys are region locked i think."
WTF? You copy pasted my post?
Fucking rat bastard.
I think its just randomly happen i don't know if there is an explanation sometimes it says there is something to install but there isn't so I have know idea what caused it
"Wrong post, this is mw, not cw."
"No shit, I launched MW and wasn't able to play until I downloaded CW content, but I restarted and it was fixed. This post can honestly be deleted."
Update: I restarted Modern Warfare and it's fixed. But what was the problem in the first place?
"The first slide is Al Raad Airbase, 2nd is Killhouse, the 3rd slide looks to be Takedown but I could be wrong and the 4th is the 2v2 Gunfight map Drainage.


These will most likely drop along with the RAAL MG, Sykov and CX-9 presumably with the Soap Operator Bundle as well


A shame this will most likely be the final content drop for MW.  Activision had a gem with this game and it�s honestly one of my favorite games of all time but you know how the saying goes.  Nothing good can stay forever."
"Dude download DDU (display driver uninstaller), go into safe mode, & use that program to wipe your video card driver out. Then after it restarts go to nvidia/amds website (whichever one you have) and download the driver for your card. Run it & make sure you click clean install before you let it install. That should fix it. It�s usually a video card driver issue when that error happens."
Ok I�ll give this a shot thank you!!
"I�m sorry about your situation. I have no clue about anything related to PCs but I can tell you that on any platform, uninstalling and reinstalling your game works 90% of the time. Now, if it keeps your progress I don�t know. Though it should because as long as you can log into your Activision account your progress will be saved. Hope this helped!"
Yeah I�ve uninstalled the game and it still keeps popping up that error message :/ at this point I�ve lost hope of playing again :(

Have you reset the game? This happens to me often when my console disconnects from my wifi.
Hold power button until it turns off
"Just hit the PS button, then the option button and close application, restart the game."
Maybe to nudge you into moving on to Cold War and Warzone?
"LOL, that's what I thought as well but Activision can't be that evil. Can they? Yes, they can!"
Well they're doing everything to make it seem like MW and CW are the same game. Why not performance wise?
Right!!? On Cold War my frames are way above 120 but not MW. Seems like they want MW to die out!
"that�s weird, the modified spec ops should rotate weekly, or whenever the multiplayer side gets a playlist update."
I was (still is I guess) scared the support for the game was already dropping after only one year... And I paid almost full price the sales on MW are terrible. Meager 25% off on ps4
Playlist updates are different now with BOCW integration with Warzone so it might be today as well.
With that aim I too would have a tight butthole.
Dude it's so tight
[deleted]
Is that the appropriate place for this clip? I don't post often
loose pp hole
But wow the aim lol your must have really been stressing
I
My guy you keep getting downvoted to hell
Thats what happens when you say mobile gamers arent real gamers these kids dont wanna accept the truth
It does stop u from being one shot.
"No, it doesn't. I've had it equipped and I'll still get insta killed by RPGs and C4. Albeit, RPGs are incredibly inconsistent, so I'll live one time, die the next. It's just inconsistent and it shouldn't be."
"EOD caps damage at 80. If you are less than 80 HP you'll get one shot by explosives, but otherwise you will survive 

It doesn't protect against direct impacts or multiple explosions. EG semtex blowing up a car will kill you"
So you want to survive a direct impact RPG or a C4 right at your feet. Bro it's a perk not a freakin hack. If you can't notice the C4 ON THE FLAG you deserve to die no matter your set up anyway. It's the flag. Of course people are gona trap it. EOD saves you from any resonable explosive radius. It does a pretty good job at it already.
"I'm not just talking about direct hits. I'm talking about explosions near by from an RPG. I've been killed numerous times by RPG's blast radius right outta spawn. EOD is inconsistent and is almost like I don't have it equipped at all most times I use it. I don't know if it being unreliable was a design decision or if it's just a bug, but right now, I get no noticeable benefits while using it."
"Same reason why bh is so weak, it gives more kills and easier kills to more people."
Who the fuck uses thermal for quickscoping...
I dunno I never liked thermals except for smgs sometimes but different strokes for different folks I say
Another thing thermals do point out the body parts very well so it�s good for headshots I will give it thats
"Didn't I just state in the title that I'm not really much of a quickscoper?

Oh well shows what I know about monkeys and typewriters....

Besides using thermal sight can actually put you in a advantage if you're a sniper

If you throw a smoke grenade and since you had a thermal sight you enemies can't see you but you can see them

( unless they use a thermal sight as well)

It is a very good strategy especially if you're a sniper and it can save your ass

And most quickscopers don't even use thermal sights they just run around like a chicken with its head cut off 

Expecting kills left and right eye for the so-called montage on a YouTube channel which no one gives a shit about"
This is why my hdr is a secondary to my AK cause it is good and u can pop off with it quick and no scoping
"Forget collecting all three. Collect 1 or 2 and use this:

I did. i only got 2 and figured out the last number. it still never allowed me to pick up the gun
[deleted]
Exactly. u spend so long and u feel this sense of accomplishment when u do it only to be rewarded with nothing.
Worked for me last week?
It seems to work for some people but for others it will never work no matter how many times you do it. i heard one guy done it 12 times and still never got it

"In stadium you can find some keycards and figure out some numbers that you input into a locked and you get a, Amax blueprint"

This is some fucking battlefield trailer shit
"Seriously, I'm getting flashbacks to BF4 and I never even played that game."
"Oh man battlefield 4...

Honestly my GOAT 'modern military' fps"
they need to have a bf version of wz
That hot mic would�ve been HOT
"I was laughing so hard that I, unfortunately, couldn�t hear them."
Holy shit! That�s epic
yeah what an absolutely cinematic moment
Thanks man! It was satisfying af
Nice!!!!
Fuckin badass
That was sexy as FUCKK!
Got em
Holy fuck that's awesome
This is probably the most badass thing I�ve ever seen in call of duty and I�ve been playing since CoD 4
"�Fuck you, Chelios!�"
Did you make Chelios bleed out on the ice?
Thats some mission impossible shit.
Yo you are a mad lad holy epic shit
Cheshire is the map for team defender because of the amount of camping spots. Especially the bus lane
"I thought Broadcast would be really fun, especially if you stay outside the main building but it was laughable lol how many times I got picked off crouching near a window lol"
"Crash is fun because an FMJ PKM can wallbang a lot of stuff, especially floor/ceiling 

Shoothouse is stupid because everyone camps the office. It's better when people move and hold off different corners of the map though 

Cheshire is pretty good because of the buildings around the map."
"yeah shoothouse is kinda lame

I really like running up in the hotel on Crash on thar roof with a sentry gun and having proxy's on the staircase
Cheshire was pretty decent I totally agree except when things get overly crowded in the restaurant and you can't see squat and a one shot from out of nowhere

RUST is a total cluster fuck lol"
"No, Activision doesn't care"
Lol no they just will ignore it. They may email you if anything and you can appeal a suspension or ban.
"No worries, Activision will do exactly the same they do if you REPORT LEGITIMATE HACKER - NOTHING."
False reports are 10 day ban if i recall correctly.
Nothing won�t happen. You�ll will be fine
Mandatory 10 day ban for false reporting.
10 day ban for false reports
"At this point, activision doesn't do jack shit with reports, until recently when  important streamers began leaving the game"
"Theoretically there is a penalty for false reporting, but definitely not for a one time accident. And Activision doesn't care, even if the report was correct"
I�m afraid activision will send a rep to your house for a witness statement they will have to take your console away so that they can export all evidence of the �hacker� they will then wipe your memory and leave a Nintendo switch in its place
Yes
That kd though
Would be interesting to see if anyone has more kills with juggernaut than me :D
how much you got?
Oh totally - get so pissed that I rage quit while screaming everyone is a cheater and the game sucks and I�m done (which wakes up the wife) but than I see clips on Reddit and YouTube next day and the boys message they on and I�m right back at it. Fucking rinse and repeat
I do the same dumb shit.
"Because there�s nothing similar atm. Once battlefield 6 comes out Activision will drastically change, they�ll make changes everyone wants, they�ll sort out the SBMM and cheaters and bugs because they�ll have some competition and will urgently be trying to retain players and keep content fresh. But yeah it�s sad to say but they have no incentive to change at this moment as there still making millions a week from micro transactions."
Honestly I hope bf6 releases first and the cod preorders are just nonexistent so they are forced to make the game we want.
"Because there's not much competition in the ""casual shooter"" niche"
"If only there was more, I�ve been finding myself playing more overwatch lately because I can�t make it a hour into this game anymore and Cold War is just like a steaming pile of dog shit."
"My last CoD game prior to MW2019 was CoD4 PC. When Activision shafted the PC version of MW2 (Removed a lot of PC features that was in CoD4) I stopped playing Cod games and eventually moved to BF3 then BF4. 

I got MW2019 on day 1 and played it daily for a long time. I did not buy CW because I wasn't interested in it. If Activision left MW2019 alone and gave the community some control over maps etc I would have likely have bought the next MW but now I doubt I'll touch a new CoD again. 

I'm just waiting for BF6 at this point."
"I only play a game or two after a session of Warzone,  like a coffee after lunch or dinner. I haven't had a full session of MW multiplayer in at least a bunch of months. CW can be stressful, but it's better for rushing so I often play that."
Cold War feels like I�m playing a 10 year old game that is lucky if it can run for an hour without kicking me back to the lobby with some obscure error.
"I grew up playing cod at a friend�s house, couple years after that, Cod 4 MW had come out, and we were all in different towns or countries by then, but wanted that same running around shooting each other for fun, of course MW was a whole different deal, like weapon progression and unlocking perks, we were hooked, sorta became a way to stay in touch and have fun. 
We did it with WaW, MW2,Black Ops, MW3, Black Ops 2, then stopped, and kinda also stopped having an excuse to take a break from our lives to play call of duty, that was our dumb justification. Once it stopped being a bonus for advanced Infinite Super Smash Brawl Warfare, we bought the remastered version of Cod 4, loved it, played together again. When 2019 came around, we thought it would be fun and  bought it. It was uuuh...we mostly play co-op games now.  No way we can compete with the reflexes of people playing today, like we are all always tired and lacking proper sleep, have like 30 minutes of free time, yeah, I get it for people who are good at the game(and somehow now have laser rifles, that actually startled the first time it happened, i wasn�t expecting lasers), I liked the campaign mode for both Cold War and MW 2019, and Zombies are kinda fun.  but it�s too much stuff to process, i mean imagine last time you played was on Monday, you do another session today, the pop up thing says new stuff that i still don�t get has been added, cool idc, wtvr, ok cool, get everyone in the lobby, pray that nobody�s game crashes, and we get wrecked immediately or the match has terrible connection, or game crashes. 
I want to come back, bc it can be fun, but...it generally is a nightmarish waste of time. 
Idk, we�ll probably buy the next one(if we even can, things ain�t so certain nowadays), but...I don�t think I�d even try to play it if i didn�t have this years old tradition with my friends. Like, some of the things these studios do, are not acceptable for the price you pay for the game and budget they have to make it. 
Everyone�s got their own reasons, but I doubt anyone�s is �bc I enjoy the inconsistent matchmaking and love how hard it is to even play(not challenging, hard as in making the game work properly)�. Not judging, just my opinion."
"We keep coming back because the core game is just brilliant. We deal with the overwhelming problems with the game because of how fun it is. That's what I think. Like a battered wife, we are gonna return for that makeup sex with daddy Activision because dick too bomb."
"I think if the next game is a flop after the disaster that was Cold War a lot of people aren�t gonna keep giving them chances, not with other options coming out."
I had a similar thing happen when I unlocked some sort of Cold War content somehow. It�s just another bug nothing to worry about.
"i see, thabk you."
I was using the mp7 and it said I unlocked a new smg called the CX-9 and there�s a green dot on the smg class but no gun shows up
"The gun has yet to be released in MP and Warzone, but you can use it in survival."
"Mine does that sometimes, and most times it�s when the servers are down, but at the moment Activision is reporting servers are good. You can check [here](https://support.activision.com/onlineservices.Call%20of%20Duty:%20Modern%20Warfare.html) for future reference, but since it says they�re active, it�s either the beginning of an outage, or the game is being dumb. I�d wait it out for a while and try again.

You could also report the outage to them"
I have that issue from time to time. Just wait it out and see what happens.
"While the game definitely has gotten harder without it, I honestly find it a blessing and a curse. I�ve seen myself improve, and am considering just turning it off the whole time. However I can definitely understand the frustration cause it messes with the KD for a while. I doubt they�ll look into it, but here�s hoping"
"And that�s why I turned off aim assist on day 1, never gonna miss it if it goes away."
what? mouse aiming is horrible and has been since start.
"Mouse aiming is fine, it's on your end"
Do you mean mouse aiming on consoles? I don't notice anything wrong with mouse aiming on pc.
Blame the rage quiters
"...please tell me you're not backing out after you finish a game?

The backfilling logic is very simple.  The FIRST GAME after hitting queue has a chance to be a backfill. Every game after that is 100% guaranteed to be a new game. Don't back out of the lobby search, just let it find you a new match after the game ends"
"I just sat in the lobby, and let the game do its thing. I played a Piccadilly match against my will just because I didnt wanna search for a new game to get backfilled in (unfortunately it wasnt a back fill, and I played 3 round draws to a match draw lol). I was testing the ""100% new game"" theory, and its just not true as far as my testing goes.  
  
4th game was Atlus, stayed in lobby, 5th was the piccadilly, stayed in lobby, was backfilled into hovec, after that was backfilled into Atlas again. I left the Atlas match though, then shut off the game.   
  
I am aware that anecdotal evidence is not evidence."
"Great job!

It's such a shame that we never got a Blueprint for the AK--47 with a top rail cover, so people could recreate guns like the AK-12/AK-15 and AK-100 series better.

It's not like it's impossible either, seeing how there's some Blueprints for both the PP-19 Bizon and PKM that have a top rail cover too."
"Yeah, the plague sore dragunov variant has a railed dust cover too. So does the amax which actually has the ak12 dust cover. But they settled for civilian sight mounts for some reason"
"Yeah. Plus, the AN-94 uses the AK-12 sights."
God I wish
"I've always wanted this style of AK ingame. I settled for an AK-200-ish build with the Spetsnaz barrel and the muzzle break. If only we had a blueprint in this style or something resembling the ""modernized"" blueprints for the bizon and dragunov it would fulfill my Kalash fantasies."
"Funny thing is that the ak-200 stock, gas block, dust cover, and pistol grip are actually in the game already, they should just go ahead and make that variant imo"
Great job brother!! Amazes me that all the Russian weapons got railed dust covers and zenitco attachments except for the AK. Even the Bizon has an RP-1 charging handle on it. Huge missed opportunity here. Not sure why this was never done.
"Hell even the svd has a railed dust cover and extended charging handle haha, meanwhile the ak has random civilian accessories on it"
Been happening since the last update.
Been happening to me too. Who do I bitch at?
"Seems they downgraded the sound quality time ago. 

I noticed that too but I believe we don�t have nothing to do here. If you find the way, PM me please."
"Dang that sucks. It's bearable on my speakers, so I guess I'll use those instead of my headphones."
"Because go play Cold War, that�s why! Except no...no I won�t Activision. Fuck you."
Yep I don�t understand how they haven�t acknowledged this issue yet. I�m on ps5 and haven�t had xp for close to 2 weeks now and my battle pass isn�t levelling up. With only 7 days left of the season I really hope we get some kind of compensation.
"I�ve been dealing with this since before the Feb 12th update and I�m so angry about it. I�ve emailed support, I�ve commented on posts, and I�ve messaged them on Twitter. I don�t understand how a company that makes millions off its customers can�t even acknowledge the issue or keep people updated. Paid 80$ for a game that I get no gain from."
"Totally mate, seems like they just dont care, shouldnt be such a problem to fix this at all."
"The absolute lack of support and concern from the company will no doubt have long term effects, as would-be repeat purchasers lose their faith in the franchise."
The only thing that is giving me xp are the challenges/missions
"Exactly, the only XPs that I have gained during the last two weeks are the ones coming from the Daily Challenges"
Yeah I�ve had this issue on pc for the last two days wtf
"Yea i forgat to mention in on ps4 tho, but indeed it seems to affect all systems wtf."
If that update had been pushed the first few months of MW 2019 being new you KNOW they would of been all over it.  Now with Raven doing rear guard on MW they don't care so much.
Very True
"Yeah I feel you. I took 2 weeks off work to chill and play. I still have played it but the lack of xp has made it less enjoyable now I am down 10 days holiday at work which wont be compensated haha. 
I've done the comments on twitter and everything but it has fallen on deaf ears. What's the best way to contact support? I am on PS5 so don't use battlenet or whatever the PC app is called."
I thought I was tripping. I've been playing with friends for about 5 hours now and non of us have leveled up once.
for me it was fixed last week
I am seriously done with this... I can't believe they keep ignoring it
"Because Raven/Treyarch are now involved due to Warzone...and we all know how well they are at fixing issues, let alone putting out a solid game"
Everything is working perfectly for me.
"Downvoting me coz I don't have the same problem as you LOL!

Thats funny as fuck!"
"I was using a SPR with Commando Foregrip and FMJ, as well as a M19 with XRK L Super, 5mW Laser, Lightweight Trigger, Rubberized Grip Tape and of course Akimbo. Try it out and see how trash it is."
"It�s a known problem, I havent been receiving any xp in over a week, who knows when/if it�ll get fixed"
OK. Then we just have to hope they care to fix it..
Same here
Same for about a week. Sucks. Wth. How is not a critical bug?

I have looked everywhere on the internet for a solution to find absolutely nothing. No one knows why it�s happening and it�s super frustrating
Well at least I know it�s not just me. I don�t play much multiplayer now but I can imagine how annoying it is to download 20Gb to play.
"Has happened to me 3 times already, what in the fuck. This game is too large to be-re-downloading all this shit over and over.  Probably on purpose too to get us to switch to Cold War.  But I won�t."
It�s actually made me stop playing the multiplayer. Granted I have fast enough internet to re-download al the packs but why it keeps deleting 80Gb of data every time is driving me nuts.
"Yupp same problem here. Happened 4 times already. Super frustrating and no solution in sight.   
I don\`t think I\`ve ever seen a company pushing another game so aggressively like it\`s being done with Cold War. Even ruining MW so players switch over. That equals with admitting that CW is a total failure of a game.   
 It\`s a damn shame really, MW is a thousand times more fun."
"They�re not doing anything about these issues. Maybe us limited ps5 players need to mass report the issue, otherwise I feel it�ll go unnoticed and un-fixed for awhile"
"Its a controller issue because in order to get a execution, you have to hold R2. Your trigger is slightly broken. What you can do is get slide kills, i think you can only get an execution when standing/crouching."
"Ok, seemed to have solved it by using the L2 button instead. Now have my Kodachis unlocked. Doesn�t resolve my apparent controller issue though."
Overkill and ghost would be far too OP...
[deleted]
"run specialist with ghost as your next perk or literally just shoot it down, you can sacrifice a weapon attachment for fmj."
[deleted]
It�s called a Pila
[deleted]
"I miss overkill being perk 1 so you could do both, just gotta run specialist and put ghost as first perk. Even tho i miss it being perk 1, i like the mind games of having to get two kills to be ghosted. Imo its balanced as perk two tho."
What stuff do you use? Like weapons and spots to go to?
"Idk about OP, but I usually stack juggernaut armor. If I don�t have juggernaut armor, I�ve got 2 LMGS with big mags and sleight of hand. A buddy and I can get past wave 100 fairly easy that way."
Better question?   Why do you have a smurf account?
Because fuck SBMM
Cuz pussy boy over there can't handle playing against his own skill level
"Maybe I'm wrong but doesn't w/l and k/d not count in Infected?

In which case, what's the point in having S3MM?"

GOALLLLLL!
"yeah, you run into a clan that uses gas grenades you might as well leave and find a different lobby. it's used as a crutch, especially after the c4 nerf. you just have to be quick and hope you face the right direction for stuns/flashes"
"I completely forgot about gas 'nades! The AOE for those damn things is way too big! I use non-lethals like anyone else, but I am not a fan of them."
Flashes and Stuns are broken. Their effects last to long. I used battle hardened and they still lasted to long.
"right? It should do so much more, but as it stands, battle-hardened is almost completely worthless."
"Battlehardened is just useless against them, that's the worst about it. You just can't counter it..."
I know there's nothing you can when you get stunned but pray that the person who stunned you sucks.

man has woke up and chose violence
Gonna show this to my step dad who thinks it�s just point and click
"It is pretty much once you get used to it. The aiming on M&K was super easy for me, it was the keyboard part that I struggled with when I started using it. Misclick after misclick. So many 'nades were thrown..."
Bro it is. If you give someone a mouse and keyboard for the first time maybe dont put them on max sensitivity...
Little sus
Yeah I think he�s aimbotting
Anywhere there :D
Whats wrong with it? Thats how i play too. Tbh he did even better than me.
Don�t even really know what I was supposed to be watching
"Them giving a guy a m&kb for the first time to try and prove that it isnt ""easy""

&#x200B;

(except the aiming part is once you get the hang of it, it the the keyboard part that is a pain)"
ur friend should quit the game
"I just use one of those converter devices when I play FPS games on console, boom and we have KB+M on console lol"
"So, your type of guy who's actively ruining r6 on console huh"
"Lmao, fucking XIM users, and let me guess? Cronus MAX for the added lack of skill?"
Modern warfare has native keyboard and mouse support..
Camo grind ruined the pace of this game.
"I got platinum AR�s about two weeks ago and I�m currently going for SMG�s at the moment because I had a number of them gold already. I, personally, don�t find it that bad as it forces you to use guns you wouldn�t normally consider, so it keeps the game fresh for me in that sense. But I do agree with you somewhat � the mounted and crouched kills to kind of mess up my preferred playstyle lol"
"Definitely the mounted kills part, ruined my KDR trying to get some guns leveled up"
One day I�m going to see a clip like this on here and I will be that guy! Haha good work though buddy!
Thanks man :) I�m in your corner!
"In the words of Will Smith "" It's rewind time"""
You're getting xp after the match?
"Sometimes  XP shows and sometimes it doesn�t, so I genuinely don�t know at this point (similar to a lot of things in this game lol)"
Not a big fan of the P90 personally. I don�t know why I just don�t like it. Funny clip tho m8
What is this map
Superstore lmao
Imagine winning gunfight while using dead silence
This was Hardcore TDM...
"while the levels for guns are across all three, camos and reticles are exclusive to each game, so if you get the reticle for the variable zoom on a cold war gun, it doesn�t transition to modern warfare�s version of the scope."
"But how do i then get these required kills for the axial armx 3x, resp. the royal kross 4x?

Doesnt work with Kar98 Var.Zoom, or with HDR Var. Zoom-Scope.

somehow i have 22 resp. 8 of the required Kills allready. But i have no clue how i got them and they don't progress further with kills with the above mentioned weapons (at least in Plunder)"
"You not the only one having this issue.  I am trying to unlock reticles on this axial 3x scope as well.  It says I have 68 of 100 kills yet according to pj1170 there it�s not cross capable.  Not sure of this answer as I don�t have any Black Ops weapons upgraded to attach a Variable Zoom scope.  So, where did the 68 kills come from?  I have tried the variable zoom on various MW weapons but not tacking onto the 68 kills now.  With no BO weapons leveled up to use a variable zoom scope where did the 68 kills come from and how do I get the next 32?  Guess I have to grind up a BO rifle now."
"Testing things out and reading elsewhere, I did find out that you can just use the axial 3x scope and it will count towards the kill count.  I just used it in a plunder match and got 5 kills off it with a low level gun and they counted towards the end goal.  Hope this help you as well."
"My calling card/emblem weren�t set to random, but I tried changing them anyway. No fix. I get placed in a lobby, watch the whole countdown, see the loading screen for the match and then it just completely crashes."
How dare someone play the game differently than you do.
Infinite claymores shouldnt be a thing.
Its not about playing the game differently. My point flew over yo lil head.
[removed]
U already had it be4
"Da??? I'm sorry, I don't speak idiot."
Aw somebody upset they cant foot fairy around my corner of the map. Use spotter.

Yep.
For most people. Still a bunch of other issues but it wouldn't be CoD without them ;)
"WTF!? I have never played DOM on that map and I get offered that map at least 3 times a session/day with DOM always selected in the quick play filter. You'll be telling me it's in the Hardpoint rotation next! :/

Edit - Watched it again and it's not DOM. It's the new mode Reinforce isn't it? I shall have to try it. Finally a good reason for that map."
Ground War. Massive game of Dom
"Nah it's Ground War. Basically 5 flag domination with more players (in this case 48)

But do try reinforce. It's very very good"
looove the model 680. super satisfying to use even if its not the best shotgun in the class
lmfao did i just see sleight of hand 20 round mag
Jesus I want to know both of those loadouts
"The Val is VLK 200 mm barrel, tac laser, VLK strelok stock, commando for grip, and possibly stipples grip tape from the looks.

Edit: not sure with the 680"
"The shotgun is the 680 with the Marauder suppressor, Liberator barrel, 5 mW laser, and no stock.

I can�t tell if he�s using an underbarrel or tube extension"
M60 will always be my favorite
Shotgun loadout?
The 680 just slaps so hard.  I fucken love it.  Kit it out for range and mobility and just sprint around taking scalps.
In groundwar are there still the port maps?
Laughs in 12 gauge.

"I�ve got my I5 9600K just under 5ghz with no issues. 

That�s not to say that I didn�t experience issues along the way.

Guessing your voltage is too low. Overclocking doesn�t make a lot of sense if you�re not someone who likes diagnosing issues and tweaking."
10700k overclock 5.3 runs just fine
"what kind of voltage do you have set for an OC like that? i got mine at 1.3 for a 10900k @ 5.2. i have had 2 black screen total PC reboots playing warzone, but i cant replicate it always so not to sure if its just a voltage thing, all my temps are fine."

I was just watching Tim's stream and he was having that issue. He tried everything he could think of too. He can play the game just not edit anything.
"I never tried to actually play, I'll have to see if it works without going into the loadouts. Thanks for the heads up..

Edit: Just loaded up and tried quick play and the game just froze gotta love the week before the new season; all sorts of new glitches to fix. lol"

"Im in Michigan. Not entirely sure where the servers are, but Id imagine they arent here lol"
Yeah MW likes to give you hella lag on some games. I hear the game makes you lag to balance out sbmm. So when I start to lag i just die a few times then the lag is mostly gone for me the next game. ik it�s weird but it works for me lol
Honestly would make sense lol. I did like a 2.6 kd in a game then the next game I was lagging all over and finished with like a .7
"I have 35, and it's still a laggy mess"
"Lol I play on 50 in mp, and 80 in warzone. I never think I'm lagging but could be the fact that I'm used to it"

"Custom games with friends on mw is the best, Cold War doesn�t have that touch that mw has"
"On the title screen with Cold War, Warzone and MW showing it usually says for MW �Purchase�. If I click multiplayer on Cold War and then back out once I�m logged in, bizarrely it shows that I own MW (I do) and Purchase disappears showing me campaign, multiplayer and coop. I�ll then click multiplayer and it takes me to everything that�s installed, which is pretty much everything except Cold War campaign as I�ve completed it. 

Multiplayer 2 and 3 are there and installed but 1 does not show. 

I�ve been to the store, but it doesn�t show individual packs on PS5, I�ve clicked �Information� but but that doesn�t show packs, I�ve searched the store, for the exact title without joy.

I�ve googled it and seen a few suggestions as this issue seems very common, and they range from unplug for five mins, reset MAC address (I can�t find instructions on how to do this on PS5 as it�s very different to PS4), uninstalled it all and reinstalled it all, logged in/out, all without success. 

I�ve checked I�m logged in to MW with my activision account and I am. 

Once I leave the MW section it then returns to �Purchase� for the game, even though I can start it easily from my games library. I think I actually got the game as a PS Plus member a year or so ago. I even tried loading MW2 to see if it helped,  it it didn�t� I�m the only user on the PS5�

Any help would be appreciated."

"Not everything shows in the armoury 

It rotates as well but no idea when 

I know the main store is daily"
They keep doing this shit with other bundles. I think they update it weekly but not entirely sure. My suggestion is to just check it daily. That�s what I�ve been doing but no luck for another bundle I�ve been wanting to get.
You'd think that they would allow you to buy any bundle when you want. You know to make more money
"If your accuracy is on point it's really good, but if you miss the first quick burst it becomes a peashooter for me..."
Even with good accuracy it sucks. it becomes a pain in the ass when multiple people push you at once
It's OK just don't main it
I�ll switch on and off using it but it can fucking melt if you�re accurate. I�ve taken it on rush routes and beat out quite a few people using meta guns. Then again I love using different weapons and set ups because I�m not a sweaty nerd but that�s just me
its my favorite gun in the game. its hard to use but very satisfying to master
"Me but only recent. Not everyones cup of tea.

Problem.is that it needs extra attachments just to perform like a normal ar, but that takes away from ads reduction, extra ammo, and sight, since irons are terrible compared to other ars."
I didn't even know when I unlocked it. But I tried it out a few times and i seem to do well with it. For now it's my goto but I like to dick around with dumb weapons/ attachments so I probably won't use it very long
"The key is to tap the trigger, not hold it, so it just keeps bursting. It has an absurd fire rate if you do that"
"you won't shoot faster like that, it's not worth doing that at all. Just try dumping a mag and stopping time. No significant difference between bursting and fullauto"

Since then I started using it for about 50-100 meters fights and loved it, it has very good aim and it's very controlable imo. But I always used it on bursts, and for cqc I used an MP7"
Usually i run it in ground war. Sometimes switch to 2 round burst if i have to take a long shot.
I don�t main it but it�s def a gun I come back to every once and awhile
"An94 is great, just hit first shot"
"At least in HC modes, it's trash compared to anything that can consistently one-hit."
It�s fun to use but I don�t like how it sounds with the suppressor.
"with the right attachments its a pretty awesome gun, especially that 60 casket rounds clip.

Sila barrely with the sonic brake 60 round casket mag, Zero Mini Reflex and a tac laser and its a beast.

If you're worried about recoil use the 438MM barrel with commando foregrip throw the Pero stock on it

weapon is good for quick head shots"
Yeah that's been my go to lately and it's been killing it
"I like using it in burst fire mode, it usually two-three bursts people and the recoil feels much less random"
"Just dont have any desire to use it when things like the m4, amax, val and such are available"
Those were fun for the first week until me brain melted of over powered boredom. I don�t understand people who still use this guns a year into this games life cycle. Sorry if I sound salty it�s not personal too you. Off meta is just so much more fun unless I�m getting stomped. In that case I get pissed and vent on reddit
The only time to use that gun is in HC game modes.
Needs ads and mobility buff to compete
Dude almost you died. Nice reaction.
Go play the objective
Nah fam
That is actually awesome. I wish more vehicle encounters were like this.
It made me die of laughter while also making me infuriated at the same time.
This was like if vin diesel decided to play Warzone and used his primary weapon from all the fast and furious movies.
"As someone who grew up playing twisted metal, CoD and Halo, this was a dream. This game has given us a large playground to experience the highs and lows of chance in game play. I love this!"
I really wish Twisted metal was remade with gta graphics.
Fast And The Furious: Warzone Edition
You have no idea my guy one night my buddy land on his load out but clips a tree and gets downed and then my other buddy reverses a car and it some how flips and kicks him out and crushes him. Edit: both died
Afterthought: I noticed my voice is oddly high in this video and that�s just because it gets like that when i�m excited or laughing. I apologize if it bothers anyone.
"Your voice is fine, if anyone talked shit fuck em. That�s what you sounds like when you are happy and having a good time. That�s your sound of happiness and if anyone says something that�s something wrong with them, not you."
I think you should upload it on r/CODWarzone as mods can remove warzone posts . Nice clip BTW!
"This is awesome, not stupid"
Looks like something that would happen in a Fast and Furious movie
Fast and furious lookin headass
This is probably the most realistic car encounter i�ve seen in this game.
That distance between you can the car was another fricken car lmao
Really looked like you were gonna clear under the suv
Woooooow
"The disappointment of the guy that landed his helicopter on top of mine yesterday to kill me, and I just flew off and he died in a blaze of glory :D"
Nice to see Warzone taking creative directions from Burnout Paradise
Trailer worthy

One of you guys sounds like dream lol
"""Shit! They got away. Well, Fuck you then"""
Some movie shit right here.
I hate how vehicles seem to have an extra invisible barrier around them that insta kills
Am I the only one who has extreme lag when trying to rename loudouts on Xbox? Like the thumb stick keyboard has a 4 second delay per letter making typing a nightmare
Yeah I've had that for a while
Clan tag too.
Lmao I can�t even get XP in Activision�s beloved Warzone. They broke that too when they added rumble which is based on MP.
It's been like that since launch for me. It's not getting fixed
Your gaming chair needs a software update.
"I always thought he'd be an operator or something. Could give him his iconic look, follow by some fictional looks with tac gear and helmet with nods. But it definitely would have been an interesting skin to join the  Shadow Company."
They will most likely put an operator in for cold war as a promotion for mw2.
That would be cool but I�d rather have the ghost UDT skin
i could see him being a battle pass operator for the next MW2
There was 1 quick scope in the entire video...
That�s correct.
I think you'll be fine buying it now. I don't like cold war at all so I still play modern warfare and the lobbies still fill up easily. Seems to be a few more sweats though
You�ll still have fun. It�s a very good game in my opinion and I like it better than Cold War the only thing is you won�t really earn anything. The battle pass in mw is the same on in Cold War so you�ll only earn the Cold War stuff my playing mw which is stupid but you can unlock all the dlc weapons and stuff you just won�t get the satisfaction of earning something to play with bc again you only have stuff to earn for the Cold War game.
Sorry if you meant something else but Dlc guns are unblockable. Like to unlock Holger you need longshot kills with lmgs and for Striker you need to get smg kills while sliding.
If the alternative it playing black ops MW is definitely still worth buying.
"It is the funniest, jankiest, most chaotic and bullshit game I've ever played. 10/10 I play every day and I have like 1,000 hours in it lol."

"The lag has been unreal the past couple of weeks, really makes the game unplayable"
FACTS. This shit happens before im about to get a kill too. It�s almost like it�s intentional
This guy knifed me twice so I assassinated he after that and I was about to do it again
"My shiternet has been doing this to me for years, albeit not to this extent."
My friends call it quick silver mode
"I remember when my internet was like this, thank god Ethernet cables exist"
"For real man, I only gave it a shot 3 nights ago, waiting for my friend to play it today only to find out it's already gone.  
Why make it last less than a week? They are really destroying this game."
Yeah the tournament is a lot of fun. Regret not having won the final before it was taken away. Made it to the semi final and ran into players with Faze skins. You know how that turned out.
Why only remove it after a couple days it should be Permanent is there anyone to contact as to why it was removed
"I know they usually stay for a week before they�re gone but this one seemed to be around a lot shorter, this is the only one I didn�t get to win since the first one that happened last year."

"Made this as a send off to the boys before they shipped out to Cold War. But as it turns out, that game was butt cheeks so they came back we still terrorize the East Coast servers from time to time.

Sorry if this is a bit too inside-jokey, still felt that some people would still enjoy it"
The real free bundle was the friends we made along the way
Haha yeah... I've managed to get rid of that in MW but it persists in WZ & CW. Whoever is heading up their UX & QA teams needs firing :D
How does this level of ignorance get a pass in their company?
"I had to scroll horizontally on one of the rows to get one last week. Never seen it before then. Might be the issue here, might not."
Check the armoury
Im having the same problem
Same issue
Similar problem I have been unusually laggy recently (about the last 3-5 days). Unfortunately I have no assistance to offer
Clenched so hard you farted diamond dust after creating a small vacuum via the astronomical PSI & Speed of said clench.
"Same thing happened with the Sykov. It's there but hasn't been launched yet (I think it's season 2 material or so) and when it's launched it should be available. The Sykov, for instance, is only available in MW survival mode and I've had it once or twice in WZ gulag."
Most of them are cold war side unlocked and only a few for warzone only so you can't get them into multi. Buying the season pass for MW just to find out you're unlocking stuff for a game you don't/or do own..
I remember there was a guy in this sub crying about how broken this is lol. More broken than amped shield + shottys?
Do you have a link to the post or is it super old?
Is it more broken than as val and spr combo?
"Don�t get the hate for shotgun though. It�s a weapon, it�s an option there. People whining about it just puzzles me."
I fucking love my crossbow
"Hated getting longshots with it, but once I got it gold, it felt soooooooo good. Now I just vibe and play it with however I please, and it�s a lot of fun!"
ya one of my first obsidians
I fucking love my crossbow
I agree so hard
hate the look of it but I appreciate its existence
"they set themselves up lol i hate when ppl do that in my s&d lobbies..... Like we could have had a fun game but u chose to piss me off ""it hurt me more than it hurt u"""
"Main reason I stopped playing, at some point you hit a threshold where you're no longer being matchmaker against players that are good, but players who cheese the hell out of the game"
I did this with a few people and it was the most fun I�d had playing in ages.
"The explosive crossbow is the only any-body-part-one-hit-down weapon in mw and wz. Same for thermite bolts in mw. You can hit someone in the toe and they drop.

It�s such an underrated weapon. Had plenty of success with it all around.

I think if it like having up to 40 exploding throwing knives that fire and travel faster. Once you look at it like that, it all makes sense.

Sleight of hand is mandatory though."
Except you will most likey get killed before the arrow explodes. Its super weak in multiplayer.
Wait knifes aren�t one hit anywhere?
Explosive Bow is my go-to class in WZ. Once you learn the drop it�s a great weapon at range. Useful as anti-vehicle too cause most people don�t realize how much damage it does and doesn�t get cancelled by trophies.

"Try the Thermite underbarrel launchers, great for when you just need to quickly counter a shield in a match."
"xbow should've been a secondary, then these kinds of plays would be much more convenient."
"Then there would be zero risk for running a crossbow, resulting in crossbow plays becoming unimpressive."
SND lobbies have gotten so bad these past weeks. Every lobby is full of people camping at the back of spawn proned in a corner or people running shotgun + riot shield.
I also love my crossbow :)
"Whoa, didn't know you could do that to the shield with the blowing dart"
Justice
i dont play CoD but that looks annoying to deal with lol
The shields or the crossbow?
It's literally the easiest thing to counter.
�i�m a pussy and i use riot shield�
I like how your class just doesn�t have any form of bullet at all
"My days, this is my dream, bow is my primary choice, I get so excited when I see the enemy with their silly doors that they think keep them safe. 
You struck gold with this one. Good shots too"
Are explosive bolts always 1 shot on riot shields?
Yes
"My favorite thing is when I use the riot shield (I main it) and the other team gets so pissed they all switch to riot shield shotgun, to which I then switch to the riot shield crossbow combo. It�s called being a dick and I enjoy it"
I dont get why people get so mad though but at the same time say it's so easy to kill a shield lol. I mess around with a Riot Shield and a Javelin too so I don't see why they complain so much
I mean yeah... I think the crossbow it the most fun out of the counters for shields
Man they are some toxic ass cunts
Doing god's work son
I clutched a game done 5 rounds because they didn�t realize this is how crossbows work. They were nice guys I explained it to them at the end
"Lmao just a day ago I was versing an entire team of riot shield knifers when I was using a crossbow. Let's just say it was the most fun crossbow match I've had so far. (Funny thing was that they were getting super tilted calling me dogshit for using a crossbow saying it takes no skill, as they hide behind indestructible walls)"
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
You a real one for this! Fuck the riot shield and 725
Karma
This is why I love the crossbow
I gotta start playing SND. I�ve seen enough bot lobbies on here to not join
SND makes the kills way more satisfying as they usually have mics on
Molotov cocktails are also very effective.
"Whenever I see MW gameplays only one thought strikes my mind..... ""How weird men walk"""
If the old halo lobbies were recorded half of us 90�s babies would be excommunicated lol. BRUTAL.
".......Alexander the Great was Macedonian, the king actually."
had to google that lol. didn't know that was the case
Yes but modern �Macedonians� are not related to ancient Macedonians. They�re Slavs. Still inaccurate on the rager�s part lol
Love that. (Shit)talking makes the game at least 50 % more fun. Too bad nobody talks in TDM etc.
You can get it in S&D but it�s nothing like that MW2
These are gold XD
thanks brah might make this an ongoing thing on this sub
"a yes, the ausie shit talking god has returned."
more on the way dw
Omds I love Australians. I would live there if it wasn't for the spiders
you might wanna live here for the free healthcare and the welfare system
Typical wogs.
Argueing whether Alexander The Great was Greek or Macedonian. All the fucking time. -_-
The ferret bit had me dying
"If you don't have the accuracy or reflexes to outgun other players, your only real option is to play more conservatively and trying to use strategy and positioning to win. CoD is still a game that prioritizes twitch reflexes and accuracy above all else, so if you're worse than your peers, you have to make up for it elsewhere.

Try using cover and moving from cover to cover instead of running around aimlessly like most people do online."
"What tips do you have about twitch reflexes? Accuracy I'm good at but I don't know how to improve on twitch reflexes. You defo know what youre talking about, any help would be appreciated. Thanks man"
"Learn the maps, and hold chokepoints. Play hardpoint and play the objective, you'll get into a lot more cqc fights which will improve your awareness etc over time with experience"
Read the ranger handbook and play like a ranger
I don't know what you're talking about??
Same.problem here....dont have a solution yet
"I like using the ZLR Asp, spr 28mm scope, 208 blitz, feather bolt and .338 mags. Not sure if it�s the best but it�s pretty fast"
For the best damage use the lapua mag
"Typical meta SPR quickscope build is:

- Sniper Scope

- ZLR Asp barrel (short barrel)

- 338 Lapua ammo

- XRK Blitz stock 

- Tac Laser 


The scope for obvious reasons.

The short barrel for ADS & movement speed buffs, unfortunately it drastically hurts the Bullet velocity & 1-shot-kill damage range which is why we use the 338 ammo.

338 improves velocity & damage range lost by the barrel to effectively counter the losses. It also adds a 1-shot-kill area to the stomach within 20m or so. 

XRK Blitz stock for ADS & Strafe, movement & sprint to fire speed buff. Unfortunately it adds a lot of wobble to the idle sway. 

That�s where the Tac laser comes in to negate the idle sway & further improve ADS time. 

Overall the gun is just faster in every way, although the Fire rate is slightly slower due to the 338. 



Alternatively if your aim is pretty accurate and you can reliably hit thoes upperchest and head shots, much like a good Kar98 user. Just drop the 338 ammo. Put on the feather bolt."
"Idk if I could ever use the SPR with a full quickscope set up, even without attachments it just feels...dirty."
"I�m at 16,000+ kills with 0.51 accuracy and obsidian....

...and i personally prefer XRK Dragoon, Tac Laser, XRK Ultimate, .338 Lapua, Sloan Feather

Do not aim. Just trust the ADS aim assist and pull the trigger. If you�re aiming down for longer than 1/4 second, pull back out and ADS again. 

Good luck.

Edit: yes the dragoon is slower, but the suppressor aspect is invaluable as the SPR is loud and will def give away your position after one shot without it."
You don't need a suppressor if you don't plan to stay in the same window the whole game.
Ax50
That�s actually impressive seeing as this gun is dog shit only thing worse is the dragunov
Thanks:)
"Do you know what is not cool? the motion blur, turn it off."
Nah motion blur is cool. It's personal preference tho :)
There�s only one answer here if you answered the other way go to hell
[deleted]
What day is it playlists update again?
today i think 6pm gmt
Need it for M4A1 + MP5 gold
I would pay for it. Hopefully it will return this week. Not having Shoot the Ship available is so frustrating and depressing.
Same. Feel lost without it when playing
At this point 75% of the community wants it they need to just implement it into the game as a playlist.. the game is past it�s prime anyway. If they integrate the stupid fucking battle pass we probably would have gotten shipment 24/7 like we have with the past several cod games prior to this (blops 4 got nuketown) but in all honesty as long as the games are integrated we will never get a permanent playlist.
I'm afraid you're right..
I also did it in one day yesterday
The audio is loud. Idk what caused this to happen but headphone warning. I'm sorry.
Wait until the sykov releases
I�ve been grinding it in spec opps the thing is a beast
"Haha I went through this same exact process, including realizing that it wasn't a 3 round burst gun by default, 8 months ago. 

By the way... that was before they nerfed the renetti. It was the meta for a couple months and they nerfed it hard - and it's still good."
laughs in sykov unlock
Whats that?
I�m going for obsidian on it and it just takes so much time but will still probably be able easier than getting good on the 1911 geez that gun sucks
1911 is my third favorite after the m19 and renetti. Just put a lightweight trigger and you�ll be good. It packs a heavy punch
Awesome. Now time to move on the the impossible to unlock bruen and amax.

Yes always. Idk if its a setting. Try to look for it mate!
"This was posted a lot of times, you need to buy a store Vault pack to access those missions. This pack will give you the first operator of the three and the possibility to unlock the remaining 2 via those challenges (just like when you unlock the operator via BP, it will give you the first one and you need to unlock the other skins playing).

The fact that the missions are showing is a bug.
If you want to check these vault operator packs, go to Codtracker and look at S1 bundles in the database."
Those available operator missions are not meant to be accessible for players. They're likely only visible because of the upcoming season 1 vault bundles.
Did IW said that there will be coming s1 vault bundles?
You probably have to buy one of the new packs from the store - here is the one with wyatt: https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/bundles/400170-warcom-pack

"Nice, good shit!"
"Unpopular opinion, Damascus doesn't look that bad, although I could be slightly biased about it"
Ah yes the unlimited range shotguns.
"Very nice indeed. They should have just skipped Cold War and kept putting their resources in to Modern Warfare. Excellent title. Nice clip of the kills there buds, loved the jump shot at the end."
I�d be impressed if you had a scope on that lmao
"hmmmm... weird, my enemy whenever i play is quicker, more aware, and more deadly than yours, hmm i wonder why, hmmmm"
Nice clip.
How quickly you can kill with these weapons is ridiculous sometimes.
If you miss ur dead tho. It rewards skill and precision.
I didn�t think MW had a free upgrade to next gen only Cold War. So you probably do have to buy it again
"Fuck me, that didn't even cross my mind! I appreciate it."
"You would think it would be backwards compatible. As in I have my PS4 version i can play on PS5. 

Is there and option to choose which version to play? as in PS5 i can select to play either PS4 version of a game or PS5 if there is upgraded version"
At any point did you restart your PC?
multiple times
Forced obsoletion
How stupid is it hey? I hate cold war and don't want to play it because it is so unbalanced and runs like garbage on my PS5.
I completely stopped playing because of this. Probably won�t return even after it�s fixed now tbh.
"Same here, I am not levelling up at all on Modern Warfare. I thought they had fixed this issue but I guess not."

"All the Shoties sligthly are UP, esp on bigger maps"
"That�s a very interesting take! One shot potential (the concept, not of the specific weapons) is a huge deal. I definitely agree shotguns are useless on certain maps or game modes. But I�m a hardpoint boy, and they can *clean up* on the right maps. Sometimes I find them a bit annoying, but it does balance out with the times you become a hitmarker factory."

thx
Imagine running a game that literally only half works. There has never been a year old cod this fucking broken it's disgusting.
"Yep.  Their last patch a few weeks ago broke the game and they don�t seem to care about fixing it.  They pushed out a hot fix a few days ago but it didn�t fix the XP leveling bug which still exists.

I�m on PS4.  Bought the game last week on a PS Store sale.  I�m stuck at level 1.  I�m out of luck on a return because of Sony�s restrictions on digital downloads even though half the game doesn�t work.  If it wasn�t so damn big I would delete it off my hard drive and wait for a fix before reinstalling it but don�t particularly want my PS4 tied up for hours while the thing redownloads."
"Must be a way we can get refunds I am playing on a PS5 so have the same issues as it's the PS4 version.

I am not a huge fan of Warzone as its seems like big brother of fortnite in my opinion. 

They don't seem to be interested in fixing this and more than likely it wont be fixed any time soon.

It's a shame since 99% of the game is now focused towards Cold War(Gamepass etc) 
feels like a bit of a ploy to get us to buy cold war by slowly taking things away like xp like it's some bug and battlepass for unlocking stuff in another game which I dont own. 

Does anyone have any suggestions how to realistically get my money back and raise a complaint? I wish there was a game regulatory board that would stop this kind of thing. 

I live in the uk so would trading standards be a plausible route?"
"Yeah, that sucks. I'm also stuck on level 1 because of the season change. Sadly it seems like a majority of players only play on warzone, and don't seem to have the problem of the whole leveling bug, there isn't as much draw back or complaining by the majority of the community that makes Activision get off their ass and fix their game."
"I�m stuck too. Haven�t played in like half a year, came back and can�t level up my guns or my ranking"
"I cant even play the fucking game, it freezes when i click ""quick play"" on multiplayer"
Ohh really? It isn't that bad for me...
oh my god please dont tell me i cant get weapon xp anymore...
"Weapon XP is fine for me, player XP isn�t working though."
\*ahem\* it seems like you can't. (unless activision gets off their ass and fixes the game).
"Im just having an audio glitch now, super crunchy and gun shots don�t make sounds till like 5 seconds later"
Happens every 2-3 games then I have to hard reset my Xbox to fix it
Having the same problem. I'm only getting xp on cold war
Anyone has problems with Battle pass not leveling properly?
Had this problem since the last update. Only today has it started working and I�ve managed to grab some xp
"This is stupid! First I get perma-banned on my main account, you can find the reddit post linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lf9v08/why_am_i_being_punished/). So I spin up an entire new PSN account and now I can't even earn XP in  multiplayer game modes! You can only earn XP while playing WarZone but  its minimal at best!

My game wouldn't install shaders for the first two and a half seasons and now they're charging ridiculous prices for stuff I could have got from playing the damn game along with everyone else. Personally I try and get as many blueprints as possible to play with gunsmith customs and the like so this isn't a case of just get the ones u want - are any of the bundles worth it at their current pricing? I don't think the CW integration was well conceived or executed, but they could have cycled the old battle passes back in in parallel with the cw one, or one after the other. If u could choose which one u started first u could keep MW and CW players happy. This is lazy and greedy. Activision touted the battle pass as their biggest free content drops but this is hardly in the same spirit. Not really sure what I can do about it, they seem to do what they like but oh well."
Literally 18000 CP for something that u could get with a 300cp profit

"Looks cool man, that�s a useful skill you�re developing"
Must be nice to get ship
It really was. I wish they�d just make shipment and shoot house permanent. Doesn�t make sense why it isn�t. Cold War has nuke town 24/7 bc that�s all anyone wants to play
"Uh, three throwing knife kills is 'popping off'???????

Dudes that play spawn modes really are a different breed, huh"
This is the 538th topic this week asking the same question. You�re not alone. Welcome to the club. Enjoy your stay.
Ight lmao I don�t mind it it�s just confusing
"My battle pass levels up, but my level does not. Your best bet, play Warzone 'till you level up enough to at least have everything unlocked."
I already do an just confused by it is all my level reset since I have not played a few last seasons
"I got two gold camos (AX-50 & SP-R), my level is still 26 lol. I wanna play with the MP7!!!!"
"you get the cod points back as you complete the battle pass, worst case you've got cold war blueprints and skins for warzone"
Well... The worst part is I barely played this season hahaha
The exact same thing happened to me. I was pissed
"Obviously that�s the real purpose of these Ads on Modern Warfare...to annoy and increase these kind of accidents to happen.

I hope the maker of ads dies painfully."
"it happens, but look on the bright side. It's just $10 and you get 1200 credits if you level up to the max."
"there are exactly 1000 points to be earned by buying it, the rest of the cod points is in free tiers that you get regardless."
Nice play
I'm angry on you behalf that your death was by kali sticks.

"I have NEVER had this mission work, tried over 100 times.  I even sent an email to them and no response."
"Yes. 
For future reference you can always move it to another drive and have it discover the files. It will save time and bandwidth :)"
"Thanks. The Battlenet game launcher did not recognize the game in the C: drive and the uninstaller didn't work :(

"People sleep on the uzi. I love it, one of my favourites."
"If it had a larger mag size for those 41 AE mags everyone would use it, but I'm kinda glad it's still 32 rounds per mag, makes it much more difficult to use, makes you think if you can spare a couple more bullets to kill someone, switch to your other gun, or have enough time to reload. You have to be pragmatic in order to successfully use that loadout for the uzi, which makes it so much fun to use for the challenge"
One of my favorite guns for SnD and WarZone :3
man i don�t sleep on it i got that thing obsidian i knew once i got the right setup it was godly imo
I've been playing for a year & haven't tried it yet. Is it easy to pick up?
That's a nasty clip! Cheers for sharing
I do remember seeing points awarded for kills I had no way of making.  Today I just got the Finger Flicker achievement for absolutely no reason.
Oh no I was just talking about your air streak getting shot down and landing on you lmao

Hasn�t fixed for me yet
Yeah mine still wasn't working as of about 4pm central
Not for me yet. Just weapon XP works as intended.
Still no rank xp. Total bullshit
"...I got a free weapon xp token, does that count?"
"Yes, since Friday (or Thursday)"
For some ppl mine still isn�t fixed
Sweet! Thanks
Seems like its a 50/50. I personnaly get XP again. Some don't. Ho and there is also the category of people that get SOME xp. Kind of sad for new players.
I get like 500 exp every game. I played 8 hours straight yesterday and i got up 2 whole lvls thats ridiculous.
I am still not levelling up. Some players seem to be fine with the XP but me and many others are still left in the dark with this XP bug.
The glitch doesnt affect everyone. I havent noticed anything people have been complaining about for the past few weeks. Although that doesnt mean activision is somehow doing good
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
"That's kinda just the natural order of Rust. Its tiny and open. I'll explode randomly for a few seconds, but its always fun."
An easier way is to set your crouch and slide key to the change stance/slide option. You only have to double-tap the crouch key
"If you map sprint to a button, you can also do it by holding sprint, slide, ads. Prevents accidentally jumps and is faster and more accurate into the ads. Perfect method for going into headglitches"
"i mapped my shift key just for tac sprint.

i slide with C and cancel right after with c again and press shift again to tac sprint with no delay since it's only mapped for tac sprint"
"hey how did you map your shift key to tac sprint? is it a keybind?

&#x200B;

edit: nvm homie just found it. love you for commenting this. didnt know it was a thing. always had to double/triple press shift and hold it for tac sprint.

what did you map your steady aim sniper button to?"
"You can slide cancel by aiming, too."
"With ads it's so much slower tho, not an effective way to do"
Post this on a wz sub
Maybe cause you don�t own cold war
"can�t be it, i�m level 350 and own/played cold war and it�s the same for me"
Yes but the website is so horrible.
"It�s so bad I know. Guess I�ll keep trying, thanks!"
"I had the same problem. My solution was to re-add another Google Authenticator profile to the Google A app. Just scan the barcode again or insert the number a second time while you have the first one already registered and use the code of the most recent one. If it works, delete the old one."
"I�ll give this a try, thank you!"
"Download an app called ""Authy"" It's much better than the Google authenticator one."
"This worked, thank you"
"I had trouble setting up mine a few days ago, tried changing my password and tried again by using the manual code setup Instead of the qr code scan. Worked like a charm."
You have to download the app it says to use which generates a code.  I believe it says google Authenticator.  Ran into the same problem when I enabled it.
"Have had terrible quality since last update on ps4 and has made my whole console act up, won�t restart when I lag out or power off etc."
"That�s hilarious. Mind as well tell PC players not to post highlights either, because it�s not skill, there�s just so much you can do on pc it isn�t impressive"
You know what they call MKB with aim assist? lolol I'll let you answer that if you know..
Real hand eye coordination is always more impressive than something that automatically does the hard parts for you. Like a car that self parks... is a shitty driver that can't park considered great at parking because their car auto parks? lol
Muh PC master race
"Not even about that, I know plenty of beast controller players that don't need aim assist."
"What a salty little cry baby you are to write this.  Somebody clapped your little cheeks and in your mind your the best player ever, so whoever killed you had to have had aim assist and wouldn't have whooped your ass without it right?  Lol. Get real dude."
"More assumptions.. I wrote this after playing with a controller to see how well the aim assist works. Like I said, Through walls, doors, smoke, flash and stun nades.. You're not seeing how that is weak and unbalanced for a competitive game?? lol ffs people are dense af.

never once did I say I was the best at anything, and never once did I say I lose or win any fights vs aim assist or not, you're assuming more. Also, it's not a matter of that... It's about real skill vs automatic mechanics to aid beginners on controllers, not for people who are already good without aim assist you schmuck.. lol this OP went over your head, and turned you just as salty as me about this content. GuD JoB BrO BuD"
"aim assist  simulates the thing that your wrist does, since you cant move a stick with your wrist"
"No, it simulates auto aim. Through walls, doors, and smoke, and even flash/stun nades. lol"
There are cars that auto park for those who can't park well on their own. Do we still call them good drivers if they have a mechanic that auto parks? lol no...
Either way... You all have 0 merit when it comes to skill when you're using aim assist and try to post it here like it's all you XD lolol I just find it hilarious is all..
"CoD players will cry about anything except aim assist... You use a gun? (Insert gun name here) noob.... doesn't even matter what gun you use, just listen to the voice chat when a match is over... NONE of you guys are ever in good spirits and just feel constantly attacked. top it off with using aim assist and still getting pooped on and it's just 100% nerd rage, 100% of the time.... You use 725!?!?!?! HOW DARE YOU!!! XD ffs it's just sad is all :/"
TIL cod is not about positioning and map awareness and instead it is about aim
"I never understood the hate for aim assist. You guys have a point and shoot input device lol

I did my snipers/marksman plat on M&K because it was easy. Let�s not even talk about how M&K can do a 180 in a millisecond"
"At least that's real aiming.. MKB is all on the user to have hand eye coordination. the very thing aim assist eliminates the need for. That's why people hate on it. it's literally a mechanic that AUTO aims for users who are starting off on controllers. Not for people who are already good with it... Also, there is a button on the controller that auto 180 turns lol so..."
"You are really misinformed are you, console turn faster than Mouse on the same sens. This is fact, one is moving just the joystick with a finger, one is moving the entire arms."
Its happening to me too. I'm playing multiplayer split screen on PS4 and it crashes all the time with the same error code.
"That's exactly how I'm playing too- multiplayer split screen on PS4. I can't even get a full game in most times. I've tried restarting the game and restarting the PS4 several times and it doesn't help. Also, happy cake day :)"
"Yeah, my lady and I like to play together but can�t get more than a match out of at all because of this error. First it�ll crash and take me back to the Home Screen, then the next time it�ll crash it�ll take me back to the Home Screen sometimes paired with Dev error 5476 and the Home Screen will be unresponsive for about 20 seconds. It�s really annoying, I hope it�s fixed soon. I also hope it�s not overlooked because it seems like a split screen issue."
"Yeah my bf and I play split screen as well. I haven't tried playing solo in multiplayer yet but someone else said they're having the issue w Warzone. I also haven't tried playing Campaign since it's been happening but that'll prob work fine. Ugh, so frustrating. Thank you for letting me know it's happening to you also though bc I was feeling p helpless lol"
"Been having the same problem for about a month aswell. Can play maximum 2 games on MP split screen, then crash again. The only game we are actually playing at home. Such a shame."
these folks  would mess up a peanut butter sandwitch.. eevry update has an issue
"This still wasn't fixed with the new update,  it's bullshit."
"Same thing. Been happening since the update. Every couple of games it crashes. 
Once it froze my whole ps4 when trying to get the error code data. Had to hold power button to turn it off.."
"Yup, since the update. That mf update took a WHILE to download too. -_- How does this sorta thing happen?? Like it was working fine before lol:("
"I had the same issue, spoke with PlayStation support and was given a solution that has resolved the issues thus far:

While the modern warfare app is closed, go to settings, network, and turn off connect to internet. Then open the mw app, once the app is launched (before selecting �go online� or �retry�) go back to settings and turn on connect to internet. 

Since doing this the game hasn�t crashed during split spleen online play.

Hope this works for others!"
"I�m having the same problem, tried this and didn�t help."
"Okay, thank you for this! I'll try it in a bit when I get on to play and I'll lyk how it goes!"
"Only thing that helps with me is if I play a couple of games by myself then add the Mrs in for split screen. It will work for a few games then start doing it again. The other day I played about 10 games by myself in the morning then the mrs came on it in the afternoon for some split screen and we had no issues for a while. I have reported it to activision and playstation countless times.
There is a way you can see through your error history and the amount of times I have had this code in one week is silly.

Dont bother watching the youtube videos saying rebuild database, initialise, delete trophy history, uninstall etc etc it's all a waste of time. I really wanted to find a fix for this and will continue to try but I genuinely believe there is nothing we can do other than hope for a patch on the updates through activison and playstation platforms.

If anyone else fixes please let me know.

Regards"
This shit worked fine for me and my wife until the update. What ever the hell they put in the patch messed up the game. I am also in the rabbit hole of logging in first to get a few kills and then she joins and sometimes we get about 5 rounds in and sometimes we just go back to b03 because we get pissed. Btw wtf did they combine Cold Sore with Modern warfare. That is just bullshit.
Please let me know if you find something too! We've been trying everything!!
"Same thing here we can never get 2 matches in before blue screen of death. 
I�ve tried deleting and reinstalling the game(takes 3 hours at least) to no avail. Really hope they fix this as we play splitscreen daily and it�s incredibly frustrating�been happening since February."
I have it too a lot. Its an issue in WZ too so yeah prolly a bug ingame
Dude it's so annoying. I literally can't play a full multiplayer match without it crashing
"Same here, been trying to play split screen on PS4 and it's been broken since about the 4th"
Ugh. Have you found anything that helps it a little? Or are we p much SOL until they fix it?
"Solo multiplayer was fine, got kicked out once for apparent connectivity issues. We do get kicked alot on split screen, tends to be more when inviting others too. Will let you know how it is today."
I'm gonna try solo multiplayer today and see how it works in comparison to split screen multi. But yeah let me know how it goes for you! I literally just wanna play this mf game why is it so hard lmao
"Same thing here,  been happening everytime I play split screen. It's annoying as fuck."
"+1 split screen multiplayer crashes on XBOX One. 

Really irritating because that�s basically all I really want to do, and it doesn�t work."
"It is happening to me, also. 

I�m on XBox."
Could it be a COD issue then? I was thinking it was a PS4 issue. I can't find much about it online like at all. Some people on reddit have posted abt it previously saying it was happening to them but w other games which is what made me think it was a Playstation issue but if you have an Xbox and it's also doing it then I suppose it might be COD. Is your error code the same??
"Same here on split screen only, and it was after the update a couple of weeks back. Let me know if anyone finds a fix, only thing we have found is its better when you play game after game, if you stay in the lobby too long and leave it a while whilst you have a drink, cig or anything the longer you leave it the worse it gets. Hope this helps. Cheers"
"So you've tried solo multiplayer and it was fine? Also, when my bf and I play split screen we always play game after game and a lot of the time it'll kick us mid-game or immediately after the first game. In fact, most of the time we get the error code RIGHT after player 2 joins. I tried having my bf (player 2) join on the main screen and the multiplayer screen but it doesn't seem to make a difference for us. The longest we've been able to play split screen multiplayer was 3 matches. :/"
Ever since the update multiplayer splitscreen crashed error ce-34878-0
Small update: I played solo multi and didn't have the error code pop up so I'm p sure it's just split screen multi where the issue is :(
It is as far as I'm aware. Been trying to play with my girlfriend and get the error code on split screen but I've been playing solo multiplayer and warzone most of the day with no issue
I have the exact same problem since last update of cod MW... Already backup the PS and reinstall everything all over again and nothing... Does any one found the solution? It's only when I'm in splitscreen.. help
"Our issue exactly! Got a PS4 pro for Christmas, worked great but since 2/1/21, same split screen multiplayer crash as soon as the level is about to load. That�s the only time, occasionally with a dev 5476 error like Nickk. Works fine on one player multiplayer but split screen so now we just switch off. At the same time, our players stopped leveling up at 55 and 47. Such a joke they can�t get it right and then there are dozens of (probably paid) bloggers saying it�s the PS4. Nope."
"Yeah definitely it's a bug only for split screen , even redownloading the game didn't help, so don't try that folks!  Hopefully they patch it in S2"
"Hi! 
Has anybody managed to figure out a way to fix this? Me and my boyfriend are also playing split screen. We have cleared the cache, game data and everything else we could find to do to fix the problem online & it�s still happening! Thanks! :)"
"Nope, still happening sadly. Reported it a few days to Activision but unless lots of people do I can�t see it getting any traction"
Please let Activison Support know! https://twitter.com/lukepj4/status/1365377987764514817?s=21
Going to message them now! I reset my entire PS4 because of this. So frustrating!
same here on split screen multiplayer and i�ve updated for s2 so they didn�t patch it
"Did anyone get anywhere with this, ours has gotten worse, tried everything they say on support and videos etc. Nothing has worked at all"
"Currently trying to install all the game add ons etc even for cold war to see if this rectifies the issue. Will keep you updated on whether it works and how.

Cheers"
did it work?
Did it work?
No :(
 It's crazy it keeps freezing at right the same spot for me. Did anyone had this fixed with the game working? This thread is doom and gloom. Gods of PS please help.
Late to this thread but anyone find anything? We still can't play:(
"No, it's still messed up :("
Yea I tried split screen online and had this issue. I saw a cause may be internet connection issue. I thought it was an issue w my external hdd but seems like just a common issue. I had same crash error with watch dogs online. I guess I�ll stick to solo online or avoid online games on my external hdd for a while.
"Same issue here. Going back to ww2.
On MW we can't even play 1 game in splitscreen.
Tried everything they say on YouTube videos and blogs. Hope they'll fix the game.

Thought it would be a problem with my ps4, but tried it on my brother's console. Same issue."
"I�m getting the same as everyone else. Tried moving to an external harddrive, reinstalling and every other option possible but still get the error.
Can play solo multiplayer but like everyone else, split screen is the problem"
Still happening. Nothing seems to work.
They're not going to give people a reason to keep playing MW. They know MW fans want STS24/7 and that's  exactly why they won't give it to them. They will do everything possible to coerce into buying the latest game.
"See the thing is, that works both ways. On the one hand, they might succeed in pushing people off MW. On the other hand, there are so many other timesink games one can play now that aren't COD, so not only are they pushing people away from MW, but those that already chose not to get CW won't buy it anyways and those that got chased off are being chased to different games (also Genshin exists for consoles)"
"I honestly just want a 4v4 playlist on the gunfight maps.

A nice change of pace compared to only shipment, rust and shoothouse."
This is the way
Has XP been fixed yet?
Yes it has
"Bro levelling up weapons is a PAIN on these other maps. I have to grind to get 20+ kills by desperately SEARCHING for people to kill on these bigass campy ass maps. And the problem is, those are all i get: Grazna Raid, Azhir Cave, Euphrates, etc. I have to sift through and back out until I find a medium sized map like Khandor Hideout, Hackney Yard, which are actually pretty good imo. But yeah i miss getting 50-60 kills on shipment and being able to fully level up weapons in just a couple matches."
What game mode are you playing? I've never played Euphrates.
"They've barely touched the multiplayer even during its life cycle and mainly before Warzone dropped, my bet is that they're returning to the old CoD system with one or two big balancing patches in the early months and then nothing. If you think about it, I've bought Cold War in early January and I still haven't seen a patch. I guess this is the cost of the new battlepass model, with supply drops they released one patch every month and most of the times ever more frequently."
"After them cocking this game (ik it�s fairly normal but this year was a special type, they actually broke the game instead of just dropping support) and the absolute dumpster fire that is Cold War I feel like I was fucked out of 120$ and this will probably be the last time I purchase a cod. I barely played from blops 2 until mw2019 and finally thought they had it again. Turns out the only thing they had was our money. 


Here�s to hoping battlefield 6 is a good game."
"It�s a known bug, no idea when it�ll be fixed though."
"Yeah, it's been like that for over a week now. No idea when it's going to be fixed though. They have had an update which fixed the no weapon xp but not the general xp"
"What? I thought it was fixed. At least it is for me.

 Damn, why the fuck they don't fix if for everyone?"
Delete the game and redownload it. Better than waiting around for activision to fix the damn bug.
I tried that. Didn't work for me.
Tried that and I didn�t work
"same happening with me. Booted it up for the first time since October and bam, level 0 and stuck on level 4 now. 
I was level 155 before, anyone know why it�s back to zero?"

"It's rather inspiring when you get called a hacker but you're doing poorly. 

On another note it's weird how some people think that they're fucking silent, so if you can hear them you must have walls or something."
Honestly
"It�s hardcore, takes 1 bullet to kill. How could anyone be called hacker. I would be annoyed w you but you had prime positioning"
"Idk, people get angry fast"
New lmg?
"Just the finn, trying to lvl it up"
Not a hacker. Just an other fucking camper. I really don't understand how people think this is hacking.
"But i'm not camping, im holding down an angle on the center lane?"
Anyone?
There farming xp
"kinda makes sense, but i�d assume you�d get more XP if you also went for some of the objectives. i usually end each operation with about 50 - 100 kills, and at least half of the objectives. and somehow still have more XP than most of my teammates"
"there is that famous mission ""Strongbox"" that is used to level up guns ever your block the side entrances with the cars and such"
Yeah co op can be painful. I'm convinced all the people on this sub who says it's too hard are the people who do that. If you stick together and do the objectives it's really not hard.
"agreed. on the other hand, nobody has a mic/mutes voice chat. so i�m out here playing the OBJ, and i alert them of a wave with 2 juggernauts, and they all die as soon as the jug sees them cuz they didn�t listed when i warned them"
Hey do you need help on vet crosswind? just completed it twice and all others pre lvl 30. if so hmu
"nope, i actually just completed it myself. appreciate the offer, and i�ll make sure to shoot you a DM if i ever need help"
Perhaps youd wanna duo and 3 star the other missions? ive yet to start those and was looking for someone to complete them with.
"yea, i�ve got a few left. shoot me a message, and we can plan for that."
What handgun

"i've had issues with this too. my operator challenges haven't been tracking, yet whenever i try to contact support, im placed as 199 in a 200 que and would have to wait 1 hour and 36 minutes.

I love shadow realm
Which AR is it?
"M4 or Kilo maybe bit faster ttk i think. They have pretty manageable recoils so you can use a few slots for faster ads speeds.  
I�ve been trying to speed up the Cr56 even though its got some spray"
"Honestly, Theres no Best AR Blueprint, some may have slight advantages over others like how some M4 blueprints have different iron sights compared to the base model. But all of it works the same.

I personally just soup up an AK and just start blasting not to compete, but just to have fun. In a way, the best games are when you enjoy your weapon's handling and performance no matter how heavy the recoil is. Even with non meta attachments, when you enjoy a gun's overall feel, you'll drop enemies most of the time."
"This is great advice to consider, thanks"
"Warzone or multiplayer? The VAL or CR-56 will probably be your best bet in multiplayer, not sure about warzone I don�t play it enough"
Multiplayer TDM is pretty much all I play
theres a grau bp with the best attachments named wolf mother
War pig xm4 hands down and it�s the best bundle in general has tracer rounds a sick Griggs skin a charm and two of the best guns in the game hands down
Isn�t the xm4 a black ops gun? Don�t see this bundle anywhere in MW
"There's a few.  Can you handle recoil, are you accurate, do you have a problem with using the meta or are you focuses on funness of a gun?  To me an ak 545 blueprint is really good bc it's a medium range weapon that does well in few different ranges but isn't one of the best."
"I do tend to struggle with recoil a bit, but feel I could adjust over time to handle it better. I've been looking at a few of the AK's. Might just try one without the blueprint for a while to see how it goes."
Do you realize how amazingly great a 7-12 actual kill average would be?
I�ll be honest the 12�s are pretty rare haha
wait...how is 7-12 great?
For MP I'd say anything below 30 isn't great lol. Unless you're on one life modes of course
I hope you are talking about a warzone 7 average. Cause in modern warfare 12 is still garbage.
"Wooow imagine paying money to ""improve your game"" shameeeee"
Lol after doing a bunch of research I�m sticking with my good ole M13
"It happend to me once, but that was because I kept putting the PS4 to sleep for days instead of shutting down completely. Eventually causing my HDD to crash and having to reformat it."
U dumb
You have the power of god and lag
I can't believe how bad it gets sometimes
Are you plugged in or WiFi? I have the same issue on my PC kind of annoying I�ll be playing with perfect latency and them some matches my shit spikes to like 180 plus
I'm playing off wifi. And isn't it odd? It's like this has been happening more often now.
"Best i can tell you is from a forum post, ""Simply go to http://www.activision.com and login, go to your profile, go to basic info, click edit username, then even though it says 0 changes left, or wait 6-12 months, you can still change the username and click save. It will ask you to put your password then boom, name is changed.""

some people have said if activision changes it you cant change it, also to keep trying on different browsers, phone etc."
"Yeah, I saw that and tried it, regrettably it didn't work and my name is still userxxxxxxxx."
"Have tried this so many times recently and it acts like it saves but it doesn�t.

Also...what the hell is offensive about ColdTips? Lmao."
The xp glitch has only been in the game a few days / weeks. You can�t have got that bad lmao
It�s mostly because of my sensitivity settings
Are you playing core or hardcore
Core
"You just need a few games to get back to normal. I played apex and warframe during that bug. The sensitivity and movement is veeeery different so it took me a few matches to get my barings back. 

On an other note if you are already doing terrible its a good timing to change you settings ;) a little bit more field of view or speed can't hurt!"
Sad ps4 noises
Wait I'm confused. Did you wallbang a kid?
Yeah lol the longshot thing pops up
the unlucky kar hit marker is karma for hitting that wall bang
Too bad it's aim assisted :/ otherwise I'd say good stuff.. Not sure why people post their kills when it's aim assisted lol
Please tell me you�re joking
stay salty bae

"You still got 200 more to collect within the next 20 tiers ,As for the purchase that sale thing has been bugged since MW."
I also have this bug. I figured the reason it doesn�t work is it must be just one more thing that�s BO only
Unfortunately I no longer have BO so I can't verify
It�s a visual bug
"If it was I probably wouldn't have noticed it because I would probably make those 15 kills in a single game, unless of course there is something missing in the translation (seriously, f\*ck region locks, my PS5 is in English and still COD isn't) like all those kills need to be in a single game or something"
Any of the operator missions havent worked in like two weeks for me. For example I have tried to complete minotaurs �get 15 kills with lmgs� and nothing happens when I get the kills. Its so frustrating cause I want the extra skins. At least I finally get new gun attachments
I have the same bug and spoke with the support 2 times and they did not help at all. :(
"Happened to me too a few months back, think it took them around 10 days after I submitted my support ticket for them to get back to me, it�s just kinda a matter of waiting. Best of luck man"
Crazy they havnt fixed this already
For real!
They shove cold war down our throats more than a hooker on a Saturday night. It needs to stop. I didn't pay $80 for an advertisement for Cold war I paid $80 for modern warfare and I fully intend to play modern warfare if I wanted to play Cold war I would fucking buy it. like what's the point of even having the battle pass in multiplayer when 99.9% of the shit in the battle pass can't even be used in multiplayer only warzone and Cold war
"That�s fax It�s like those people on YT who have to many adds in the video i can�t believe they�ve fucked over such a good game.

Also have you noticed that you are getting In really low lvl lobby�s in multi recently mine have been full of bot ass campers who sit at the back of the map or in corners"
The cod community has to be the worst gaming community ever
So true
Yes but I�m a way It�s the best
"I MIGHT buy CE when it�s like 20 bucks lol, so probably in a month or so, atm I�m having too much fun on BF1"
I�ve never tried bf and probably only will if I can find it on eBay for a fiver but I�m more of a cod person fair enough tho I�ll probably pick Cold War up for some cheapo second hand on eBay
Problem is too many people buy cod every year so nothing is going to change.
Yes but still for a big company focused around gaming and that fact that warzone is so big you would of thought they might put some effort into the games origin
Never attribute malice that can be adequately explained by incompetence
"Malicious incompetence, got it."
Mw is fucked rn
That�s fax
So it�s not just me that�s gone back to level 1? Still waiting for Activision to get back to me on it. Been a month...
Probably. It just you happens all the times games pretty much broke at this point
CW is is the best selling game above Mw.
"> Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War still made a ton of money, but not nearly as much as Modern Warfare. 

&#x200B;

>Modern Warfare revenue surpassed $600 million in just 3 days after launch. Today, SuperData revealed that Black Ops Cold War generated $678 million in about 6 weeks and that's with the Warzone integration.

[https://www.thegamer.com/black-ops-cold-war-sales-were-a-lot-slower-than-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/](https://www.thegamer.com/black-ops-cold-war-sales-were-a-lot-slower-than-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/)"
Stop acting like Cold War isn�t doing well it sold more than mw
"it made 678 million in about 6 weeks, MW2019 made that in 3 DAYS."
I never said it wasn�t doing well heck I was closed to buying it to get my guns up for warzone and the zombies all I�m saying is maybe they should maybe not ruin there original game so that we are forced to buy Cold War
But the Fennec has MUCH worse iron sight. That's what makes the Mac great.
well this complete bs but whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep at night bud
"TTK isn�t everything. The Mac10s mobility, lack of recoil, and larger clip make it a far superior choice to the Fennec."
So then why do people use the Mac 10 rather than the fennec?        Yes the fennec has had its own days.  Since the Mac came out it's legit the best way to go.      If you wanna be stubborn then use it in warzone and see where it gets you ;)
I have used the fennec against a mac 10 multiple times and have won the gun fight. its not being stubborn. I have multiple fennec builds and when im in a gunfight where fool is using a mac 10 i win.
"Wrong sub dude. The Mac10 is not a MW weapon. I wish people would use their heads before posting to this sub...  


You want:  
r/CODWarzone or r/blackopscoldwar"
"On paper. The mac10 has larger mag extensions,  faster handling, and even the max range fennec is redundant, because the mac10 has attachments that give it more range, if it is kitted for range, it is extremely close to the range of the fennec"
Which makes the mac more usable for not as skilled players. Ill have to try the fennec out thanks for bringing this to my attention.
"you will definitely need the right attachments for it. there are two builds that I recommend to anyone.

Build one: ZLR 18 inch barrel, merc grip, 40 round drum, no stock and sleight of hand

Build two: ZLR Sabre, ZLR 16 inch barrel, merc grip, 40 round drum, and sleight of hand

notice a pattern with the last attachment. ya soh is very much well not needed but recommended since the reload is very long."
"I really enjoy the Vector (Fennec/my gun-nut friends got me in the habit of using its RL name) Only drawback I see is lack of ammo, which makes Sleight of Hand a MUST."
"It's only available in survival mode at the moment you can buy it at the weapon station.

https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/l0hnbe/c9_melts_atleast_in_survival_early_gameplay_slaps/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
"Ok, thank you.  


One more Q, as a complete new guy to survival mode, where does one find the weapon station?"
"Activision is not fazed and simply wants money. They don't have even the tiniest droplet of concern for how people feel. They care about one thing, and one thing only, and that's profits."
"Ya, I totally agree with you. Why even mix MW with BOCW, I can see warzone, but not an entirely different game. It�s so stupid"
Well said
"Hacking + Cold War = Game deleted....

I wish everyone would boycott this fucking game. FUCK ACTIVISION!"
"I�d like to think boycotting is actually effective. I�m sure it was in the past, but people these days are so blind with their wallets. This is why we can�t have nice things."
"We are basically now paying a license to exist in the COD ecosystem, which they run as they see fit. We do not buy a single game that we just get to enjoy. 

It is a sad state of affairs in many ways."
"1. I never had to download any data packs when I redownloaded modern warfare's multiplayer after cold war came out so idk wtf you're talking about.
2. You guys were legit complaining about the rank system being so shit and now all of a sudden you guys are not a fan of the new goated prestige system?  
3. It legit says that the battle pass is only for ""WZ AND COLD WAR"" Warzone is a separate title, not MW so the person that buys the battle pass for cold war thinking they could use it in MW is at fault.
4. MW wasn't a great game, mediocre at best. Warzone saved MW and most of the community agrees with that. The only thing good about MW was some spec ops missions, warzone, and the campaign. The multiplayer was a disgrace to players that enjoy old-school cod if you asked for this bullshit tactical realistic gameplay then go play battlefield 6v6 or some shit. I started cod first with WAW and even though I loved it, MW3 was prob one of the best cod's to me. I'm sure infinity ward could make another good game like MW3 but activision is stopping IW from doing that."
I also had to download two data packs in order to play multiplayer last week after not playing in months
"It�s ok to have a different opinion, you know. There�s no need to harbor such hostility to people who think differently than you.

Thanks for sharing your opinion, but I, like many, disagree. Have fun with whatever games you play, my dude.

Edit:
Plus, I guess if you want to get technical, you�re putting me in a group that you only assumed I was part of. I�m an individual with my own opinions on the games I play. As are you. My main issue here, as I stated in the post, is the integration of BOCW into an entirely different game. It has no place, regardless of what you think about MW.

Plus, there�s simply no excuse for the tragic mishandling of MW since the release of BOCW. There�s no reason why XP should be nerfed and double XP simply not work anymore.

This damages the integrity of the game and that is what I care about. I don�t care about the medial politics that come with a fan base. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions about the games they play, so idgaf about it. What I care about is how much damage a company does to a game because they can�t handle the poor sales figures of their most recent product."
Warzone saved MW? HAHAHA
I think you�re falling victim to wishful thinking.  Activision is only going to get more fascistic as time progresses.
"I mean perhaps so but I don�t even mean it�ll continue getting content, I just mean it won�t get 100% ignored as it�s the foundation of warzone."
Is that the cure? Dual shock instead of dual sense?

Why are you playing on hotdog lol?
Sorry rod what was that?
I honestly miss modern warfare. Wish it could still get love from Activision.
Whoa CW looks like ass haha
He's playing on low settings I think...With shadows off.
Sorry but my hatred for Cold War extends to this post.
Cold War looks like a 360 game good lord.  How did they justify launching that?
"I turn all aim assist off, I find with auto I�ll be aiming at someone say mid range then someone will randomly run close to you all of a sudden your chasing a dude you wasn�t aiming at feels like intense stick drift"
"Yeah, aim assist works really well in MW, but the random auto-aim is the worst. I get that it's prolly just aim rotation, but when it tracks target for you at random, it feels like auto-aim. Although, after the update, it feels like it's randomly switching off. I'm not sure if I'm outside the aim assist range, but it feels inconsistent."
Feels the same to me. After update it feels like I can�t hit any shots. I switched from standard to focus and it helped a tiny bit but np much. Feels like something is off
Something is definitely up since the last update
"I don�t want to feed the salty part of my brain that just needs to get good instead of blaming the game, but I do utilize aim assist a lot for my play style (I like marksman rifles) and sometimes that shit seems to just vanish."
"Usually aim assist tends to lock on to the target a bit easier for consoles, but I'm legit missing my shots and almost wasting a full clip.

Meanwhile, the enemy infected team is throwing knives with 100% accuracy. WHAT THE FUCK"
I use Linear aim curve and Precision aim assist and yeah I have been noticing it feel weird a bit.
I play with it off
Aim assist should not exist in a cross platform game imo.
I agree with you when they took out FOV and MnK for PC.
This looks great until it flies into your hand at high speed when the weapon discharges.
Www.bladeofvalorkeyrings.not
I also cant play it without it crashing.
That sucks ass. What platform are you on? I play on PS4 and am currently only experiencing the XP bug and the Cold War advertising.
"I feel like a lot of people who are saying yes is because they only play warzone, I get XP in warzone but not in multiplayer matches. I don�t play warzone on the regular I play HC SND mostly so it�s been really annoying."
"Inconsistently, not every match."
I wonder why that is. I have a theory that when you see XP gains it's actually your challenge bonuses. Also I noticed that XP from the tournament doesn't count until after I finish a Multiplayer game. Have you accounted for these?
Honestly I haven't even looked. I just play for fun and don't care about the stats.
Yeah ive gotten XP. Played for about and hour today and yeah I got XP after every match
"I�m getting do on xbox as of a few days ago, but it was broken for a few days. I finally got my scar golden from level 11, and now I�ve got plat ARs.

It seems that the bug is fixed for some people, but not for others.

I know this is annoying, but try doing plunder supply run contracts to get XP. It gets 500 weapon xp for each completed, but it�s still annoying to do."
"Match XP, not weapon XP."
Back up that alternate reality bobby.
LOL against all evidence presented before you.
Fellow uzi user
I love the uzi sm
Fax
sounds like your cpu is struggling
Make sure that your processors aren�t overheating or throttling and that you aren�t running out of memory. This sounds more like a problem with your PC than it does a problem with the game.
"The game's optimization is still broken right now. I've been having huge performance drops after this and last update. I'm using a pretty beefy system (Ryzen 7 2700, RX 5600XT. M.2 SSD, and 16 GB's of RAM) so there's no way bad performance could be caused by it. I'd usually get 180 FPS average but now it's at 119 FPS average from my recent testing. My GPU overheats more now too, clocking in at 73�C average when it's always has been sitting around 55� C - 60� C and this is with my GPU fans at 100% speed. They really need to fix this now. This game alone is burning a goddamn hole in my PC."
Having the same issue.
"This was posted a lot of times, you need to buy a store Vault pack to access those missions. This pack will give you the first operator of the three and the possibility to unlock the remaining 2 via those challenges (just like when you unlock the operator via BP, it will give you the first one and you need to unlock the other skins playing).

The fact that the missions are showing is a bug.
If you want to check these vault operator packs, go to Codtracker and look at S1 bundles in the database."
May I ask what a store vault pack is?
"Made this as a send off to the boys before they shipped out to Cold War. But as it turns out, that game was butt cheeks so they came back we still terrorize the East Coast servers from time to time. 

Sorry if this is a bit too inside-jokey, still felt that some people would still enjoy it"
It had to stop you from using such god like power some how lmao
Hardcore Search and Destroy
Try winning in 4 seconds
Fucking genius
"After the last update, there has been a considerable amount of crashing for all platforms."
this has been happening for at least 4 months
HDR all the way my guy.

Grats I guess. But who/what were you playing against?  They were awful.
Idk who
"It seems to be an issue with the servers from what I can gather, because I've been having the same issue on my Xbox of getting very little or no exp after completing a match, even if I get high scores or challenges. It doesn't matter which game mode I play on, or whether I win or lose."
Let�s be honest the main reason to not have the note voting is to force people to play all maps. My guess is that they feel why make 20 maps of people play 4
"Well, just make better maps then? Or just make a compilation of the best maps of all older cods what would have been the problem? If they'd have made a compilaiton of Hardhat, Dome, Rust, Terminal, Seatown, Mission, and maybe highrise, without disabling it by making literally every inch of the map enterable like every vent, every door and stuff.. I guarantee you, almost everyone would play all these maps. If you did something like that, there'd be no reason for voting..

But even if you create 20 maps and only 4 are played, guess what? Voting could be tracked and you would get important feedback about your map design you otherwise wont get. You will see what your customers enjoy and what not. Feedback is insanely important to create even BETTER products than you already did."
I know Broadcast and Petrov Oil Rig come up an awful lot.
"Yeah though, Petrov Oil Rig is not THAT bad imo. You can still rush pretty well in it. The camping spots especially arent that easy to camp in imo."
"I play objective game modes, mainly hard point, then domination, and maybe sometimes headquarters and then I play some demolition if I�ve been put into that lobby, and also drop zone and onslaught when they are in the weekly playlists (like onslaught this week). HP spawns actually make sense and you can easily predict them if you play enough of the map. So here�s the maps I personally enjoy:

Shoot House (HP, HQ, DOM)

Shipment (HP, DOM)
(There was a shipment HQ mode but I think they removed it)

RUST (HP, DOM)
(Stay alway from onslaught and demolition on Rust, you will learn the true definition of being spawn trapped)

Khandor Hideout(DOM, HP)
(DOM plays better on this map than HP imo)

Gun Runner, Hackney Yard, St. Petrograd
(HP, DOM)
(Three of the better launch maps, in contradiction to Khandor Hideout, they play better on HP imo)

Cheshire Park, Scrap Yard, Hard Hat, Vacant, Talsik Backlot, Hovec Sawmill, Crash (HP, DOM)
(I always play HP on Cheshire park and Vacant if it is given to me)

Atlas Superstore, Broadcast, Petrov Oil Rig, Mialstor Tank Factory, Suldar Harbor (HP)
(HP on the Costco map is super underrated, but for the rest of the big maps I think only HP can save them from being never played on by me)

So basically that�s my final answer, hope you can get something out of this.

TL;DR Hardpoint is the game mode that can be super fun and save a somewhat okay map, especially a big map in this game. Domination as a game mode comes close in 2nd. 

P.S. Don�t know if you�ve noticed but I�ve never mentioned Piccadilly, Arklov Peak, Azhir Cave and Grazna Raid above............. yeah they are that shit, even HP can�t save them for me."
"Thanks man! :)

Yeah. I basically only played domination and kill confirmed so far. And rarely TDM and a single time, I played actually capture the flag.

But mate how tf do you have fun on Rust in domination? They completely ruined that map compared to MW2 imo. Im only like 80% sure since I played only like a few times on that MW2 map because I never owned the game only played when I was with a friend when we played splitscreen.

But I feel like there is far worse visbility and more hiding spots too, or at least they were made more safe.

Anytime I spawn on rust in this game in domination I just get shot at from 3 different angles. I tried to qs on the map like in mw2 with the friend I mentioned but holy shit. It worked like 2 games. After that I felt like I am just a walking grave."
"the maps are fine, its just the shit game modes. play HQ, and then 90% of the maps become good. just played a game on raid kill confirmed. my entire team camping laundry, their entire team camping apartments...zero reason to move. play HQ, then you're forced to move because you're not going to get any kills when the HQ is on the other side of the map"
"HQ = Headquarters right?

&#x200B;

Imma try it out never played it. I played all the gamemodes I knew only so far."
"hq is kinda ass, hardpoint is much better"
"Objective game modes cut through the bullshit of camping and bad map design, usually. I think TDM in this game is unplayable. There are too many places to hide and no incentive to move. I only play hardpoint for respawn modes and it is a BLAST. Everyone is sprinting to the hardpoint for the entire game. Anyone that is camping away from hardpoint isnt helping their team and when I die to them I don't care."
"Wow, I absolutely hate three of those maps and Suldal Harbor is the worst designed map in the entire game."
which maps do you like? I found Suldal Harbor quite capable of not being killed from a camper of 3500 different angles the first time you move. I often found a way to move rather safely. Hate not moving unlike in reallife.
That�s a broken controller with that jump shot...Lol
Elite controller series 2 :)
You guys didn�t believe [me ](https://youtu.be/TPySk3ZODa4)
"Can�t see it in loudout yet , but you can buy it in survival on the weapon box :-)"
"It�s not released yet so you won�t have it, but once it is released hopefully you won�t have to do the challenge to unlock it"
"not every pc player is that good


source: I�m not that good"
"Watch Handler's old videos before he switched to PC. Controller console players can compete. It's for sure easier on PC with higher FOV and more fps though.

And if we're being honest here this guy looks like hes on super fast sens on controller. The end where he spins right 360 then kills is something I only see controller players do."
"HELL YEAH, Handler's the fucking man!

He's insane on both, but he is definitely better on controller."
That pc player actually missed a bunch of shots. The high sens actually hurt him.
You kidding right? I�m in nothing but sweaty lobbies and most are consoles (I�m pc) - I rarely see console players miss shots
You think it�s easy to play on pc like that guy does? His mouse sensitivity looks hella high and any regular person would miss every shot if they played like that. There are just as many sweaty console players like him aswell
"I don�t think anybody�s saying it�s easy, but it does seem pretty unfair as far as most things go. If someone played on PC with crossplay off and had a 1.2 KD I suspect they�d wipe the floor with console players with a 1.2 KD once crossplay was turned on"
"yeah but having a smooth movement on pad is extremely hard, I have a 12/12 sensivity a�d I still can't move fast while aiming or moving"
[deleted]
that�s suspiciously accurate and fast...
Look up Exoghost.
More like fast and inaccurate lol
he�s not aimbotting
"no its pretty common for sweaty PC player. he overcompensated his aim way too much and miss this first few shots and adjusted then after. 

theres no way aimassist can compete with mouse & keyboard"
"Skill ceiling is higher. Aim assist is stronk and evens the playing field quite a lot (people used controller on PC in Titanfall 1 sometimes because of this), and these cases as in the OP feel pretty much just as bad for the common M+KB player."
"I play like that and I use a controller, High sense and map awareness is the key."
"this guy has unusually high sens on the mouse. guaranteed he got pretty damn lucky with those shots.

&#x200B;

90% of PC players aren't even close to this."
You can move like that on console with max sensitivity dynamic aim response low dead zone and a good controller
Get a better gaming chair
"Obviously he�s got a better weapon than my ridiculous LMG and he�s fortunate enough to slide under my bullets, but still that TTK is insane. Won 200-0 to be fair, but coming up against decent PC players in consecutive games really is a session killer."
"The ttk isn't insane, it's the same as it is on console, if anything that's the most consistent part of this entire video."
I mean.... i don't wanna be rude but you just gotta hit your shots man..
I agree. I cannot move like that with a controller. It's truly not fair.
So there aren't any console players on adderall? A bit of strafing and he will overcorrect like 100 percent with that dpi.
I use mouse keyboard on Xbox but since update my mouse doesn�t work with MW but it works perfectly fine with black ops Cold War. Like what?
"i play on 6 something sensitivity.. and it's a real pain in the ass for a quick turn.. or maybe i'm still not used to it.. i came from high sensitivity not so long ago

higher sensitivity players don't hit their shots usually.. they're pretty easy to kill

i guess he got lucky

pc players like shroud and i found other researches on the internet that both controller and mouse both has their own advantage and disadvantages..

so no winner.. they're balanced.. but they don't go play tournaments maybe"
That�s cap
That snap was weird
"Console players do miss shots,And this feels like a passive target snapping from an aimbot. Aka like the Super aim-assist"
You only need the base game weapons to get platinum so you don't need to do the Crossbow or Rytec
"Seriously? So you�re telling me that I only have two weapons left before getting platinum? Dang bro you just got me fired up to grind them to the maximum and unlock gold. 

Thanks a lot bro!"
You don�t need the Rytec or the Crossbow lol
Yup I just found that out just now :) But thanks anyway bro!
Hardcore is yr friend esp when it comes to the dragunov.
Yeah I think I�ll give it a try soon. Thanks mate!
"Ground War, easiest there."
For the longshots right?
"Hey guys for the marksman rifles, I got gold for the ebr, the mk2 carbine, and the kar98 but still don't have platinum. What gives?"
"Have you unlocked gold camos for your sniper rifles as well? The conditions of getting platinum on your marksman rifle is that you have to unlock gold on your snipers as well. The snipers that you must get gold are Dragunov, HDR and AX50."
"My experience so far:  Reached out to @ATVIAssist on Twitter.  They took my info, reviewed it, and granted me a refund of the 300 points I was owed.  I logged back in later to find they had refunded me just 3 points (gee, I wonder why the sale was broken in the first place /s).  Now, the next rep responded that they don't refund in-game purchases totally missing the point.  I'll probably eventually get it back when this person removes their head from their rear or I get the next rep.

Update:  So, I didn't mention it before, but they offered no other recompense or accommodation for the lost opportunity to purchase more tiers on sale.  Still no further response on Twitter after two unsuccessful attempts to connect to the support chat (over 100 in queue and over an hour wait...got disconnected and then chat was too busy).  Finally, today, I received an option I would have otherwise tried from the start and was able to open a ticket.  Fingers crossed they get to it before the pass ends."
Just happened to me too. Don�t have enough for next pass now. :(
Yea it�s BS. I�m gonna contact support at 4. Hopefully they fix the issue or give me the points to make it where it�s on sale.
"I can't believe they closed the tournament after only three days. Seems rather quick compared to past tournaments. The Famas ""The Fallen"" blueprint instantly becomes the rarest blueprint in the game if you won the tournament just for sheer time allowed to grab it."
"This is very true, i just said this to my friend who I won with (I did win it with another friend yesterday as well).

They should have a timer on it, so that we will know."
"I meant to write finale, my bad."
Good thing XP is tracking right now.....
Ez way to level up
All you need to level up is to be brutally pummeled by Death himself!
"I'm sorry, what's happening here? Are the bullets bouncing back to the Harrier?"
"Nah, the bullets are just being deflected, but honestly, it looks like the shield should explode."
uninstall and reinstall the game. i had the same issue.
"It might just be to do with your WiFi strength, I have crappy WiFi and I have the same problem as you"
I tried with mobile network it didn't work too
"I experienced this over the last couple of days as well. It may be related to the latest update.

Edit: Added more details. 

I speed tested my WiFi on the same network from multiple devices, and they all worked fine (i.e. reported within their usual range) . This issue mainly occurred on my PS4 and on a wired connection. Couldn't play for hours, so I switched to wireless mode on PS4 and it (mostly) worked fine,  but I believe that was coincidental since it was still inconsistent (and usually my wired connection is more secure and faster). 

I also have a 1GB internet connection in my home and disabled most other devices while testing this, so I'm used to seeing anywhere from 200 mbps - 500 mbps reflected in the native ps4 connection tests. In the ""fetching profile"" case,  I saw lower hundreds of kbps. WAY slower despite other devices on the network operating at high download speeds.

It's very possible my ethernet port on the ps4 is messed up (I tested that ethernet cable separately), but I doubt that too. Especially since it worked fine today after a few tries, but was smooth sailing after the connection was made and matches showed no lag and 30-40 ping. I disconnected and reconnected a few times after that as well, and still experienced the fetching profile issue once or twice. 

TL;DR: After some fairly thorough troubleshooting, I really think these issues are related to bugs in the latest software update and would suggest waiting for a fix (which may or may not happen soon)."
"Thanks for responding
I've been through this about 3 days now
I always use wireless connection
But I'll try wired connection too
Also I have seen my friends with the same internet even slower
But they connect easily 
I'm so mad now
First xp bug and now this 
Hope it fix soon"
You have to be kidding me
just why
also pretty sure activision don�t make modern warfare
"Depends on how you look at it.

On the surface, they're just the publisher. But when you dig deeper, they actually own various stables of devs that make all Call of Duty games.

So no, they don't physically make the games, but they are 100% in charge of their direction and especially monetization."
I�ve got a million dollars in Elon Musks bank account do you think Bank of America will send it to me if I can verify his dog name
Do them all. They each have redeeming qualities. I thought the Fal would be impossible for me being a semi and I was not a fan. The more i used it the more I appreciated it and my aim became better when I completed it. It is still a gun i use regularly.
I�m going to do them all. I just want to see what y�all recommend I start with
The SCAR looks dope gold
Do the famas first it�s the hardest
"I�ve done almost all base game ARs(only scar left), and I have to say, FAL is amazing, FR 5.56 is awful IMO(I hate burst weapons), oden is pretty fun to tap fire, and scar(what I�m currently doing) is pretty awful.

Scar is like a lower damage full auto FAL. It�s really only good in HC since it�s a 1 shot, and in core you get outgunned by basically any weapon."
I switched the fr to single shot instead of burst and it made it a lot easier for me and more comparable to the fal
"What? SCAR is great, really accurate and good at range, just like 7.62 AK"
"I�ve got my AR platinum and out of all these the SCAR was the first and by far the easiest to get gold for in hardcore. The FAL is probably the hardest since it�s a semi-auto and that makes long shot a bit tricky compared to the rest in hardcore where a sustained fire could compensate for your inaccuracies, but if you are grinding camos in core, the FAL probably would be the easiest if you can reach its maximum fire rate since the ttk will be way faster. And if you are stuck on longshot camos and haven�t tried hardcore yet, you are definitely making it unnecessarily hard for yourself since all these weapon 1 shot at ANY range in hardcore."
Thats a silly question
"Feels like it, but depending on where you go, you'll find some die-hard SBMM fans. I've run into some who swear by SBMM."
"Good SBMM is nice. MW SBMM is trash. Most of my games i either get oblitarated or I slap. Very rarelly will I see a tight game where people are skilled about the same. Which is sad because that is the goal of SBMM. And those games are fun. When it plays on the last kills you know the team at least were balanced.

That said connection match making is sweet. If I can stop seeing people teleporting on my screen cause of their McDonald wifi quality internet itd be great."
"We're talking about CoD, let's try and keep it within the realm of possibility. In all seriousness, though, I'm sure a good SBMM system would work well, along with a CBMM system, but in order for them to work together, SBMM would have to be a little more lax."
"Why we can't have both? Ofc playing with ping over 150 unpleasant, but also being stomped by habitants of man-caves"
Look. Don't get me wrong that would be fantastic. But right now JUST SBMM dosen't even work. In my experience if I win a game there is two options. Either i end up in a god lobby and get shit on or I end up with a bunch of noobs on my team that i'm supposed to carry. Lose a game? I'll be in a noob lobby or I will look like the noob while getting carried. I do have a 1.*something* win loss which kind of makes sense but most games aren't any kind of fun. So adding connection match making to this broken algorythm? Man it would be all over the place!
I feel like having 2 matchmaking systems would make it really hard to find lobbies.
"I think SBMM overall is good, however I don't think it should take precedence over connection.  

SBMM works best in games with casual and ranked modes, where one is guaranteed to be a sweatfest and the other is a 50/50 between fucking about or people sweating. COD would have difficulty with this because of the number of gamemodes it has. But I don't think SBMM is as bad a thing as most people make out, but I think it may have been implemented badly."
connection based as I'm sure everyone will say. sbmm will either make you lag or you'll play with the same people over and over bc of the strict skill gap they currently have
"The problem is we don't know how SBMM even works. Same with Cold War. Couple YT�rs have done testing, but that doesn't mean anything. There are shady patents out there that we'll never know whether are implemented or not, and Activision doesn't even acknowledge SBMM. 

All I know is at times I feel like I'm not playing the same game as my opponents, or even my own teammates at time. Other times I feel nerfed, or even feel the other team has been nerfed. It's very inconsistent."
"Sbmm for league/ranked, connection for general lobbies"
"agreed. MW doesn't have ranked, though, does it? If not, missed opportunity."
"SBMM is broken bc of the algorithm that puts people who spend more money on the game into easier lobbies so ""noobs"" will see the skins and want them too."
"I don't know if that's true or not, but it doesn't seem unlikely to happen."
"I just went with SBMM due not having much issue with it and connections are fine but ideally we should have matchmaking options to choose.

Something like a search filter for skill, connection and a mixed or balanced option."
"SBMM makes every match, at every skill level, into a sweatfest. It punishes players for doing well. One good match means you're going to get mulched in the next one- pulling you closer to a 1.0 K/D. SBMM means you have to decide if you going to play casually forever, or competitive forever, and you are not allowed to switch without 10-15 matches of recalibration.  


SBMM is the reason K/D is irrelevant in MW and CW, since an unseen force is manipulating your matchmaking to get you closer to a 1.0 K/D."
"Unironically prefer sbmm. Modes like 10v10 and GW have very little, and it leads to games often playing the same and stomping lobbies. 6v6 has more variety thanks to SBMM."
"I'm glad GW doesn't have it. The skill bracket I'm in is very sweaty (I don't know how I got to that skill bracket, I am just a filthy casual) and all the sweats in GW treat their K/D better than they treat their family, so they camp with a sniper the entire match, and then little noobs run around in the open with shotguns. I'm not really one to talk about GW, though, because I'm one of the people who hates it. I can't say much about 10v10, I played that a little when I was but a noob, and haven't touched it since, but 6v6 I find to be completely lacking in variety since I'm just playing carbon copies of myself every match. While I like some SBMM, I don't like super strict SBMM. I want variety and not just a bunch of tryhards using shields and shotguns, the Amax and the Kar every game."
"You don�t really need a load out for long shots with an SMG, but if you want a class for it go for a medium/chunky scope, monolithic suppressor, and just any attachments that control recoil. It�s pretty easy to get long shots with an SMG."
Bro I tried the recoil was absolute trash
"Easiest way to get long shots is on shoothouse. Jump up on the ledge in front of where you spawn and wait for enemies to appear at the other side. I would say play it on hardcore too, makes it a lot easier. And attachment wise, monolithic integral, rubberized tape, ranger grip, whatever sight you want and a straight line stock if you need it. Slow ass ADS but probably the best recoil control you can get, good luck"
"play hardcore, it is a 2 shot kill at every range. use a 3x scope and the monolithic barrel, that should be enough to get longshots in hardcore"
This is some looney toon wiley coyote type shit
"No, they not, it just visual bug"
This probably means they�re bringing the sykov into multiplayer then
"Yeah, Happy to know the rumor is true! I got Modern Warfare around a month before Cold War came out, it's great to know they will still release content."
"What the fuck is this challenge honestly?

1. Grind to unlock Renetti
2. Grind to unlock Sykov
3. Grind to unlock perk for Sykov
4. Grind to get kills with perk on Sykov

Really?"
"its just a bug, you dont need to use the sykov"
Its just a bug
This has been posted like 10 times. Its just a text bug. Use the Renetti with Mo Money and it unlocks
"Oh, whoops! I didn't realize! Thanks for telling me!"
Are you using boost high? If you are that's why.
None of those options seem to change anything actually.
How tf did you survive getting stuck?
Holy cow
"I use air strike and cluster when I�m trying to be quick and on the run, I use predator when I for sure need a kill, either in search or if I�m trying to get all my kill streaks"
cruise missile can also take out killstreaks. Always funny holding one for a vtol and immediately taking it out.
I always save my cruise missile for ac130s in ground war. Sooo satisfying taking them out
cruise is so slow to deploy and doesnt have as big area of effect as the air strike
The only benefit I see to the air strike is that you don�t pilot it
"Fuck yeah bro, put the scope, tac laser, short stock, bigass barrel on that shit and make a makeshift sniper."
"I was running the scope but been trying to get better at the iron sights. Loving it though, definitely takes some time to get used to it."
The skins were exclusive to the Season 5 BP so there is no way you can get them.
"Pardon my naivete, but I�m 99% sure I just unlocked those skins this week by completing the Operator missions�which shockingly weren�t bugged for the base Allegiance Mil-Sim.

You�re talking about the the black operator with goggles on his helmet and the same with goggles worn normally?"
I'm talking about this operator: [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mv7dShSuCqM/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mv7dShSuCqM/maxresdefault.jpg)
"You slept on that one for a while. This bug has been there for about 2 weeks. There was an update a few days ago that was supoosed to fix it. Aparently it did...for some player but not all of them. Will it be fixed? I mean the devs made the ""effort"" to try to patch it after a week or so. My gess is that they will try again."
I don't get any xp either. Shit is getting old.
Did the new update take away the Gunsmith ? Can�t seem to edit my LoadOuts anymore
"Mono suppressor, merc fore grip, 60 rd mag, close quarters stock and tac laser.

I use the same in warzone accept I change it to no stock and take off the laser for sleight of hand!"
"Thank you, how is the Recoil control on this? Its good?"
"I pretty much do the opposite. The MP7 with no stock is great for MP as its close quarters, in Warzone you need more range and less recoil so i usually avoid it. As for the Tac Laser, its good in both for the added ADS but comes into its own with range as it helps the stability, so therefore is perfect for Warzone."
"Mono suppressor, 50 round mags or sleight of hand, tac laser, recon barrel and stippled grip. Keep the normal stock"
"I will try that too, thank you."
"you can go with the full hipfire build 60 rnd mag, merc foregrip, 5mw laser, no stock and stippled grip"
"A bit late to this but I hope my setup can help you find a general direction:
Monolithic suppressor, stippled grip, Merc/Ranger foregrip, FSS close quarter stock and for the last attachment you can choose between a range extending barrel or an extended mag (or swap the stock out to have both a long barrel and an extended mag). Hope this helps and good luck.

Edit: Just noticed that you are also asking for AR attachments, particularly lightweight AR�s. My philosophy in building these guns, such as the M13, Ram, M4, Kilo and Grau, is to �beat them to the gun�, or kit them for mobility in a more general term, particularly stacking 5mW with stippled grip tape for fastest sprint to fire. I usually take a Commando foregrip next bc it doesn�t slow down my ADS and it reduces side to side recoil bounce. The last two attachments is up to you, I usually take an optic and a muzzle device (brake/comp). Extended mag is a good choice too and you could also consider the stock that reduce your ADS speed or increase your ADS movement speed. Good luck again."
"I know you already got a couple replies, but I thought I'd share my setup. I run muzzle brake, commando foregrip, 50 rd mag, stippled grip tape, and sleight of hand. It shreds at close range and isn't bad at medium either. I got a 45m longshot with it earlier today lol"

Is it fixed now then
Not fixed for me on PS4
Nah ive got a total of 1 level in the past week and that was by playing Warzone
A whole nother week with no xp.. amazing.
It isn�t fixed as far as I know.  Not as of this morning.  Nothing on Raven Software�s Twitter either.  You still can�t earn XP at least on the PS4
Im on PC and it works good as new
"Updates roll out PC, then Xbox, then PS4 so i belive you'll be getting it next week"
The whole video can be found at youtube.com/ToadENT
Mp5
I feel her pain
Haha yeah happens to everyone at some point
When we play my wife still commits suicide on accident all the time. This video resonates.
Haha yep but we always have fun
Join the club. Motherfuckers ruining the game. Fuck cold war.
That makes so much sense.  I've been level 30ish in the battle pass (not that I care now) for the past 2 weeks and I couldnt figure out why
Yeah the only reason i've been thinking of getting it is for the zombies. So far in the past 2 weeks i've gone up one level by playing a match of warzone
"XP is broken. Ever since the update a couple Thursdays back people have been having issues. Can still unlock weapon camos but no character or weapon XP. Only way round it I�ve found is doing spec-ops but that only really works if you�re looking to upgrade weapons. I got an email from Activision saying the studio �are aware of the issue, with no time on a fix available at this time� or something so for now you�re fucked basically, ruined the game for me though, just trying to push everyone on to Cold War."
So yeah basically they've disabled xp to get people to play cold war because the cold war multiplayer is shit? Wouldn't put it past the people who allowed the loot boxes in Infinite Warfare to do that
So you didn't read any of the past post this past week.. you just posting for attention
"Ssshhhhh, its ok... we know you are here... ssshhhhh"
"For the new zombies they�re adding, the beeping is morse code"
Happened to my buddie yesterday no idea what it is
Next season pass hits
"Yah I�ve heard couple things - heard for new battle pass, and zombies. Also heard it has something to do w anniversary of WZ (March) for a new map or something. Hell could just be another broken aspect of the game ha"
Good ol cod timing. Hits me every day
They even tried the fake out look away
"What are you reporting them for exactly? While I don't do it myself, camping has been in every CoD, and is, unfortunately, a play style.

Just curious, what category are you reporting them for? lol"
"I report them for Exploiting. I didn't know it's a play style, I thought no one likes campers except campers themselves. As I said I only played cod4 from 2007 previously and I still like that game a lot but the problem is there is only a few servers left that I like and it is rarely someone playing on them."
You�re reporting people for... camping?
"Yeah. I know it's stupid but what else am I supposed to do, except to stop playing?"
This is one of the reasons they don�t take reports serious
"They arnt cheating, reporting campers is just being a whiner."
"I totally understand the frustration, but there are no rules that says you can't camp. Just as there are no rules requiring you to move or else have your weapons disappear. 

Furthermore, I don't think you understand what ""exploiting"" the game means. Exploiting is using a programming glitch to give yourself an unfair advantage (e.g. - clipping into buildings, getting outside or under the map). Simply using the game assets within the intended normal use, is not ""exploiting"" the game or cheating by any means. Holding a power position by camping can control flow of movement on the map and potentially give your team a tactical advantage, and can be a legitimate means of playing the game. 

Is camping annoying, hell yes. But it's not cheating or exploiting by any means. 

You need to change how you approach the problem. Players who truly camp give their position away. Watch the kill cam - you'll see their perspective and you know where they are. With the knowledge of where they are you can avoid their line of fire, and if you are seeking revenge you can find a way to get behind them and take them out."
Infinity ward made maps in a way so people could camp...... they ain�t banning no one. They don�t even ban hackers
"Well, that's a shame. I guess I will make a class with VAL and SPR then to try to piss tjem off."
"1. You can�t mark people in none warzone modes.

2. It�s there on the store section marked with a green indicator you just need to find it."
No bro i also have a free bundle but it doesn�t exist
"So marking/pinging is Battle Royale only?

I've checked every single item, and nothing is marked free."
Where https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/fYe4m9qz40aC
You'll need a team of 4 to play co-op with you in pubs. Good luck getting past wave 13-14 with the suicide bombers
In survival with 4 players. BUT right now the XP is broken so don�t bother leveling up now. And the RAAL LMG unlock challenge is broken too
What's the RAAL lmg?
"You can barely find it because when other people find it, they never leave the matches"
"Honestly I play every map like once a day in free for all, I didn�t realize how many maps this game has now."
Shoot the ship used to be LTM twice a season... beginning and end. Very rarely does it pop up for me otherwise... it�s where I love to grind my new guns or gold them usually... I wonder why the devs have limited the playlist further...
"I get shipment multiple times whenever I play. This is usually on kill confirmed. I get shoot house maybe once every time, usually more on search and destroy but it�s search lol."
"They used to, but it made the MP5 too OP, to the point it was out gunning ARs at range."
now the val has taken its place pretty much.
[deleted]
is there an actual point to running 10mm? I don't exactly trust the games stats
"Unless you have a free attachment slot & are going for a speed built but even then I�d rather have SoH or fmj. 

The game stats are ass that�s why you have to go check out people who actually test them"
"there is if you plan on challenging people at distances beyond 20-30m and don't worry about the ammo (i mean overall count, not the individual mag)"
I don't remember exactly when it was nerfed but at one point 10mm was an absolute must have. Mp5 with 10mm would drop people fast. I tried it recently again but it's just not worth having when you can have better attachments
Makes me sad that I never tried 10mm before the nerf. I always forget ammo conversions exist. Didn't even try the AK 5.45 until recently and they absolutely slap.
Yeah I get less kills with 10mm with that stupid recoil and not enough bullets
There's no barrels that increase damage range on the MP5 so the 10mm Auto rounds serve as your range increasing attachment.
"Yup, that�s why I use them"
"I read your response wrong the first time, I didn�t notice you were specifically taking about barrel attachments. 

The mono intergal suppressor increases DR by 12% & velocity 25%"
"Yes the 10 increase damage range my guy, this isn�t some secret. Base mp5 is 9.5m before the first damage drop off vs the 10mm rounds start at 10.5m. 

Second drop off is at 9.5-17.5 vs. 10.5-21.5m

Third 17.5-25.8 vs 21.5-41m  

Etc etc"
I always use the 10mm rounds
Is there a reason or just preference ?
Happening to me and hella other people. I haven't heard anything yet as a fix myself.
"At the very least, I'm glad that it isn't an isolated problem. I was worrying about my system breaking."
"Same issue, I thought it was only me since my friends weren�t experiencing it"
"I have it happen, and it seems to be because of the reticle I use. Using the 2nd to last holo optic, I get 3 of the flashlight thing at the end of my barrel."
That�s not search and destroy.
"I swear to god that yellow tarp on Petrograd gets me every time! At least once a game I try and jump on it, as it it might have somehow changed from my last 100 attempts lol"
Stopping by to deliver a dislike to yet another lame rifle clip
He�s not wrong. These types of clips are so outdated ngl
Mad?
"I wouldn't remove anything. Removing features is terrible, balancing them is the solution."
How are you going to put up a poll like this and not include the SP-R?
spr is kinda cheese but I never see anybody use it
"Do people still hate the 725? I can't remember the last time I saw one

Tbh the As Val is a little OP but it's not too bad imo. It's a 2/3 shot kill sure, but it's not as accurate as stuff like the M4 and Ram so it doesn't bother me too much."
"I see 725's every other match. and as val is broken, I've never been able to outgun it unless I was flanking them. when ever I use the val in search i usually get 20+ kills, any other weapon, i get shit on"
Dime a dozen.
The ONLY solution
Wait what?
"You only get placed in in-progress games in the first game after hitting queue. So it you stick with that game, every game after is guaranteed to be a new game. And as a solo queue it's easier to get you to fill the odd missing person in a lobby. But like I say if you stick with game 1 you'll always get new lobbies.  

As for team balance I do think it tries to put good players with worse players, but I'm not entirely sure. This is how team balance worked in older CODs at least. If I'm being honest I don't take W/L too seriously on TDM and Domination, because those modes you can't carry as one guy. No matter how well you do, having 1 or 2 bot-tier teammates can ensure a loss. 

I only care about W/L on FFA, hardpoint and HQ. On those modes it is actually possible to solo carry because of how the modes work. For TDM I just play to do well myself and ignore if we actually win or not. If I go positive and get 25+ kills then it's a win in my books, regardless of whether it's ACTUALLY a win haha"
"No, it doesn't actively try to match good with bad *while putting the lobby together*, but will gladly do so when assigning teams

So if you're insanely good, you get the 5 worst players rather consistently"
Nope u are solo queueing so they try to put u in games where they really only need the one person. Usually it�s games where u are losing since people rage quit
Forget about Cold War. I have both of them and MW is superior in every single way
but theres also the massive amount of storage it takes up tho im just sorta wary about that
"I have both and I prefer playing MW, THE only reason I play Cold War is for zombies while Multiplayer in MW is better than CW"
Even in zombies it has a lot of bugs that need to be fixed
yeah i played the free week for zombies and the multiplayer alpha and I really enjoy the zombies but I didnt play the multiplayer enough
"Yeah it�s definitely still worth it. Still has a big player base and everything so no need to worry about that. Storage could be an issue but just google how much it takes up on whatever ur using to play (idk if it�s the same) and see if u have enough space


Not played Cold War so can�t rlly say anything about that"
Modern warfare over Cold War any day. Definitely still worth it
I really didn't realise until I posted this how many people prefer me to cold War.
I bought it in December and it was definitely worth it!
"Definitely no, the game is great but it has it's final content drop on march, after that it will fall into obscurity like all other CoDs, better save for CW, you have a year of content support with it."
"Save for mw2.  Nothing will redeem CW at this point.  The core gameplay and maps are locked.  I wish MW was handled by ubisoft who STILL supports rainbow 6 seige.  And yes, Ubi is usually very buggy with release, but man do they support a lot of their games longer than 1 year"
"I have played both modern warfare and cold war and I like the modern warfare multiplayer better. I feel like cold wars multiplayer is cartoony and clunky compared to modern warfare. But in cold war, zombies is really fun. So if you like playing zombies more than multiplayer I would choose cold war and vice versa"
I played both the 2v2 alpha for mw and the multilayer alpha for cold War and I didn't play much of either but during the zombies free week on cold War I played the hell out of it but I did really enjoy the mw alpha and I want to play pvp so I think I will get mw. Thanks for helping me decide!
Buy Modern Warfare Even If You Dont Like The Multiplayer The Campaign Itself Is Worth a Play through
"But it's quite short. Also someone's helped me come to the conclusion and I'm getting mw now, thanks for your opinion anyway though."
"YES

I got my friend- who normally just plays single player games like red dead, gta, assassins creed he has never played a cod game- to try out modern warfare around a year ago and we�re still banging this game out all day, grinding for camos and competing in competitive game modes. Let me tell you why this game is fantastic, and more than just your typical call of duty game

1. The campaign is pretty cool, you get some great moments like Piccadilly, clean house and the siege at the end. This is all brought to you with a real, gritty and realistic way that hasn�t been seen in mainstream FPS games for years.

2. Custom games. I don�t know if this is just something for me, but even when it does get boring grinding and playing on multiplayer online, custom games is the offline alternative that lets you mess around to make crazy and bizarre scenarios and modes, like knives only, zombies, mini battle royale, or even mil-sim tactical realism. It�s amazing and I�m still experimenting with custom game modes to this day!

3. THE MULTIPLAYER
There is a ridiculous amount of things you can do it in multiplayer, for example- 
- Grinding your guns for gold, silver, Damascus or obsidian camos
- Playing competitive game modes like search and destroy, gunfight tournaments and cyber attack
-messing around with friends
-playing casually
Basically, the list goes on.

In conclusion, modern warfare is definitely the most worthwhile game I�ve bought since Halo 3 so many years ago. It�s amazing, I�ll still be playing it for years to come due to its offline capabilities, and me and my friend both can agree that Cold War was disappointing and a big step backwards for call of duty. It was not worth the purchase, even though I got it for sale for �33 i still thought it was a rip off compared to this game."
"Jesus christ, I was already persuaded by another comment to get mw but THIS FUCKING COMMENT that is practically a better examination than IGN did has definitely convinced me to get this game. Whilst I really dont think it can be as amazing as halo 2 managed to be, I still think it will be very worthwhile. thank you kind person!"
"If your friend likes singleplayer games so much I hope for the love of Talos that he played ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"""
"Only if they fix the XP bug. Right now, you can only level up from challenges and get no XP for playing matches."
Is there daily challenges?
"I love it but hate it because I suck so bad at it. I'm not sure if there is something I'm missing but I've tried everything. Every groundwar game i play I get killed over and over again. I try to snipe, i get sniped before i can see anything. If i take an objective, i get shot before i see anyone. The red tag doesnt appear until I'm dead. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to shoot someone in the face and they dont die but you do. Every. Single. Time. Unless its a small map like shipment, I can't kill anyone. I have finally decided after a year and a half that it will never get any better no matter what i do. I will no longer play this game even though I like it so much. Its just not for me. I have wasted an insane amount of time on a game that no matter what i do or hours i put in, i will never be able to flick my crosshairs over and hit an object the size of a gnat in .0000001 seconds like literally every player in this game. The only people left playing this are the ones who are ridiculously good sweaty tryhard gamers. Theres no casual players left to play against."
"When I was playing WarZone everything was fine but after I bought MW I got this error after running the game :(  
dev error 6034 ww\_code\_pre\_gfx.ff"
Are you on ps4?
"both Cold War and MW are shit show games, but if I had to choose a piece of shit it will be MW."
I haven't played a cod game since bo2 and I just wanna try one again tbh. Also happy cake day!
"I spent �27 on it in December 2019 and I still regret, the game is slow, camper friendly, flawed with broken weapons and spawns and it has terrible maps full of dark spots and headglitches. The maps are so bad that even hardcore fans seem to refuse to play anything outside Shipment/Shoothouse. If anything download Warzone, it's better and cheaper (as it is free)."
Seems like its just you mate

No way.  A completely reasonable response to this is anything between frisbeeing your CD out the window and sledghammering your computer/console.

That was cold
Yeah no xp for me either. Tho sometimes I get like 400 xp for 30 kills
Lucky I get 0 xp for 30 kills
On PS4 - no XP at all.  It seems like my weapons are leveling up but since I just bought the game last week not knowing about this and have been stuck at level 1 all this time I can�t really check
It's broke. Sometimes you get xp other times you don't. No hit markers either. And is it just me or is the game environment having a hard time rendering(more than usual) and having to render multiple times.
I thought it was my connection(even though nothing changed).
Zooming into buildings from far away takes like 3-5 seconds to render from me. It def. aint my rig and I have an SSD solely to put MW on so it's not that either.
"This [twitter](https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist/status/1361031392939884544) thread suggests they are only just looking at it, though it's been a problem since their last big update. They don't mention it specifically in the patch notes for that release so I assumed it wasn't widespread. To add insult to injury, they then have another 2XP weekend, completely ignoring how boned the game is.

I can't believe how much time I've wasted trying to find information on this and a support link, but I suppose if there's no proper way to complain, then the problem doesn't exist, right? Screw this company, they are useless and incompetent.

But don't worry, I hear they're now banning cheats after only a year of not."
I too have wasted hours trying to find a way to fix this. . I have Ps4 and get no points. My boy has xbox he gets his points.  Needless to say He�s in the lead.
"pretty sure the last 2xp events have been warzone and cold war only, with no effect on MW multiplayer"
"It's been fixed since Friday.

https://twitter.com/RavenSoftware/status/1360257492383637507

I started getting XP after the fix, but I imagine it's still buggy for some people. and it WAS widespread - as far as I know literally no one was getting weapons xp in multiplayer for 8 days straight."
Yerp been hapening since the latest update...the only progression is when you complete daily or regular challenges.
I�m having the exact same issue.
"It gave me an in_ge update then just fixed the weapon ex and hit marker
But I still don't get any level xp also operators mission"
right they fixed Weapon XP but not match XP so yep we lost 2 dlb XP weekends for what??
Same issue.. (PS5)
Yeah PS5 here too. I only have a few weeks home leave to play and this is exactly perfectly timed with the no xp it stands over a week now. I uninstalled the game yesterday out of pure frustration.
"Well, it was broken for me too but they released a hotfix a couple days ago (friday) and now it works fine... Idk man"
Where can i find this hot fix?
"Yeah, I know a few people who don�t have the problem which is why I�m confused. If only there was a way to contact someone about it... !"
"Both my match and weapon xp have been working also, played all weekend since hotfix

Edit: on PC if that matters, not sure if its a console issue still"
"No XP unless you do daily challenges or missions, no xp also counts for Rumble cuz technically that's team deathmatch 50v50"
With less than two weeks left in the season it is ridiculous that they are not being held accountable for fixing this. It's great buying a battlepass and wondering if I will even finish it.
Theyre doing this so people will stop playing mw amd buy cw. Theyve been making this game worse and worse since cw launch.
Then I'll just play without getting xp. No way I'm going to cold war.
mate of mine sent me a screenshot yesterday of no xp after a game...
"I'm surprised not many people have brought this issue up. Hopefully, our progress has been tracking in the background, but I doubt it."
Weapon levels and camos track but still no player XP for me.
It's still fucked for me and has been for a week.
Same here I get 0 xp after every match it sucks
When is the new update coming tho sick of waiting hmmm
"I signed up to twitter so that I could contact @ATVIassist and sent them a DM. I got a single response asking me what platform I'm on and then nothing at all since, and it's been a week.

Has anything changed for anyone? Anybody had any success with ""support""?"
You have that Chronus device that people use that makes the best potato aim shooter make em look like a pro league player. Then people have have lag switch.
But that's not what it does it just helps with recoil ?
[deleted]
"No. When you say hacking you're talking about running scripts and defying actual constructs of the game (walls, damage multiplier, speed boost, no fall damage, no blast damage, hidden hit box, etc.) that can only be done on pc. On console, there is a device called a chronus people can bridge between their controller and console. It's not hacking but it's definitely not playing fair AT ALL and it's obvious when someone is using one because they have 0 missed shots every kill. Every shot lands without any visible recoil struggle from the player. Also keep in mind, killcams are reconstructed by the servers, it's not an exact replication so it can look slower or faster at times. SBMM is putting you in lobbies based on your skill, not connection so don't be quick to judge when you get domed by a flying korean either. Js"
"how you call this then ? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWEP391G-zs"
"I'm also the guy who yells hacks if I see something suspicious, never actually had a cheater on PS4 but I understand your suspicion.

I've seen friends play with mouse and keyboard on PS4 wich creates a massive advantage. He has an Warzone K/D of 2.5+ on PS4 but it also creates massive suspicion about his gameplay while in fact he just play with mouse and keyboard."
"I mean, controller have aim assist. I don't think kbm is a big advantage.  You sound a bit upset your friend is doing better than you?"
Ya Ofcourse! And Cronus is a big issue. It�s not just pc unfortunately but we get the bad rep :/
Cronus? Is that a 3rd party controller?
"Yeah I�ve also seen someone load half a clip into me on killcam and their aim barely moves, and this an SMG from 30, 40m."
Your favorite PS4/PS5 streamer is probably using a Chronus lol
Cronus zen cheating weirdos
"Most of the streams on MW are Warzone streams, and till a few months ago there wasn't a warzone category on Twitch."
Damn for so long and MW still doesn't have more followers
It�s cuz of warzone. CW is cool but all they�re money coming from warzone since it�s free to play and they pushing out dlc packs all the time. And I think MW is a great game tbh. Cold War feels overrated to me. And not by a large player base. The people who do play it swear by it but I play both and I find myself heading over to mw a lot more for the most part. Although I do like both games. But a lot of people agree that Cold War is just lackluster and needs some balancing and improvements before it has any right to be a great call of duty. MW fixed itself for the most part later on but there is still a lot of hackers unfortunately ruining the game for many people
Really? Cuz MW feels broken to me right now. Much more lag. Much more connection problems.
What was the point of this post exactly??????
"it's mw related, but I guess the point was to also get people like you who love the game so much triggered."
The answer clearly is 8
Where was the sniper rifle in the clip?
"MGS 5.

For real then you should try Arms 3 or something"
"1. No, bots are absolutely awful. I'd consider the veteran bots to be worse than the average player. They consistently got worse since the introduction of bots. In bo1 the veteran bots would laser you with 0 recoil and perfect reaction across the map, in bo2 they were already weak outside of meta guns and now they're a joke with their only skill being throwing knives

2. Nope. I do try to improve my stats even more or get nukes though and the ""challenges"" i give myself is playing with mediocre / off meta guns and nuking with it.

3. No, i don't care about the difficulty of the campaign, because it's a very one dimensional experience. Just giving opponents more hp and damage is not what i'd call an interesting experience. i'd much rather get the difficulty from other aspects in the game design, similar to dark souls. Dark Souls just punishes your mistakes and forces you to learn, but that's not happening on veteran difficulty on cod

4. Well, yes. ""Military"" just gives a good base for a competitive game. To me it's not very important that it's realistic or accurate to reality, i care more about the actual game design and balance

5. CoD is probably not what you're looking for. It's mostly arcady-ish with a tiny bit of mil-sim flavour on top. But i don't have any particular recommendations to give you, sorry"
"Bruuuuuh they aren�t meant to be there, did u expect to do the gaz missions that come in a bundle costing 2400 cp, no. These are from season 1 and unless u played then u can�t do them. Maybe u ought to check the sub or search it up before posting the exact same thing as about 500 people"
"Dude im on about missions for my already unlocked characters but the baseline ones. Its literally baseline stuff. Like only average characters unlocked from doingn stuff in game and progressing through the levels and doing coop missions.

And besides that, what does it matter what I post? Did you not see the whole reddit flood with thousands of people complaining the day they updated last time?

If I'm having an issue, I can post about it, theres nothinng wrong with that. I wanted to see if anyone else was having this issue too or if it was just my game so I'll post what I want where I want to get HELPFUL feed back."
"Yup, they�re broken for sure. Same issue I�m having."
Cause it�s a black ops game
"Black Ops is the newer game.

Modern Warfare is somewhat abandoned at this point. When you buy a CoD game, you know the game will receive support for a year at much. After that you either buy the new CoD or you're screwed.

Yeah, it really sucks that hard. I dislike CW so much.

At this point it's up the the playerbase how long the game will live."
"Even BO3 still going strong :)
But it's mostly because no active season passes."
Because something bit IW to make them not give a shit anymore. Idk how they went from supporting Infinite Warfare for years after release to dropping MW almost immediately after the release anniversary.
"It�s not that good, it�s like juggernaut mode and some other weird mode, idk maybe it changed"
"Even if Shipment or Shoot the ship was on the playlist, chances are it'll be there for a couple of weeks and you won't be levelling many guns up in that time."
In every cod people always use op guns and camp its just way of cod
yeah pretty much
"I mean ig, but it just feels different."
"People can use whatever weapons they want, but sitting in a corner with a shotgun or a riot shield? Absolutely wow. I feel for these poor people."
"I agree, it�s mostly just the style of gameplay people choose. Like they actually play like that, it�s not even to grind for weapon skins they just play like that. Idk, it�s bullshit and I don�t understand it"
"Just do what I do and wipe them with a dragunov and embarrass them then shit talk about their trash guns and make them rage quit, 10/10 experience highly recommend the feeling it gives you"
Nothing brings out rage in people more than getting killed by a Dragunov. Especially in SnD - at least once I game I hear �IS THAT A DRA-� in death comms. Sweet music.
"Might have to give that a try, lowkey. I hate using the gun but I�ll have to do that"
"There will always be people who will camp or yet be it wait for the action to come to them. 


There are different play styles there highly aggressive, campers and the area in-between. Some players who like to sweat , some who like to think , some who quick scope....etc. Not all the players in a match are going to follow the same play styles. This is what makes every game unique. Which makes it fun. 

Small maps like shipment and rust force everyone to play aggressive and it�s kind of chaotic battles of skill and movement more than strategy. 

Ground war would be the opposite most people just post up and camp because there�s more space you have to think strategical. 

Just remember everyone play is different this is the world we live in. 

Btw: I rather deal with campers and meta abusers than quick scoopers"
People will always use the best weapons and there will always be a meta and there will always be people complaining about said meta.
And I understand that it�s just annoying when everyone in every game is doing it which is why I feel there�s something different about this COD.
AX-50 quickscope is sweat too.
"I wouldn�t call it sweat naw, sure it takes skill but you�ll get shit on by plenty of reg guns. It�s just more fun to snipe than to sit in a corner and use a shotgun"
"kar or spr are much more sweaty that the ax50. i barely see anyone using it , its just kar or spr with an mp5 or as val secondary"
"Several things. While I disagree that this is the best COD since BO2, I do agree that this game does have some mechanical issues. The biggest of which is the map design in my opinion. I think the way the maps are constructed and the way the sound and perks work makes this game really easy to camp in. Between Ghost, the loud footstep audio, and the lack of ninja as a legitimate perk instead of a field upgrade, the game rewards people for finding random, dark, out of the way places and waiting for people to run by looking for a flank route so they can destroy them and go back to their spot. I can�t even imagine what playing on Piccadilly or St. Petrograd feels like in hardcore. Especially HC TDM. But I digress. While the VAL is really good, I don�t think it�s overpowered. The SPR I can see, but I think the VAL is pretty effectively balanced (especially internally, it checks itself really well). But to make a long story short, people in this game like to play like they do because this game attracts people who play like that, and since Cold War  and out, the MW community has kinda devolved in my opinion to include just the corner campers and riot shielders and shot gunners, because most of the normal players are playing either Cold War or exclusively Warzone or both now."
"I can see what you mean, and maybe it�s just because I�m so used to MW but I don�t like Cold War�s multi. It�s near impossible to snipe and it�s takes a lot to unlock weapons. Warzone is still fun but Cold War almost ruined the entire game and without a battle pass or any kind of real new update in MW it just feels like they�ve given up on MW even tho it�s their best and most popular game in a while. Just makes me hate Cold War even more"
"I am someone who ever since Black Ops 1 has loved rushing, running around shooting and scooting. Even used to be so good with melee only builds i'd win free for alls with just a ballistic knife. I've never liked being a corner camper..

&#x200B;

But this game just seems like its build especially for the corner campers, the lack of a dedicated ghost/silent perk makes it impossible to run and gun without everyone within a miles radius hearing you coming and turning to gun you down the moment you turn the corner.  Because of this even i've begun cowering in corners during matches, not wanting to move because people will hear me.. Camping just seems like the 'optimal' strategy at this point. 

The only time you can truly feel safe rushing in this game is during that 15 seconds of silence you get from your field upgrade.. And it really sucks."
"There are a million different ways to appreciate and play CoD, and that's especially true of this title. Some people enjoy winning games, others enjoy trolling the obj players. Some people play for # of kills, others for KD, and others yet for quality of kills (montage clips, highlights, funny moments, etc.). Some people enjoy the aspect of realism and mil-tactics, others enjoy bunny hopping, sliding, and drop shotting their way around the map. Just try to appreciate that all of these playstyles can exist within the same game. CDL playlist serves a purpose, and SBMM generally weeds out casual players if you're hellbent on playing your best each game.

As someone who primarily snipes and goes for clips, I can tell you that playing in higher skill level lobbies is paradoxically better that low skill because players follow predictable play patterns in their movement and class choices; I know what to expect, I build my classes accordingly, and I move through the map expecting players to be posted at the usual spots using the usual meta weapons. Maybe it's just me, but I encounter more cheese classes in casual games.

It's also worth mentioning that unlike previous MW titles, snipers are pretty underpowered in this one (aside from the marksman rifles), and you're really rewarded for picking map / game-mode specific classes. I always run a sub as my secondary in search for this reason, trying to get past the ""resorting to a machine gun is too easy"" mentality."
"Yeah I do see that, and I do have a couple classes with the ax-50 and a smg or something like that but I try to stay away from that as long as the other team aren�t using the meta guns. I go about my games in about 3 stages. 1, only use the AX-50 with a knife. 2, use a MP5 and AX-50. And then 3 is only when the other people are toxic af and I wanna just piss them off and it�ll be something like an AS Val and shotgun."
I use the famas and mp7 mostly if it makes you feel any better. I only used the spr to get it gold and then dropped it to not contribute to the problem.
Yeah I tried to use the SPR when it first got released but I found that it�s harder to use on PC cause you don�t have that aim assist and the ads speed is so fast you can�t really drag scope. So I just stick to my AX-50 which is by far my favorite gun in the game.
"If you really hate it, just play casual game modes like Capture the flag, team death match or stuff like that. It�s just the way sweaty people in any mainstream online game act."
Shoot the ship and shipment 24/7 was the soloution to this problem for me a lot of people still use them but shoot house and shipment are small enough to run round and spray the whole team sitting at the back of the map but they�ve disappeared off the playlists I only play when this 2 modes are on
Well i mostly play warzone and multi only when getting gun gold
Honestly wish that was a permanent mode cause those are the best 2 maps in the game aside from maybe Rust.
"I literally feel you dude. I was playing a team of camping bitches using subs when we said 100 times snipers only. Then it got to 1-5, 4/6 teammates left and we said fuck these kids and my buddy and I came back against 2v6 for 5 rounds and won, followed by a scream sesh in the mics afterwards"
awesome. different music maybe?
"Thanks! i was just trying different music, Ill change next time"
Wow how i can do that?? nice try to use different music next time
"its actually quite simple but time consuming. I just put each clip 2 seconds after the other. For example, i counted each frame from when the execution started and made tabs. The first clip is from 0-10 ms of the execution, the second is 10-20, the third is 20-30 and so on."

"I absolutely love the intro sequences that Modern Warfare introduced to the COD series. I hope they bring this back for their new game, with more variety please!"
"A nice touch to avoid the classic ""standing and waiting for the game to start"""
"The infils are definitely a nice touch.

I especially love the infil animation on Crash when your team starts at the top of the hill � you get a really neat descending view of the full map right before the chopper lands and everyone hops out.

I hope MW2021 features reboots of Bailout and Favela � those would be rad to look at during an infil landing.

Bailout was so much fun with that spot where you could jump out the window and camp on the roof lol"
"I personally love the helicopter infil on Gun Runner, just wish it was a bit longer."
Someone modded MW2 to add an infil to Favela. Actually looked really awesome. They used some animations from the Gulag mission of the campaign for the helicopter landing. It was very cool
"When I'm playing MW and I'm in a shit mood, as the guy gives you the signal to drop, I throw him the middle finger. I'll miss doing that if they don't have it in the next game."
"Okay, but when you�re inserted with the van, a guy jumps out, waves everyone out, then jumps back into the van.

WHY DIDN'T YOU JUJU ON THAT BEAYT??!?
Does anyone know why the gun is pointed off to the side? You would think the most optimal position to terrify someone is is at the forehead.

But the thing is no one cares bud
WHAT GAME IS THE ANIME CHICKS IN!
MW2
Mw19 is better imo
Without a doubt.
"no broken ass game, killstreaks are insanely unbalanced"
COD 2.
I mean. Do we have to even ask this question anymore. MW is just better. End of story
"Sir, you are in a modern warfare sub. I mean, cold war is worse than mobile games but that's like asking who wins? Naruto or Goku in a Dragon Ball group"
WW2
"you mean, which is a better game? because neither of them are the best cod game"
Haha. Just answer the question. Sigh.
"people really never played the better CODs and it shows, you�re not wrong brother both games are very annoying to play"
Yea true. But just of curiosity. Which one do you think  is the best?
"i think y'all are going a little too hard on cold war, overall it's a great game with a kick ass campaign and a good multiplayer"
The multiplayer is not good and it's a 70$ game.
any cod game before infinite warfare
Modern warfare is good tho
Lulz
"Black Ops 2

Why is it not even an option?"
"Because I'm comparing the two ""big"" CID games at the moment."
Kar is already a hitmarker machine nerfing it would make it worse than the fucking glock
Nerf the aim assist on them atleast lol
"Without a doubt, they do. 

Lupua mags for the SPR need to catch a fat nerf. They allow the SPR to be build for purely ADS / sprint out, while maintaining sniper rifle damage (waist up one hit). That�s not okay. 

This is before we talk about the ridiculous amount of aim assist of iron marksmen rifles, Focus being stupid, or how good mouse players have the most ridiculous point a click gun, ever. Drastically increasing the ADS penalty on Lupua mags would be a good place to start. Reducing the one hit area would also be good. 

The Kar is a little bit more fair since the �one hit area� is smaller (this leads to more hit markers), but it�s still ridiculous. Reverting the last buff would likely be enough."
Don�t we dare nerf the Kar or SPR.. again
Absolutely stupid how you can build it with smg-like ads speeds at point blank range. Needs a nerf.
While I think quickscoping or any form of sniping should only reward you when you get a headshot and not a shot on any other part of the body. If they did that all snipers and marksmen would be beyond useless with the already fast ttk.
"This is about the SPR and Kar, don't drag the other Marksman rifles into this.  


The thought of nerfing the Crossbow and EBR14, just because people are mad at the SPR/Kar, is ridiculous."
Y�all who are saying the kar and spr need a nerf are just mad bc you can�t Quick scope
"Anyone who says no have no clue. Kar was considered op in MP before they gave us ads buff. Spr with lapua has sniper level consistent one shot but not their aim punch and marksman level mobility. You go into any top pc search lobby, it's sprs.

Think of it this way, they're in a cat with xbow and ebr, how are they even balanced for their own group let alone vs snipers."
How tf do u get a tank
You can use the tank killstreak on that map and arklov peak (however that's spelled lol)
I wish they would just add a vote screen like in other games
The map is bad even in survival because buy stations are all located 999 fucking light years away
This could've been 25 seconds shorter and nothing would've been lost. Like the did entire loading screen have to be included?
"I�m sorry, I didn�t think it would be problem, that is my fault, I do apologize"
I dunno I quite liked the suspense.
Jynx! You owe me a soda
lol was that just by chance?
Yes sir yes it was
It's not  a reload and this is way too long.
"Yeah, it�s an inspect my dumbass put reload, and I thought the video wasn�t that long but I guess it is, I do apologize"
How was you getting stadium in multiplayer maps????
It�s a gunfight map
It was from one of the gunfight playlists where you play 3v3 or 4v4 moshpit modes
"Day 4 after the update, still doesn't work for me.

While you're at it, please bring back shoot the ship ffs."
Thats another thing i dont understand. Why does CW always have a nuketown 247 playlist but mw doesnt have a shoot the ship 247 playlist..
They want you to play warzone or cold war
Mw/warzone. For CW everything works just fine.
[deleted]
Unforgivable at this point. Waiting over a week for a fix that should take 2 minutes.
"I haven�t been getting XP in multiplayer or warzone for a week now, so frustrating!!"
I�ve been getting nothing for two weeks now. Makes it pointless to play in my opinion. Just bought the game for 80$ and incredibly frustrated with 0 xp for every match played.
Youre not alone.. not that it makes it any better. Its just soooo frustrating
"Yep. When I played yesterday the bug was still in te game. Right now, my game crashes when I click on ""quick play""??? I'm on ps4 slim btw..."
It got fixed for me but now since a day no xp on mw. I'm tired it now
"Wait, weapon XP in MW multiplayer is fixed?"
All i can tell you about that is that you can get camos. I have all the guns to max level. A friend of mine said that its fixed tho.
"Weapon XP fixed, player XP still broken."
Yeah literally getting 1-2k xp for a 30kill ground war gameplay all the time..
Im getting xp since yesterday. It is fixed for me
Anyone elses aim assist broken? Mine doesn't travel with my targets or remotely lock on when aiming right at them for a second. Miss half my shots now.
Before the patch my aim assist wasnt working at all. Now mine is working again.
"Nope. Don't get me wrong i would say yes but right now there is about a 50/50 chance you won't get xp cause of some dumbass bug that isn't getting fixed. And well for a new player that means no attachments on your guns, which means you straight up wont have a good time.

Now when they fix that bug? 100% worth the buy."
This right here I just got the game to play multiplayer and over 2 days I've only just hut lvl 4. Just no motivation to play if I only get xp from challenges which need you to have custom classes
"Yes. It�s a top-tier game with a massive fucking player base. Gunplay: amazing, customization: amazing. You can have completely different play styles and hours of racking up kills with one build on a gun, switch it up with the same gun, and have a whole new experience. Several times over. Maps: nothing to write home about but still solid. The fun part about maps that aren�t perfect is learning to be an above average player on them. Those redditors who rip this game to shreds about bugs that do not directly affect your ability to kill the player you are shooting at *might* have nothing more important in their life than this game. Get the game if you can afford to buy it twice."
"No new content, No more Seasons, No Anticheat, CW just got out and they are already making new COD game rn so even less support for MW. I would say save ur money dude. Play Warzone its FTP."
"Not in its current broken state no.

If they ever pull their heads out of their asses and restore XP gain in multiplayer, then fuck yes."
Buy it!!! Cold War sucks balls!!
"lmao I tried to be positive when playing it, and some fun was had but I mean honestly..... yeah you RIGHT! it kinda sucked balls"
"Dude this is Warfare, games absolutely worth it BUT at sale it's like 50% cheaper and there's no content rn so I'd wait"
"Honestly, I�ve been waiting for �The Bog,� �Showdown,� and �Crossfire� maps for over a year. Good game, but I really wish they�d give us more content with the new seasons."
"Abs not. 

Sp: locked online, frequent dcs that won't save your progress bc of shitty activision servers. 

MP: terrible map pool and match making. You're also going to be behind everyone who's got everything unlocked while you don't. Cheaters are also more prevalent. 

Coop: less population, low amount of games that won't start unless there's 4. You could be waiting for 30 min for a game."
"buy it when it�s on sale, absolutely not with the price in it�s current state."
It is the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. Def biased here but I'd say yes.
"I wouldn't say, for me it never was, it's slow as Ghosts and full of noob friendly stuff, you get lasered by campers with no time to react, the spawns are still broken as fuck, the other day I saved a game of me going negative for spawning around 15 times in 10 minutes two steps away from an enemy on Kill Confirmed, and finally the meta weapons (AS-VAL, CR-56 Amax) are completely broken, to the point that you can't compete against them no matter what, and they aren't going to balance them as they've been this way for months.

I'd say if you want a new game go for CW, frustrating at times but at least you can move around without worrying too much about campers and you can react thanks to the longer TTK, and zombies is just superior to special ops."
No. Not at all. No new content because they're focusing on Cold War and Warzone. Constant bugs. And they seem to be neglecting the base multiplayer pretty bad. It'll only get worse as the year goes on and we approach yet another COD release. They haven't given an ETA on when they're bringing back the old seasons content as far as I'm aware either. So your best bet is to save money unless you just want to pay 60 bucks for nothing new to be added and a multiplayer that gets broken with each update.
"From someone who just bought it and have been dealing with the no XP bug, no. Not worth it."
It�s on sale for 45
If absolutely wait for a sale. It�s basically a paid advertisement for cold war now.
"This looks like a setting. Maybe you clicked streamer mode, although i dont know if that exists on cod lol but you could still check"
It exists on MW. Idk about rest.
You have streamer mode turned on in settings
thanks ill didnt think i did last time i looked but ill check again.
Always so much fun to mess around in costum game
Buddy that�s a public 3v3 gunfight lol his team had left him so I asked him to set up for a trick shot
"Hey, just a heads up: You covered your # identifier but at the end of the video, the white bar faded leaving the number out in the open (it�s like at the last frame)"
Thanks man! When editing this I realized how many f�in times it displays my player number. Whack.
If you�re going for shotguns for Damascus then you do not need to do the JAK-12 and VLK
"If you think the VLK is bad....its probably just you being bad.  

It has decent OHK potential and double the fire rare of the 680."
"You need to play hardcore for shield, pistol and shotgun camos man"
"Shield and pistol, yes to certain extent, but I platinumed the shotties entirely in core mode and I�m not even that great a player."
its trash without dragons breath unfortunately its a pita to grind the longshots w.o shipment
"what?

&#x200B;

the vlk with dragons breath is the best"
Hardcore
Nay. I love it. So fun to use. If you search immarksman on YouTube for that gun he's got few fun videos with it.  It's really fun to use but you need the db.
It's good with slugs.
You don�t need to do the VLK rogue
That gun is so poopoo
You dont need VLK for diamond shotguns tho
"I have too but as you say, I can�t complete any of them"
"Question, have you gotten tier 100 battle pass and purchased it?"
Quite the loadout
Love Bring out your dead. Awesome clip dude!
Thanks!!!
Yeah those are the challenges for Mara for her season 1 skins I rarely see her much
"Did you get and max out the season 1 battle pass? If not, no they�re not supposed to be there, it�s a bug that was introduced in the last update"
It's a bug. They're not completing. Don't waste your time.
"MP7 is best out of those options but people really be sleeping on the ISO, I dropped a 20 bomb with it."
"Neither. 
I'm a p90 dude."
"I am a PP-19 user, I don�t know why I like it so much, but I feel like us high-capacity players should stick together."
Respect. I was going 21-3 and 3 with it before my game decided to crash.
P90 shreds especially close range. Can't blame you!
"Don't get me wrong the ISO is fun to use but the MP7 has damage, speed, range and its basically a laser beam. I countersnipe with that thing! Bonus point for slick ironsight.

Fennec is anoying to play against but i won't even bother unlocking it. The MP7 is just too good."
"MP7 > Fennec >>>> ISO

MP7 is mostly easy to use and high mobility, very easy to get headshots with. It's not the best SMG, nor second best, but it's kinda up there

Fennec is decent up close, but not insane. At range it gets a bit painful though, so i don't see much benefit in using it beyond just feeling like it

ISO is the worst SMG in the game. Do yourself a favour and just replace it by a P90 or something"
"Fennec-  bad  
Mp7  - boring laser beam tryhard weapon  
ISO -  most excitingestest smg after the Striker. good allrounder."
"I like the Fennec, but I can't deny the MP7 is just much better rounded. The Fennec really only does one thing well- CQC rushes. The MP7 can do it all, depending on how you build it.  


The ISO is trash, and imo is the worst gun in the game. Even at release the ISO was pointless."
"Fennec is ridiculous close range and ISO has some impressive range, but that�s really all they can do. They�re brought down by other factors: Fennec is very slow and has poor range, ISO loses to most guns up close, etc. 

MP7 is a solid SMG. Nice recoil pattern, good RoF, clean irons, etc. Really only held back by the top tier guns just simply being better. It�s versatility and ease of use makes it better than the other two."
"You don't have the right fennec build imo
Try ZLR Saber, apex barrel, commando Forgrip, drum mag, tac laser"
"I love using a longer range mp7 and getting reactions as I long range laser ppl. Best one was ""No, the MP7 does not las"" then it cut off."
"Striker-45, Uzi, & AUG all day"
Aug with 55
CX-9
"Nice clip, but try posting it to r/warzone as well so it can hopefully get more attention"
"Good point, I may try posting it there a little bit later."
I did mine in headquarters when shipment wasn't available. Sometimes I'd go into free for all though and ask in game text chat if anyone could help me. Sometimes people are kind enough to help out. You're right to do it in hard core also.
I'll have to try FFR and see if there are any good Samaritans. I'm about to just force my brother to plunder farm with me like I did to get launchers gold.
"Play objective modes like hard point or domination and put the camouflage you�re grinding on that shield.  (That tells us you�re grinding if we didn�t see the chat message)

Add a trophy system for those who spam the Semtex and thermite, it won�t stop all of them but it will help.

Take breaks every so often and run a different load out as it keeps you from burning out.  When you get the gold it will be worth it.  Most my camouflage came from regular playing, but the skulls was the hardest with my shield.

Try running some in core if you�re not finding much luck in hardcore.  But tell people you�re grinding and it you�ll find this of us willing and who�ve been there like me.

Check my post and comment history for more as there was a lot of advice I received along the way."
Thanks!
Honestly without StS you have to just get lucky in Hardcore TDM
So in other words I'm fucked. Idk If I have the mental capacity for it
There may be a shoot the ship week in the end of season.
Just save it for hc shipment and if u like to lose ur mind just play hc Hardpoint and keep camping inside the Hardpoint
"I'm assuming you're talking about the 3 kills without dying. I had my best luck in shoot house. It is a horrible grind but once it's done it's worth it. I ran a trophy system played the objective until I got 1 easy kill, then i would retreat a bit and see if i could get 2 more."
All you can see is gun and head
Stir crazy did show a lot of the maps not in the core filter do work fine in 10v10. I'm playing less and less these days due to boredom because of the lack of 10v10 playlists and they are the same maps over and over.
"Never played stir crazy, but that sounds about right. I always figured a lot of the 6v6 maps would work just fine in 10v10. Because I know I hated maps like Khandor and Ramaza on 6v6, but really enjoyed them on 10v10. I feel maps like Piccadilly and Azhirs cave wouldn�t be so bad in 10v10. Kinda wish CoD would just bring back 9v9 ground war. Always felt like the perfect size to me, and you didn�t need special maps for it."
Petition: Aniyah Palace 15v15 or even 20v20
"It was fun in 24v24 GW back when MW first came out.

I miss 32+ players on smaller maps from CoD4. As an example Broadcast with 40+ players was pure chaos but fun: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCiMKChDFBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCiMKChDFBM)"
I think if they made a 20v20 Aniyah Palace playlist I�d check it out. Couldn�t be worse then some of the other stuff they�ve thrown our way..
30 v 30
"This game's kinda depressing on how it could've been a modern classic but it has so many small to big problems that make it such a drain to play.  This map issue makes no sense.  Get it to GW, get incursion to 10v10."
Fuck that map
"They don�t care, they don�t want you getting more than 8 kills in 10 minutes. A lot of the maps suffer this issue and they know that"
"I had fun running and slide cancelling in this map... That's the real use of this map. Running marathon

But seriously i had fun flanking a lot of people literally yesterday"
They fucking want to kill MP.. Its sickening.
*please take aniyah palace out of modern warfare
Tactical insertion is your best friend in this map.
And then when they tried to fix it with Aniyah Incursion they made it a 6v6 map when it still should have been a 10v10.
Please take Aniyah Palace out of the game because it's a complete fail of a map
�Please take Aniyah Palace out of the game� FTFY
This game would be so much better if the standard maps were all 10v10 and the larger ones 20v20. I even remember seeing a 20v20 mode in the press reveal for this game
"I used to never back out despite hating Palace with a passion.

Now that XP is permanently out of the game, I back the FUCK out whenever I see that ass of a map. If I'm not gonna have any fun, at least let me earn XP. No fun AND no XP? Palace is officially retired in my eyes."
Yea that map is really my least favorite map. Also I never see Euphrates bridge anymore. I know people really hated that map because of the sniping but I really enjoy countersniping so I�m sad I never play it
Wym XP is out of the game? I haven�t played mw recently so I�m confused.
"I can't handle with this either bro , this map GW map why put it in 10vs10 and infected , like this issues from day one (game release) and still here ... I love 10vs10 but when I saw this i backout then i keep get already games started when i finally get game from beginning I get this map like wtf (sry about bad english i make my best to be better everyday)"
Quads are fun.
"its such a lazy map, its just a portion of a ground war map -\_-"
Normal size maps should be on 10v10 I don't care what anyone says bring back the OG Ground war.
"They didn�t listen to the player base when the game was in its prime, do you really think they are going to listen when it isn�t?"
"Yes please. Replace it with Incrusion that actually is good sized for it.

u/artpeasant

Sorry for tagging you, but I feel like this has been a common request for the whole year."
I like most of the maps in MW except Aniyah Palace.
"People have asked for this since day one. It will not be done.

They will not remove SBMM, they will not add a map filter, they will not add a map vote, they will not add a server browser, they will not have set playlists that stick around, they will not properly communicate with the players because someone was mean to them on Twitter once, they will not remove/add any maps and they don't give a fuck anymore.

Does that about cover it ?

These posts as much as I personally agree with them in spirit are just so naive at this point."
It sucks in TDM and KC but I actually really enjoy Anyiah on Headquarters.
When people don�t feel like grinding Damascus so they steal yours instead.
2FA
2 factor authentication.
"Yup. It can and does happen. 

Like others said - two factor. Do it."
"Enable 2 fa on your accounts, and pick a strong randomized password, like a lastpass password generator etc.

As further precausion, you could also unlink and relink your accounts to your activision account so ppl who hack yours can't unlink it, but I doubt it's efficacy."
"Yep ! I have (or I had now) Damas, DM ultra and Dark aether. All gone the 10th after a guy stole my account :/"
"""At some point"" weapons.

They've been in Survival for awhile now, with no word on a game-wide release"
"I don�t think we�ll ever see these really officially, the devs left this game in the dust."
"If you've bought the game on another PS account, go on that account and search for the packs there. They should be available there."
"I tried this, it didn't work unfortunately

On the other account, if you go under game content management it just says ""currently 12 game packs are installed"" and it won't let me do anything else"
"Came here to say this. My brother and I share two consoles in our house. I have to sign in to both consoles to finish the install on both. If you bought it on disc, this might not solve it."
"Hey, I went through a lot of trouble because of this issue too. I downloaded mw on a hard drive on the ps4 and downloaded all the packs on the ps4. After all the packs are downloaded on the hard drive, it should be ready to go on the ps5"
Do you have crossplay on?
Yes
Set your party to friends only or private
They can join through recent players when you start matchmaking. If you block them on MW it'll never put them back in the same lobby
"Not completely true. You can be put into a lobby with blocked players, but a pop up will appear saying something along the lines of ""A player on your/you have blocked is in the lobby. Would you like to stay? Y/N?"""
Can't answer that but just wanna say any of you doing this type of shit can get fucked.
Xbox used to have a feature where you could mark a player and have it more likely or less likely for you to get matched up with again. I kinda wish all online mp games would have that feature
"Maybe it was random and sadly unlucky for
you since it was 12 hours later regardless I think your best bet is to report and block them.Toxic players suck."
Pretty sure you can set your party to open/invite/closed/friends only
"I�m sorry, that shit happens to me too as a female player, the spamming chat, party invites and the requests over and over after. I think you can go to recently played in social and try to join games of people you recently played a match with or against. I don�t know if there�s a setting but usually i just block them right away bc im lazy. They even try a week later. It�d be cool if some other players stood up for the female players when they hear them going off... because leaving us high and dry during the whole match doesn�t mean your a good dude, means you�re still a part of the issue. It�s hot when guys speak up to other guys about sexist shit. Don�t be some knight or anything, but why don�t they see that? I feel you though, battle on though, don�t stand down to these fools."
"I�m sorry to hear that this happens to you as well. By far my worst experience on the game. As a 15 year old girl I really didn�t appreciate hearing sexual advances towards me from grown men. The fact that they continued even after stating I�m a minor is not okay, I wish there were more men who educated themselves about these things. Like you said, it is attractive when guys stand up for women on the game! Thank you for the words, I really needed that after yesterday. <3"
"I very rarely play SnD, and have voice chat disabled 90% of the time. So I can't hear any of the toxicity. Most people don't have headsets with a mic on, might be a much higher number in SnD though."
Sorry you had to deal with that. On a happier note I found your reddit name pretty funny lmao.
HAHA thank you man!!
"I used to get a lot of this, especially the last few months, up until I started playing with my brother more often (funny enough he introduced me to call of duty way back on the ps2 and he just kinda stopped playing for years until recently). 

The man's got the potential to be either a voice actor or stand up comic cause every time someone hits on me he throws on a thick southern accent and says something along the lines of ""Sorry mister y'ain't getting my sister till she done have my baby"" and they either bust up laughing or fuck right off.



Funny enough even though I have the calling card equipped none of them realize I'm actually trans. /shrug"
"Hahahaha, your brother is an actual legend! That�s hilarious. Past few days on the game have been really rough, I just have to thank you for putting a smile on my face :)"
"I hate this shit! I just block straight away. It�s not fun. I love playing SnD/cyber and it really helps giving call outs. But it puts me off playing as I know they�ll always be some idiot that chimes in when you say you�re a girl. I find it�s most toxic when you�re playing against clans. It�s always the same �back to the kitchen� joke followed by some gross sexual remarks.

EDIT: I always find in SnD and cyber you often play with similar people and I recognise a lot of usernames, so chances are you just happened to be put in a game with him. I don�t think he joined your game, you were probably just unlucky. I think it alerts you when someone joins your game with you."
"Yup, that clan part is totally accurate! If I see 4 of the same clan tag I usually back out. Very bad habit of mine. I�m learning to handle what people say to me and if that comes with blocking and reporting I�ll do it. Currently thinking of comebacks for �go back to the kitchen� so I can turn my mic on and defend myself for the first time haha

EDIT: Makes sense. I did notice that but when I play with similar players it�s usually only for a couple of games and never hours later. But I don�t doubt that�s what happened. I met a different group twice on the same day as the other assholes and I was pleasantly surprised when they were happy to see me again!"
"Its most likely just a coincidence. I've played against a group of people many times, it just happens. They are of a similar skill and live in a good proximity to you so the matchmaking puts you in the same match.

If you block them, when that happens again, the game will notify you that a person you blocked is in the same lobby."
"If your party type is open, they can absolutely join and play. 
This used to be a strat- find a new skill player, join them and stomp all over their lobbies.  
Set to private / invite only will prevent this."
"Yes people can join in progress MP games from your profile. It's a pretty common boosting strategy, as in old CODs with persistent lobbies youd be in the lobby but not the party, so often end up on different teams for the next game. Can still be done in this COD if you get placed in the other team IIRC (unless it always puts you in their team now)"
I've gotten 0 xp in over a week now not enough people are talking about this its ridiculous
Agreed. I�ve tried looking it up and I can�t really find anyone else complaining about it
"That's what folks were complaining about on Cold War trying to level up guns but struggling with a intense SBMM and really slow XP. This integration with CW has been the worst thing to happen. I just starting tinkering with the Kar and SP-R, and during the MW seasons it was fairly quick to unlock specs on a gun. Nowadays it takes forever, and the battle pass needle barely moves no matter how well you do. Cold War is the worst thing to happen. A shame too cuz it could have been complimentary to MW for those that prefer more action."
I haven�t bought Cold War and I�ll never buy Cold War so I don�t know the leveling up
Yep! And of you know they won�t fix it. Won�t even address it. Need to award thousands and thousands of unearned XP. It�s ridiculous.
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
"Not working for me either (ps4). Cant lvl up, do not get any xp from kills, just get ""elimination"" . Will stop playing until this fixed."
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
They removed XP from Modern Warfare late in the battle pass to encourage purchase of Cold War
"perhaps this ""xp bug"" is to push MW players to CW.  the season is coming to an end soon, so if xp is working for CW, you gotta play CW to finish off your battle pass.  dick move."
You serious? Imma lose it if that�s true
"Haven't received XP in a long time, yet new patches allow you to buy new skins. COD is pretty disgusting."
"im on ps4. i�m having the same exact problem, super lame. just came back to the game and now i cant level up any weapon

Edit: works for me now"
I�m on ps4 as well. I wonder if that has anything to do with it?
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
Everyone is complaining about it on one of the cod discord servers
What are you playing?
Hardcore TDM
"Same here, barely leveled up but 2 levels after playing 2 hours of hardcore"
Have you tried core?
"We played 39 rebirths, and my wife hardly made it too level 7. You know they won�t fix it either. And if they do, there will be no compensation. Even though they have all the records of each game. The app says we get XP, but it�s not awarded."
[deleted]
You�re getting normal xp? I�ll get normal xp 1 in ever 20 rounds maybe
My sis sat in a two hour queue today about something else but I had her ask about XP... apparently there is no word on when they will be fixing it and to just watch social media like Twitter? Great cool
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
How are some of y�all even getting Xp? I haven�t gotten not 1 xp since the stupid update...and I�ve played a solid 60 games before I gave up
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
"Only way I can get any XP is on Coop missions, multiplayer isnt giving me jack"
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
>it has been fixed for me and my friends (mp PC)
Yes it�s happening to everyone atm
6751 exp I went 20-8 maxed out on battle pass level 100
When? I just went 26-3 and got 375 xp
It�s a  heliflopter
Mating season is wild on rebirth Island
"Well, I mean it is reBIRTH Island"

i really hope that�s the case
"That�s just what happens when you have extremely competitive sbmm. It�s fun and casual until you start to improve then people play the game super slow and cheesy, spam kill streaks, etc"
"Sbmm. Maybe you got on a streak that boosted your stats violently, making the games sweater until you get back into your ""comfort zone"""
"that makes sense. it�s never been this bad tho, almost feels like Cold War"
"Bro this is like the fourth of fifth thread on the subject I've seen since Thursday. Folks told me it was because the casuals have moved onto CW, and the player pool has shrunk. Personally I'm of the belief that whatever algorithm that exists in CW, has been introduced to MW. Seems like the game got more sweaty since CW introduced League Play. I'd always get in the top 3 or 4 in any mode, but lately I'm fighting for my life on these Call of Duty streets. It's gotten campier lately too."
this is exactly what i�m going through. campers everywhere. every game i go into has a faze atlanta skin sweat with an spr.
It's probably skill based matchmaking like I'm literally a level 31 in multiplayer and I'm getting paired up with people that are max rank and all this bullshit. I struggle to even get six to seven kills a game I shouldn't get punished because I got a fucking eight kill streak one time and now every single game afterwards is full of fucking pros.
"I have an average to an above average kd and every game i get into at least half the enemy team is running overkill with 725's, r9's as vals, etc. And ive ran into a shit ton of campers and it's rly getting on my nerves"
"bro i�ve seen people run dragons breath on shipment, it�s so cancer"
The games exactly the same with only diff being more op weapons and more trash maps from s6 in the pool.
Why does everyone hate broadcast? Easily one of the best maps in the game imo
It�s easy use dead silence run up behind someone then crouch before you kill them.
"You can only use dead silence every once in a while, and dying just wastes it"
Slide kills count as crouching
They don�t. Low blow is a low blow. It does not count as a crouched kill
I can�t remember the last time I was killed by a knife that wasn�t sliding. Has to be the easiest way.
Slide cancelling. Or crouch just before killing someone
Start camping
Nah I don�t want to ruin the game for other people just so I can get a camo for a knife
"Yup, known glitch, no idea if these fuckboi�s are even going to bother to fix it. I haven�t gotten xp in over a week."
Same its out of hand not enough people are complaining
Apparently it�s tons of people. As we are having the same problem right now.
"They not gonna fix it, force us buy/play cw."
They removed XP from Modern Warfare late in the battle pass to encourage purchase of Cold War.
Are you joking? I thought it was a bug
Should�ve been around when it could shoot through walls. That was really fun.
I was. it was painful.
"I won�t lie, I used it when it was broken. I don�t think I�ve ever felt more power than that meta."
"Not gonna lie I had some real fun with that when playing private sessions with my buddies. They don't follow the latest on CoD, they just play. I had to fess up like halfway through the evening but it was fun while it lasted haha."
"Was awesome. Outside of Search and Destroy and Hardcore it was fine. Now it�s 100% useless. 

Edit: I�m specifically talking about the 10rd armor piercing bullets in case there is confusion."
"The MP5 was considered OP, and it killed in 3 bullets, at 830 RPM, out to 13 meters. The AS VAL shoots at 930 RPM, and 3 shots out to 30 meters. It�s fucking busted. And I don�t wanna hear this �only 30 rounds� excuse, because the MP5 with 10mm only had 30 rounds, and that was a fairly common setup.

Same with the SPR. Shit can one hit from the waist up, and can ADS fast as fuck. Without a scope, 290 ms, and with one, up to 340. My kilo, with Prowler, Mono, Tac, Stippled and 50 rounds will ADS in 307ms. Obviously my Kilo is on the slow side and meant for low recoil, but unless I�m using 100 rounds, why the fuck should an iron sights sniper be faster than an iron sights AR? 

Even if you spec out the kilo, or anything that�s not the FAL or FAMAS for full ADS time, you add in the TTK of hitting your shots, and it will always lose to the SPR at any range.

They dropped those 2 guns on us and just dipped. Leaving us with this annoying garbage.

Edit: Guys, I�m not saying you�re gonna go 100 and 0 with an SPR. Something can over-perform, or be OP and not get a lot of kills. The numbers I provided show that. It over performs in CQB. I don�t think it takes a CoD pro to take advantage of that either. You don�t need shroud aim, the hit box is pretty big.

Edit:2 As you can see, I�m on PC. Aiming with a sniper is literally as easy as aiming an SMG for me. There�s no removal of aim assist as a nerf for me. So take that into consideration. Even then, I played controller for a long time, and don�t really recall sniping in MW2 or BO2 being that hard."
Yeah but they get one shot. It rewards players for being accurate.
Mp5 controls like an smg. Val does not
The SPR gets hitmarkers galore unless it�s a good class. And I think it got nerfed
"Not to mention that 3 shot can be boosted to 41m with a healthy Velocity increase with a barrel that has barely any ADS penalty.

The reload speed is one of the fastest in the game for full auto weapons. So SOH is arguably not needed at all. 

And the slightly difficult recoil is medicated with a stock attachment."
Exactly what I've been saying about the mp5 since launch. I'd rather get killed by the val a million times over than die to the mp5 one more time. When they make a very slight nerd to a gun and the entire cdl freaks out because its the only gun they use then you know its a problem
"the MP5 is worse in almost every single way than the As Val. MP5 is balanced against the other choices in the game like M4, AUG, MP7, Galil, Ram, etc. AS Val on the other hand is a slap in the face"
AND it's suppresed!
"AS Val is an issue. The gun is ridiculous. Three shot kill with that rate of fire shouldn�t exist.

Making it a four shot kill (without headshots) is the easiest was to balance the gun without ruining it, but I�m not sure we�ll ever see another balance patch with WZ being the focus. 

Would also like to see guns like the SPR, Fal, and Amax catch some nerfs. While guns like the Bizon catch some buffs. Likely to never happen, but would be lovely."
"Yeah the SPR/AMAX etc are a nuisance, but I have no problem outplaying those guns against 99% of players. The VAL however is blatantly broken and I occasionally get beaten by it when I absolutely shouldn�t and it�s maddening. If they nerf the Val I can live with the rest."
"Amax recoil should be nerfed and maybe its range reduced a bit, focus perk needs to be nerfed in Kar98 and SPR and guns like Holger, MG34, Bizon, Dragunov need some buffs"
"It throws off the MP5. Its a powerful, light gun, with a fast rate of fire at the cost of a heavy kick of recoil but a small mag size. This gun definitely dominates in Hardcore and will do alright in core but it suffers at longer ranges"
"it doesnt just do alright in core, it dominates everything up to 30-40 meters."
"Just remain calm and carry on. Keep running your QS DMR's and I'll keep running my broken VAL. 

*Fun Fact: Not that this matters for MW, but the AS VAL is actually a sub-sonic DMR designed for concealability for Russian Spec-Ops assignments. The rapid fire was add as a last resort means for unplanned CQC engagement*s."
I know you did not just throw a IRL fact into a video game discussion to explain why it�s broken LMAO
vss configuration with the 4x scope and the marksman stock was the dmr. the as val is an AR designed for much closer ranges
I don't think it's that broken. It still has quite a bit of recoil to justify the damage imo
Warzone is the main priority now and as we�d both agree the val is pretty balanced in that mode. Any time I have went back to mw multiplayer to unlock stuff for WZ it�s not too bad the first game or two but after that it�s just Val central and everybody is using it. I�m not going to say their sweats or annoying because why wouldn�t you use the statistical best gun in the game. Something does need to happen with the Val but I can�t imagine anything will now.
The headshot multiplier is pretty OP
the only nerf they did to that thing was with the sleight of hand back when it released the reload time was way shorter than what it is now
When the gun came out I said that it's broken (not talking about the SPP ammo bug but the normal gun as it is right now) and people wanted to riot. Probably because they found a no skill gun that they can drop everyone with. Now those people have moved onto cold war so the conversation is different.
"Damn, I remember the old m4, is this worse? I haven't played since the integration, then the game just fell apart for me."
"its pretty broken and needs a ttk nerf, but they wont do anything because mw19 is ded basically."
WHAT THE HELL I JUST GOT MODERN WARFARE AND I NEVER LOOKED IT UP ON REDDIT AND NOW IM GETTING MODERN WARFARE NOTIFICATIONS!? IS REDDIT STALKING ME!?
probably
The SPR or any sniper rifle that can quick scope and used as a shotgun is super busted and has been for years.
your going to hate the m4 10 round mag
"About the smg vs Sniper. A Sniper hitting a target has a stronger bullet force than any other AR/SMG so yes it will out perform those guns at any range in direct confrontation. Now the sniper has to actually land that shot, and to land the shot you have to actually aim correctly, and for that you need to ADS. That's maybe the only thing, the ADS is too fast on the SPR, but not the damage/OHK."
"> there is just no beating it. 

\**Laughs in shotgun / quickscope*\*"
"Yes, the VAL needs to be nerfed BADLY. I didn't use it for the first couple months after it came out, but eventually I decided to go for gold on it since I kept getting beaten by lower skill players that were just using an unfair gun. 

I'm a PC M&K player, my overall KD is 1.90. With the AS VAL, I was able to achieve 2.75-3.0KD on that weapon. For comparison, I consider myself fairly skilled with the FAL, which is my second best gun, around a 2.15KD. I think even the FAL is overpowered and should never have been buffed. But that goes to show the ridiculousness of the VAL. 

And for those who say the recoil is enough to balance it out...perhaps you're a console player? I'm not sure, but I can still get longshots at 60M, sometimes out to 80M. Sure it's not quite as good as the other AR's, but for just about any multiplayer map, it's plenty. The recoil is easy enough to control. 

Also worthy of mention, I'm a core player, as I've seen some people claim it's not as good in core. It may only have 30 round mags, but I can still clear 3-4 people at close range if I don't miss my shots."
"As a console player, I am definitely not getting long shots with that gun, unless someone is super open and I can burst fire at them. On bigger open maps I definitely do not use that gun. How does it compare to 725, spr, and dragons breath? I hear a lot more hate for those guns than for the as Val when playing cyber attack. Then again maybe if I was better at the game and actually killed people, I�d get some hate haha"
"Ye it's really sad, for example look at oden, extremely quick time to kill due to the 2 shot kill, but then its such a slow weapon to use it's just not as viable. As val handles like an smg, like what were they thinking and why is this not getting addressed?"
play hc and every gun is viable.
no sane person wants to play hardcore
"So is the mp5, so is the m4, so is the spr, so is the kar.  They aint gonna nerf anything for a long time."
"MP5 and M4 are not op though, lmao. Especially not the M4, it's not even the best AR.. Also not 2nd best, also not 3rd best and probably not 4th best either."
i think that it dies need a nerf to fire rate
"That gun is tbh one of the most OP guns a CoD game can ever have. It made both the M4 and the MP5 look like a joke. And the rest of the armory turned to dust. 

30 rounds? Well your gun takes 3 shots to kill anyway, why the fuck do you need 50 rounds?!?"
Omg quit your whining about guns holy shit
The electric ammo is the only issue I see.  Ridiculous that its OHK no matter where hit.
"That's an AK47 or MP7, not a VAL. And it's not OHK anywhere (unless you're in HC)."
I hate that mess. Those little cubes offend me for some reason.
the Dr.Krakow AK one?
"It is beyond needing a nerf, I got knocked up a lobby because of going like 35-1 in zombies and it was disgusting watching good players use it, my Oden was laughable against it, and to think they�re both ARs

Idk who we need to talk to I complain about this gun constantly on here and in lobbies and I write complaints to activision and they won�t budge, but it�s clear to anyone who plays in any sort of competitive fashion that it is broken, it makes all other guns obsolete"
You�re playing Zombies in MW....?.......
"The key is to stun and shoot first. The average VAL user in multiplayer is not very good, the gun just makes them ok."
"you probably havent seen what actually good players van do with the val, its beyond broken"
I'm over here playing Hardcore and people are complaining about 3-4 shots to kill being too fast.
"Honestly it�s pretty unfun in HC too, since it still out classes every other AR."
"If you play cod your not playing ""hardcore"""
Wow so edgy
if you actually think you are the only person that sees it as broken you must be a total moron
"Nah, I play only SnD and as soon as one side whips out the AS VAL, the other does to because there�s no counter to it. Expect you using it. M4 and MP5 have counters. I can counter an M4 with another AR such as oden. MP5, I just keep my distance. Simple. The AS VAL is ridiculous"
"The Val is pretty broken in MP, but also I�ve been noticing the Uzi and amax are OP too"
[deleted]
[deleted]
He�s talking about the Val tho???
Having the same issue! It only happens if you change the attachments on the blueprint. If you leave stock blueprint it doesn�t happen. Still an issue
Atleast I Know I�m not the only one. Is there another way to report this to the developers?
Also mine disconnects even if I don�t edit the blueprint.
If you dont mind me saying the what aug?

Getting same issue soon as i load the golden aug....
"Shoot people from range.. 

Oh, and take advantage of Warzone Rumble!"
"Ok, but I hardly get any long shots with it.."
Warzone rumble doesn�t count. Tried it. This fucking game man. It�s a fucking joke
"Play Plunder (if there isn't Warzone Rumble) go to popular areas (like boneyard or midtown or superstore...) Use deployable cover (i dont know if you can mount CW guns on it or not) but its good for recoil control, use a scope for longshot and all stuff that increase your damage range and get your longshots, since its SMG i dont think you need more than 35m range. Good luck."
Warzone rumble doesn�t count
"Right now there is a respawn rumble mode, do that. 30 meters, lots of targets.

But grinding camos in warzone only was always a nightmare, nothing to do with cold war or mac10 specifically."
Rumble doesn�t count

#FUCKINGCLUTCH
Snipers on that map is so much fun.
All my homies hate it but I like it more than quite a few maps. I also don't play much at all because the game ain't as good but I still play with friends for shit like this.
"No

Guns and charms are only Cold War or warzone. Everything is geared towards Cold War. So nothing would work if you just playing MP"
Seconded. Complete waste of money in this case.
I wish they would just stop fucking shoving Cold war down our fucking throats like I get it you want people to play your fucking game but I'm playing modern warfare for a reason if I wanted to play Cold war I'd fucking buy it
EXACTLY LOL.
Also dude there's only one week left. it's too late to unlock everything and get your money back
Do you unlock things by playing Black Ops and Warzone? I didn�t know this :$
If you�re going to get to tier 100 there�s no reason not to buy it. You get all 1000 of your cod points back plus 300 from free tiers. So you�ll make your cod points back plus some and unlock the items if you ever decide to get black ops cold war plus get the few items that can be used in warzone. If you don�t think you�ll get to tier 100 this season then you should save for next seasons pass.
"Objectively speaking it�s not worth the cost.  The items you get in the battle pass are geared towards Cold War and can be used in Warzone for now.  Unless you plan to use them in Warzone all the time, then it�s not really worth the expense as they cannot be used in multiplayer."
"I think the xp glitch is still present, but it doesn�t really matter the game is still fun to play."
play warzone rumble it's bug free. Rili
"Let�s be honest-
If you based your decision on whether the game is �broken� on this Reddit, you�d never play this game again."
dude there are unironically some pretty bad bugs right now it�s why i asked
Broken AF.
Yea I haven�t played since it converted into an advert for BO but most of the things mentioned were always present in the game camos very often broke or required weird conditions to work on top of the normal. I�m considering picking it up again tho myself seems to be plenty still playing!
#NotYourFault
Headasses would say get out the spawn
And then they talk shit like they are masters at the game for winning a 6v2
"6v2 when they're a clan, are all above average at the game, and all have mics to coordinate. Oh well. Pubstomping will always exist."
"Got the same problem. Basically what my friends tell me is that everybody is just quicker then they are and they're getting stomped into the ground not being able to kill someone or hit a shot.

It's a shame.

They should open a lobby and you should join them in their lobby. With a bit of luck it's not getting too hard for them."
"Yup, that�s the same as me. It�s a super shame because we all used to play cod 24/7. Now nobody hops on because they get destroyed, if u wanna lobby up lemme know haha."
"Yeah you need to join their lobby. I do this with my son, otherwise he gets shit on all the time."
"There's not much you can do other than having more people in your party to put the average skill level in the range you want to play.

It does not matter who hosts, it looks for the average between the party's skill levels"
Squad up
"The problem I�ve found is so many reverse boosting that even when my friends join my lobby or vice versa it has started to got the opposite direction.  

I have about a 1 k/d, which I don�t really care what it is, but when I joined a friend with a .5 he was put in my group fo about 4 matches.  So he joined mine after that and it switched to his, and I intentionally played light in that group.  So it may just be luck of the draw I don�t know, but I played lighter in his grouping, (like no launchers pistols only on shoot the ship) since it was so much easier than normal."
Find some more skillful friends. Problem solved.

How the Announcer feels to lose all his soldiers
wait u made mw? now bring back shipment
I would guess that this may indeed happen since I spent my last CP points two days ago on some crap operator package since I didn't see another season happening.
should have bought the arachnid package.... love that operator skin... dang it!
There's two Operators across three bundles (Soap and Sparks)
If you look in the weapons shop in survival you�ll see three unobtainable weapons
The smg and pistol but what is the third?
Cold War is in the top 20 all time selling games. It�s doing fine. But they really fucked over all the MW players by combining them for Warzone. mW will get no more updates in terms of guns/maps/ operators.
"cold war is great but i wish they just gave it its own warzone, i stopped playing modern warfare because of the grey graphics not letting me see others and aboslutely horrible optimization"
I wish they'd put two operators in the battle pass now that they have both MW and CW content in it. But if this happened some Activision execs would probably become bankrupt and homeless
"Even if it does happen, you'll most likely get a battle pass with 80% of content only available in cold war. Just like how this current season did things. Tbh they might make it even worse. They really want to push cold war and warzone. I wouldn't waste my money on it."
No leakers don�t expect a season 7 but a content drop instead and about your statement about Cold War not doing so well it has become the 20th best selling game in the us
"According to Wikipedia, MW2019 is actually 20th. BOCW isn�t in the top 50..."
MW made 600M in 3 days while it took 6 weeks for CW to make 678M
"oh I wish, I also wouldn't mind adding cold war weapons to normal multiplayer (I mean, when they balance them and fix missing scope glints and correct the attachments' descriptions. If they already made them available in warzone, why not?) I have this weird fetish with russian weapons and the fact that somewhere in the files makarov is hiding and I can't use it in multiplayer drives me crazy"
"There won't be a battlepass for MW, but rather bundles you can purchase. Sucks I know, but it is what it is. Cold War will run its course until CoD2021 drops. Will be interesting to see what'll happen do MW then."
Happening to me too and unfortunately there�s no fix to this yet. Doubt there will be any time soon.
It�s happening to me over and over and over. Xbox One X.
Gonna be honest... I think Activision wants to end the game cause of dumb ass Cold War
This is happening to me as well. The game is literally unplayable for me right now
No way hahahahahahaha
"No, it�s a bug,"
Bug. Don't waste your time.
"If you�re copying and pasting, see if seeing the password while typing is an option. Whenever I copy and paste the password on mobile, it adds a space at the end.  So if you make the password visible, you can see if it�s doing that. However sometimes mobile just doesn�t work and I have to log in on my laptop. If it�s not working on a desktop or laptop, you may have to reset it again"
Ok thanks bro! I�ll try it right now
"Alright I went to desktop and I reset everything, but when I log out and log back in it�s invalid?"
Btw I�m still able to play while all of this is happening
Mine is doing the same thing and it�s saying they�re active... meaning we should be able to progress.
"Yeah but if you see in the earlier replies, someone said that the bug is that we can see the challenges. The challenges for the skin is supposed to be for the Season 1 battle pass Mara skin, meaning that if you haven�t bought the battle pass, you�re not supposed to see it.

But honestly, I�m still waiting for the day they would release the Mara vault pack :�)"
"You weren't playing when the challenge was available, you shouldn't even see the challenge. That's the bug: people are able.to see challenges they dont own"
"Yeah that�s what kept me wondering. AFAIK I didn�t have the skin before this. It was the Season 1 basic black Mara skin and I started playing Warzone and MW in Season 2, so basically I was not supposed to have that skin. It was a fake hope then =(

Was really looking forward to unlocking that skin as it was the only Mara skin that I liked. 

Thanks for the help mate!"
"Thanks! that was bothering me as well since Mara is my favorite operator, so, there is no way for us that didn't play season 1 to get the skins?

I assume if they ever get in the in-game store I could buy them but otherwise we are out of luck, which sucks"
Are you using them in the same life?
Yes
Wait theres a perk that let killstreaks count as normal kills ?
Yes. Killchain
Same slot as ghost and restock
"Are you using them in the same life you got them? So you have to get your 5 cruise missile kills, use the cruise missile to get kills, then still be in that same life for them to count.

Also I swear it doesn't stack with Pointman but I might be wrong"
"It actually does stack with pointman, but it's not 100% intuitive. If you are using pointman with no killchain, your killstreaks will give you +25 points per kill. If you are using killchain AND pointman, kills in the same life will give you +125 points; if you die and call in your streaks, they go back to +25 points. 

The fact they give you any points after you die is actually a big deal on maps like Promenade because it means if you get a streak like white phos or gunship, you can suicide and get enough kills in the next life to get a pred, which can lead to another VTOL and then to another white phos or gunship and then loop them infinitely."
"Dad just started playing, he's stuck on lvl 1 and doesn't get any xp for some reason."
They removed XP from MW late in the battle pass to encourage purchase of Cold War.
"nooooo way, this must be some scummy stuff, but well, atleast we can use warzone to level up stuff. Although warzone i think is slower"
Naaa probably just had a lower KD than you seeing that your shots towards the end stopped registering
Is mini royale still a thing?
Yes it�s deff that
This is how I feel most games
"Do you have the main game?  If you load into customs and try out diff pistols, you'll notice that the trajectory of your bullets won't match your iron sights the faster you shoot. At full auto it shoots below so in this clip at most you're getting stomach shots with lower dmg.  Along with him spam jumping it's just going below him. It's a frequent theme with how IW chose to add realism or balance to weapons by adding more visual desync to actual reticle."
wrong sub post on r/codwarzone
"So you blow up? That could be the Rytec AMR, sniper, explosive rounds. Or the crossbow with explosive bolts."
Killcam would show that tho. This sounds more like a bugfest on his end tbh.
Could be you're getting killed by an exploding car or like the random propane tanks around certain maps? I know when I have died to that it shows the car but its like underneath the map kinda.
The killcam shows no gun? No player? Nothing?
Usually just a weird glitch shot from inside my player model or terrain. There's no other players POV of the shot. All I see is the calling card/player name & weapon info.
Sped ops is Sledgehammers attempt at Spec ops

"it works fine for all lot of people, idk"
"I've had the same issue. It also hasn't been tracking any of the operator challenges for a week or two, now."
I just went and tried it on my brothers ps4 exact same setup two controllers this time it doesn't even start a game it crashes on the first maps loading screen to the PlayStation menu and gives some weird error seems to be exactly the same on both consoles I'm not holding out much hope tbh I shelled out for bops cold War and that multiplayer after the first game every one turns to ghosts except for their guns like textures aren't loading in at least zombies only crashes 1/15 or so
Are you playing split screen? Because there's a big issue with split screen crashing that hasn't been fixed in forever. Search split screen on this sub and you'll see for yourself.
Yeah split screen rather annoying issue and doesn't look great for Activision if it's a known issue and they still havent done a single thing about it
"Yeah, one of the few guys I enjoyed getting gold

Edit 1: Gold* lmao

Edit 2: Oh fuck me"
"yeha, that things has a god tier attachment with the snatch grip and also it has very fast ads no matter what u pu ton"
such an underrated weapon.
r/codwarzone
"Best gun in the game, WZ especially"
I think black people should have rights
You�re very progressive
"Something similar happened to me. What I had to do was take out the disc, restart my Xbox, then put the disc back in and it worked for me"
Does this to me all the time - not just modern warfare games in general. Give it a few days / hours and it will fix itself
"try tot go into the store and download everything you can for it, I think thats what I did for ps4."
"this happens to be all the time, taking the disc out and restarting the Xbox usually works and if it doesn't it helps if you just let the game boot up after you put the disc in other than selecting it"
No.
no
only warzone is merged
along with the levels or not?
"Gun game is a great way to help level up weapons in MW.   It won't unlock any new weapons that require challenges to be completed, but progress you make on locked guns via gun game will be stored and applied upon unlocking."
Who asked you?
"Nope. Not even the stickers, charms, and etc from CW can be used in MW.

Warzone is the only place that has the weapons from both games. Balancing CW guns for MW multiplayer would be a nightmare."
Not many people run the m13 and its fun to use. Also the mk2 carabine
"I have to agree, the Carbine can lay thunder on people of you get good with it."
M13 is pretty fun to use even for a relatively lower skill player like me.
Road to gold or Damascus? Cus if you want gold go for whatever gun u want in gold
Damascus sounds nice but that'll take me forever. At this point it'll be gold and if I make enough progress I'll consider trying for damascus.
oden is fun when you get the hang of it. aug is a good gun but rarely used
I've been doing work with my Aug but haven't picked it up in the last few weeks. Did a lot of surprising things with the AN-94 but the firerate pushed me away.
M13
"Yeah just a few weeks ago my friend and i made a mk2 class with thermal hybrid scope, smoke nades, throwing knives and akimbo deasert eagles and it was so fun"
Thermal scope.. lmao
"If you're a Masochist, I say go with the crossbow. Personally, it's my favorite weapon to use. Yes I get massacred at times, but killing people with dragon's breath shotguns, and MP5s never gets old.


I just wish thermite arrows didn't bounce off shields. I think that is what killed it for a lot of people. Still, the journey has been fun."
I use molotovs when there's a lot of riot shields.
"p90 and 5.45 ak. 


both are underrated and super fun."
"I started really playing around with different AK47 builds yesterday, it's such a good gun. For the AK I like to go full on AKS-74u. Short barrel, Merc, 5.45 ammo, skeleton stock, then 5mw laser for sprint to fire time and hip fire. It absolutely shreds and you can always mount/tap to hit long range targets."
"The Aug is so underrated but it's really good 

30 round 5.56 mags, 407 extended barrel, compensator, tac laser, sleight of hand. It's good."
"That's essentially what I run with the AUG, a tweaked version of the Al Rukh, but the AUG's sights make me want to vomit so I put a red dot or 2� on it.

Edit: Spelling"
"i wouldn't use the 407 extended ever. Either go no barrel or go 622 long barrel, it has just about the same ADS penalty.

Compensator, 30R 5.56, Stippled Grip Tape, Forge Tac CQB Stock, Sleight of Hand"
"SCAR: Long Barrel, Operator Grip, Stippled, Holosight, Sleight of Hand. Not the best SCAR loadout, but it's got good range, low recoil and the SoH reload is pretty much instant. I like it when I'm not sweating or fighting longer range.

AK: Usually something I throw together for a specific look. ""Alpha"" AKs, RPKs, etc. Works well.

Uzi: 41. AE, Carbine Pro Barrel, Stippled, SoH, your choice. 41AE is a must have on the Uzi, otherwise it's underperforming. Really good with .41 AE.

I can also REALLY recommend the PKM. Snatch Grip is a must, set it up for ADS speed with a holosight on top and you're golden. I usually leave the barrel alone to keep some range and use a tac laser, but that's up to you."
"On the Scar i used Tactical Suppressor, 30 Round Mag, Stippled Grip Tape, Collapsible Stock, Fully Loaded

recoil isn't bad on the gun, it just looks bad. Having the suppressor removes the muzzle flash, which makes tracking people mid-gunfight a bit easier."
R90 with slugs is really fun.
I�ve played like 10hours because I love the game and got no lvls
I would like to second this.
"I wish they�d go back and polish up Mara (retroactively �fixing� her face so all outfits have the same face model) and rerelease her old stuff. I missed out during season one so I am using her, as you say, �anime� outfit (Notice Meow) because when doing night time maps it�s the only outfit I have with a helmet that the night vision goggles can attach to so they aren�t just floating in mid air. Quite bummed I couldn�t get her classic outfit w/helmet. Now that bug is appearing like I have access to those old missions and it�s rubbing salt in the wounds. xD"
Hey man whatever gets your pickle stiff.
"dude

mil-sim skins

they're gone

if you've missed previous seasons, as I have, you're left behind as to good skins for operators. i just want a realistic US operator, but the closest you can get at this rate is one of the operator skins that looks silly at best. I strongly agree with your case"
I think it�s fine since it�s call of duty has always been an arcade shooter and it should be treated as one. I really hate the slow pace call of duty has taken and I honestly wish things were futuristic
Do you also not getting +100 kill points when you kill someone? Dont know if this is only me.
"Yea i only get a ""eliminated"""
its a known glitch
Dude literally everyone and their mom posts about this we know
No reason to be rude.
They removed XP from MW to encourage purchase of Cold War.
"It�s funny, they tied in the leveling progression of Cold War into MW to entice players to buy the game, yet I can�t even earn the XP necessary to level up."
"It�s become almost unplayable. Between 5-10 crashes per session. PS4 Pro here, not a PC. For us it�s usually when a level is loading. We�re going on two weeks of the game playing worse than cyberpunk in the early days."
I don't understand what's happening over there. When will be able to have a more stable version of the game?
"Have you found anything that helps? Also PS4Pro, crashes everytime when loading into a match"
"the game is absolutely horribly optimized, on my 2012 mid range pc it ran better than on my i7 1080ti now, its a 50gb game with 220gb patchwork of shitty textures and coding. stop supporting activision until they fix their games"
I never knew abt this
"Oh, well now you know! It�s the livestock Easter egg. I suggest having a friend, otherwise it�s harder to time the whole thing right."
"There's an Easter egg for Aisle 9, Trench, Station and Livestock. Also Cheshire Park"
WHAT IN THE KENTUCKY FRIED FUCK IS THIS?!
Yeah I had to unplug the headset when it started lmao
Do you get anything for doing it?
Nope just an uneasy feeling while watching lol but this was my favorite one to do anyway
I totally forgot this is a thing. I did every onw appart from this one. Youve inspired me to do it lol. Cheers
Haha have fun! Doing it with a friend makes it go by faster. I was alone though so it took me a few tries.
what kind of satanic shit is this
Yeah it def was weird lmao
I never knew about this one
"Haha there�s several MP Easter eggs. Cheshire park, station, trench, cargo, aisle 9, livestock (this one), and probably a couple more that I can�t think of from the top of my head"
I had no idea this was a thing lol have to try it for myself
I�d like to join that religion
wht the HELL
Yeah I had to unplug my headset when it started happening lmao
a certified bruh moment
I wonder if the guy who threw it even knew what happened
"Nice. I love seeing an ace/clutch. I choked my second 1v6 the other day on the last guy, however I have managed to get a 1v6 anyway and put it on YouTube. Keep up the clutching and acing!"
"It did and it didn't, some rounds i still don't get XP other rounds i do. But its better then no rounds giving XP."
It�s moved over to warzone now to me game I�ll get xp next game I want what a fn joke
I've been playing for 2 hours now and haven't gained 1xp. Not sure why I re-installed this tbh
Are you guys also not getting Xp from each kill in game??
Its been a problem for more than a week now. That and no hitbox.
I get XP after each game but most I�ll ever get is 300-1000xp. I have a feeling that multiplayer has XP lowered because everything is synced with Cold War and they don�t want you grinding your Cold War levels in modern warfare. Just my theory on why it�s not getting fixed but warzone xp seems to be normal
I'm pretty sure weapon xp is fixed
I mean maybe for you but it seems like not everyone is getting their xp. Which is even weirder!
I�ve had it back since last Wednesday (6 days ago)
"Will only reinstall when shoot the ship is back, BF1 is far better still lol"
BF1 is really dead tho
Im new how is your pistol bullets red like that?
"There�s a blueprint M19 with red tracer rounds, I just chose that, stripped it down in gunsmith and used my own attachment setup"
"Hit up activision support on Twitter, at least they are more responsive there"
Will do. Thanks!
"I�m having the same issue rn, can�t unlink my account because after I click the button a extra screen pop up but it�s just blank"
"It always freezing for a few second when ""looking for 7 more player"" for me"
"Good job dude, if you plan on going for Damascus, rocket launchers are a bitch"
"Nice, keep working towards those challenges! Happy cake day!"
Thank you!
"For some context I�m a day one player but I only played casually, and I never focused on challenges until a few months ago, I�m like 75% complete for the AK-47 too"
"Keep at it and don�t give up.  Take breaks from the grind and remember to have fun in the process.

Congratulations on your first gold.  It�s a great feeling."
Take it from me who�s doing Damascus all I have left is launchers... DO LAUNCHERS FIRST
It can hide you in dark corners in certain maps and others (someone posted a photo of the rook skin on shipment ) it acts as a camouflage
Ooooooooh so pay to win? Also is this the same with velikan megalith skin?
"I find it harder to see, to the point where I nearly always lose to them"
"Because just like bunny hopping a few streamers said it was great.  It�s supposed to help blend in the shadows, but that�s easily overcome by turning up the brightness a touch.  

However  because many think it gives an advantage they use it as a pay to win meta.  For people like me, they�re just another target enemy."
I don�t find it too hard to see honestly but yeah IW should make the skin a bit more noticeable it�s like Fortnite withy he superhero skin people kept doing the edgy one with all black and sometimes red eyes
"Its entierlely black and due to a glitch in the game�s lighting on Azhir cave, piccadily,  hideout, and oil rig, its invisible on certain spots"
No wonder it�s only campers who use it
"Scar. Hits really hard with really low recoil but a small mag size. Attachments: longest barrel, commando, tac laser, stippled, sleight of hand"
"Yea I use the scar too, hits like a train."
"Striker.

Gets a bad rep but its actually a decent weapon when you don't compare it to the meta."
"I play on PC and with the 2 round burst mags it can be pretty nasty, one of my favorite guns I leveled up for plat SMGs"
Quickscope 725 with slugs and sniper scope or akimbo deagles
"725 with the slugs is pretty brutal lol, did not have fun doing the long shots with that for gold"
"Honestly, and this might be a long shot, might even set you up for failure lmfao but I had one 13 kill warzone with a completely decked out AK. Definitely not meta but packed a punch if you can handle it, best at mid range and close. Hard at long range."
holger setup like a g36k
How is that now ?
"an94 is my favorite, its hard to use but very satisfying to master. my setup is: longest barrel, commando foregrip (or the muzzle brake for the aesthetics), 60 rnd mag, stippled grip and a sight of your preference"
"EBR, was always was a fan of it no matter which game it�s available.

It�s pretty satisfying getting headshot after headshot with it."
"Yeah that�s always been one of my favorites, it�s just a better handling dragunov, for some reason I can�t stand it in this game though. It is amazing though when you find a group of 2 or 3 and manage to clip each one with head shots it�s not often, but man when it happens..."
"The EBR14 is slept on wayyy too much. It's my favorite weapon, and it's commonly misunderstood. It's a gun that rewards accuracy, and deliberate shot placement. If you spam it (like everyone immediately does with semi-autos) it loses all it's effectiveness.  


But its got good bullet velocity, and can OHK to the head at any range, so its great at counter sniping and angle holding."
"25 round drum mag, extended barrel and spam the fuck out of it."
Hardcore
"You are. It was over with the first shot and then the shot on Verdansk was basically the nail in the coffin.

People posting cheating and selling it as legit is getting old for a while now."
"hahaha ty for the compliment, but i am not cheating:D i play with standard ps4 controller on the ps4:))"
you use controller ?
yes:)
Damn you good
ty man:) maybe you can check out my yt channel?:) i have many videos like this:D Link is in the comment section:)
What sensitivity is that damn
"sensitivity: 20/20

I have no idea what any of this means. But bravo to those who do. I�ma carry on being old now.
Futives is a SnD YouTube/streamer that this sub worships.

I love both
ayo that�s me
Can I marry u
I love you futives
This and constant weapon camo celebration posts are why this sub is trash lol
LOL it�s been over a year since the game came out and people still post that shit. like dude we all know what damascus looks like lol
What's the diff?
"I always mute, chat is so fucking annoying"

OK bye
You go to settings and forget where but there will be an option that asks input type change it to mouse and keyboard
[deleted]
"You need to have both M/KB connected, and not be looking for a match. Go to settings-general, and select M/KB as your input. Put the controller down (or turn it off if you want to), and proceed to use M/KB while navigating the menu. Should work."
I used the War Pig that came with Wyatt for like the first 6 months of MW but ghost and nikto ended up being my favorite
Mara by far
Ghost/Grinch (the Jason skin)
I also love both of the those skins! The Jason Grinch skin is underrated
I really like the milsim skins from season 3 especially the para rescue skin
D Day
Lerch
"I gotta say Alex, with any of his tier 100 skins"
I also love Alex as well
Iskra but Velikan is a close second cause of the leather face skin

"Yeah I have the spy games for domino, love that skin"
"Otter, his �evanesce� skin is pretty cool"
Partial to Alice with her Surreptitious skin..
Try an actual computer if you can I think the mobile site is buggy.
"If you login through your platform account it won't work, you gotta login via your Activision account using the email you registered with."
Have you unlinked your account before? Because you can only do it once every 12 months.
"Who thought once per year was a good idea? 

I ask because I got my account hacked and now I can't switch my Battle.net account back to my main account after recovery because both the hackers Battle.net account and were recently unlinked by the hacker, so even though I have both accounts now, I can't actually recover my account until 2022 because I can't unlink either of them.

This is after I submitted an Account Recovery form to recover my account, to be denied because recovering my account has nothing to do with the purpose of the Account Recovery Form.

I've tried contacting a live chat agent, only for it to also do absolutely nothing."
"The mobile website is probably just bad. Use a computer. Or a better browser, like downloading chrome on your phone"
Same thing with me. I've tried three different laptops and my desktop. I an unable to unlink my account. I have cod on ps4 but I also bought it on pc so I am trying to log out of pc so i can make a new ps4 cod account. This sucks.
"Same, Ive tried with Blizzard, PSN and activision but nothing seems to work"
"If you're afraid something can be done with your IP address then get yourself a VPN subscription. 

Also, this game isn't P2P so how would they get your IP? Probably they're just typing x.y.z.t where x,y,z and t are 4 random numbers between 0 and 255, maybe some common values for x like 168 or 192 ahah"
"I'm not necessarily afraid of something being done with my IP it's just annoying how constantly it's happening now lol, I know some people just use random looking IP' to convince someone that they know but some of them actually say what town I'm in (at least my IP' town cause they always say the town next to my one)"
"They got my ip, said the town I was in and everything. But im not scared of some snd bums"
I stopped playing in December for my mental sanity.
Lol same after raging at the game due to the stupid matchmaking I quit. There are so many games that are way better
Pretty sure you should take this to r/Warzone
This energy is why I just stay off my Xbox now lol
"Facts. Once BF6 comes out, I'm not touching MW for a long ass time."
"""We're gonna have some fun"" ...  


No, I think we won't"
I've been playing every match with the names still showing from 12 matches ago. The bug wont update with the new players names. PS5(ps4 version)
"Just quit taking the game seriously, it's legit that simple. I just go around trolling people with stuns and flashes now and it's hilarious because I don't even care if I die"
Betcha it doesn't happen to ColdWar accounts
Why should they? People keep playing it even with how it is
Infinity ward: Why would we? We made you a great game ^that's ^worse ^in ^every ^aspect THAT YOU ALSO CAN PURCHASE
Why should they? The same reason a road is fixed when you run through it with a pothole and damage your car. The same reason landlord's fix apartments before you rent them. The same reason plumbers fix pipes and leaking when they're broken. ITS. BROKEN.

idk man I just had a 47-4 earlier it was pretty fun
I still be having good fun games like this as well
Not till they fix the bs they�ve created
I'd say yes. IF THEY WOULD FIX THE DAMN WEAPON XP!
"When you are play for the first time

Activision: Hey lets do a survey to this player

Me: Nah!"
theyre working on it
Is this a bug everybody has right now?
"Who knows when it�ll be fixed tbh, we haven�t heard anything from them in so long I don�t hold my breath anymore."
With only 10 more days of the current season it�s more then likely it will be fixed when the next season rolls out.
"It�s weird today was the first day I have been able to level up weapons in a few weeks. It was working in the gun game tournaments and I�ve put a few levels on the ax50, famas, deagle, striker"
"This looks so funny, there should be a third person game mode in game, looks great"
Yeah and aside from the missing cross hair it was very functional. The Metal Gear Solid style of shoulder zoom made me think it was an intentional feature that they were planning to add
"My guns do level up but it doesn�t explicitly tell me. If I want to see the difference in XP I have to check my load out. If my gun levels up mid game though, it does say, like �JAK 12 level up�


HOWEVER, a lot of people still are not getting any XP whatsoever, and others have it perfectly fixed, it tells XP during game and levels up everything. It�s a lottery at this point."
Ahh. Last time I looked I couldn�t level my ISO. Guess I�ll go check
"Raven: we fixed it

Narrator: they did not"
Fun fact: Blueprints with special ironsights almost always only change the rear sights and barrels only ever change the front sights
Wow I never considered that but it makes perfect sense
Ebr has blueprints that change them
ram-7 red crow
Most barrels change sights a bit as the front sight is often different
"Just to add some:

AUG has 2 sets. Regular (also available in smaller on Gremlin) and modifed sights like Slipper Clutch or Dame Fortuna

Bizon Chuckwalla has different sights

Striker has a different set on Halcyon Days or Dream Dasher

If we go by barrel:

680 30"" Sport

AK47 short barrel

&#x200B;

Those are the ones i can think of rn that you haven't mentioned"
M91
Smallest ak barrel changes iron sights. Not sure if you would consider this a change but putting on either the RPK or Romanian barrel will make the iron sights smaller/farther away
"short ak barrel doesn't change the sights themselves, only the sight picture (how the sights look to the shooter)"
"So many ppl that play without headsets dont realise how loud everything they do is.

Picking up ammo. Yes

Crouch walking on metal? Hella loud

Swapping/Reloading weapon

Standing to crouching and vice versa

Using dead silence but run through foliage? Loud"
Sound hacks
First tell us what headset you use and then we can explain how much of a difference it makes to have good headphones. I was using ps4 golds before I got a arctis pro wired headset. Believe me man you don't know until you know. Sound hoaring with a good EQ in this game is just unfair.
Sound settings?
Effects 100 with overall around 40. Then I mess with pc overall volume
How do people get these s&d clips where opponents just waltz in like nobody�s there?  Like how on earth did the staircase guy not have a bead on you.
Idk man they collapsed on me pretty quick
Well color me impressed
"Bet that guy thought he was in the clear as well, nicely done."

"it's bug, get kills with Renetti as ususal and you get that Akimbo."
Not a pro but definitely could be the ram. Im typically sucking up 12 gb�s when playing modern warfare.
"alr, i'll try adding some more rams. thanks for the answer"
"8gb is very low for modern games, i have 32 and i can easily go 18+ with modern warfare. the game will take as much as it can get, and 8gb needs to run the game and windows 10...which itself is a memory hog"
"alr, thanks for the info. i never really bothered to check how many ram i had"
Its the anti aliasing maybe .... it is very grapicscard heavy.... put it on the lowest or off
"i don't think so, a 1060 should be able to get away with it easily. i'll try it though, thanks"
Maybe hacker? Or he have superior reflexes

Prob walling. you on pc or have crossplay on?"
Ismt crossplay enabled the only way you can play WZ?
I'm on console with crossplay
If you're on ps4 you can disable it
In my region I won't be able to find games if I disable it unfortunately

"There is a video, you need to click on it to turn it on."
"Like cmon, I love this game but majority of the maps seem huge"
"It does that on ps4 as well, I just thought it was loose sticks, but you are right I tried it in other games, it's just cod. I even tried it in ghosts (don't kill me comments) and it doesn't do that. My guess is that it is another example of the many laggy things in MW right now."
"I�m getting it on ps4, not sure what�s causing it but I find myself slapping my controller after an hours or so of Warfare"
This is a controller (hardware) issue unrelated to COD.
"Works fine on my XSX. Has since I got it. Im not sure about the crashes but I do have a few questions. 

1) are you on disk or digital?
2) are you using wired or wifi? (Wired is preferable)
3) is your ping below 100 when you press start during multiplayer?

For me I'm using a wired connection with an open NAT type. My copy of the game is digital only. And my ping is low. If this is the same for you and its still happening, you might want to call your ISP or Microsoft for assistance."
"Thanks for the reply! I believe I have the ideal setup and it still seems to not work well.

I have a wired Gbps network connection, digital copy of the game and seemingly low ping. Maybe a reinstall will help..."
" 

Here, but on PC.

With the last update my performance was destroyed, and now I�ve 63fps (or less).  
It�s the same to set lower sets or higher resolution.  
Even setting as ""unlimitted"" the frame limiter and setting the limit at 300 fps on AMD control panel.

Adding to that, playing tonight with friends on PM, we had constant packet burst and extrapolation\* issues.

"Yeah it so strange... good luck with troubleshooting, hope you can can solve it!"
Yeah it�s terrible on PC right now too. The game was perfectly fine a couple days ago but ever since the last update it�s laggy and horrible.
"I had some crashes after the 1.31 update (the one that broke stuff) but since the newest patch I haven't crashed at all. Performance wise has been fine 

Might be a problem with the install or something?"
Crashes constantly on my XSX. Wired internet. All matches are well below 100 ping. I�m able to play 1-2 matches split screen and then it crashes. Digital edition. Open NAT. Cleared Blu-ray and MAC address. Deleted save content on device as well as 1 GB reserve. Over and over again I�ve tried these steps. Newest update is the worst in a while.

or they's trolling.....
Do you have an Xbox or a PS4? If you have an Xbox my gt is sakchase bam we can run when I get off work. I need friends for cod anyway.

Weird Question: How did you get the M4 with the carryhandle
It was a reward for hitting max rank in season 0
"I got one in a tournament but those days are long gone. It's probably not as effective as stock, but I love the aesthetic."
The one he is using is acquired by pre ordering cold war
Theres some bundles with that but imo it looks terrible
I got death threats for doing this. So....I kept doing it to pissed them off more.
I would be so pissed
A full hit stun last like 5-6 seconds. With restock and a a full team you could probably stun one person forever.
I had this class but with smoke grenades before lol
"Wait dumb question: 

can you use cold war blueprints (aka this season's blueprints) in modern warfare as well??? I'm a returning player so things are really different now

If not, then what blueprint is OP using?"
In warzone they're mixed but not multiplayer.
"No you can�t. 

For the M4, it�s the �Old faithful� that you get when u pre order CW. The AMAX is just a regular AMAX"

Me and my friend did it yesterday too after I got kicked from the finals with a random because the game is developed like poo lmao

The Famas Valorise is already in the game.......the Code Breaker
not everyone played back then/got 155 (I did tho and I love the look of it)

Nice one. Congrats. Got mine yesterday. Jumped on and managed it first try after playing cold war for months. Was a good refeshing change
"Lloyd Bridges in Airplane ""Well I picked a bad day to stop sniffing Glue!""

This has been the worst update run in the game since launch.  XP is bugged, challenges are bugged. lobbies are like playing Faze wannabe's and lagging is off and on bad.  Raven is slooowly fixing shit, probably hoping you bounce to WZ and buy CW.  It will get better but only as they fix all the shit they broke.  

With all that us MW 2019 fans are STILL playing!"
"Yeah they kind of abandoned mw, they even removed tier skips from mw store packs. Maybe the last content update will bring Soap, Sparks, the sykov the cx-9 and the raal as the last weapons, they are already finished and implemented into survival."
I very much doubt we will see those items at this point. Looks much more like it was planned content that then got scrapped instead of unreleased content.
I think theres info for new guns atleast in cw and warzone so wz isint dead
Whoopde doo.
"The game isn�t dead at all, but support of it has ended pretty much, they should add Shoot the Rusty Ship permanently but you know they won�t, I uninstalled last night and am back playing BF1 again, sooooo much better"
+1
same is happening to me
"yea thats strafe jumping, it has been in cod since the first one. i guess people just forgot about the technique and the term for it"
"some quake player call it circle jumping, all the old cods used a modified quake 3 engine which is why it is in the game. The MW2019 devs did a pretty good job of naking it useless lol."
"If it has taken this long to learn about strafing in cod then, Where the fuck have you been lmao."
I am learning you can do this in COD at all today. Been playing since MW3. What buttons or sticks do you use to get the extra distance? Jump obviously but what's after that? A swinging or looping motion with left stick?
Make strafe jumps and bounces great again
"i miss bouncing in cod4, great trickshot potential"
It was also a thing in Call of Duty 2 in 2005
If you pause at 0:00 and look at the car it has no business looking that realistic.
"You can combine the strafe jump (not circle jump) from an elevated surface with a bunnyhop to get potential [bounces](https://streamable.com/7msszw)

"People call it damage boosts because u have to take damage to make the boost

"I am coming from Cod2, where it is a big thing and don�t know that is possible in MW/Warzone"
unfortunately the acceleration gained from circlejumping is neglible and most viable jumps can be done with sprint. Having that extra air control can be fun sometimes tho.
[deleted]
 Jgod did a video on C4 and Thermites �going further on pc� in reality they go the same exact distance as you or I on console. It looks like they go further becuase PC players can change their FOV and it only LOOKS like they can throw things further.
Yeah start adding that concept to your b-hops. It will change your life OP.
"Thx 4 the tip, u get so much momentum"
Learned how to strafe jump back on die rise on bo2 but thanks for the tip I already knew
This has been a thing in just about every single call of duty game ever. Nice tutorial though.
I've been playing this game for too long...
Back in my day we called this strafe jumping
Old cods used the quake engine and quake players call it circlejumping
I used this ever since quake 2.
"nice clip, but those deagle are so bad. long barrels reduce hipfire accuracy a lot, making that the worst attachment for akimbo and you are not using extended mags"
Looking good is way more important than using optimal gun set ups
Or 5mw laser
"I find that so bizarre. �More barrel for more dwell time? Meh. Less accuracy.�
Big dumb."
Okay what is the Akimbo firing technique if you use a mouse?  I seem to suk at it but got pretty good using single pistols.  Share?
I�m interested in this too I�m a pretty solid PC player but I cannot function with AKIMBO so I usually just use a single deagle
That was intense.
You should try the ren
Dual Renettis are bae
Lol
Anyone wanna play ?
Do those sticks make people run faster?
probably idk. im not a noob who uses those. i use actual lethal weapons

How is using a gun cheating?
Read the comments
If you put any other well known quickscoping weapon against it the carbine has a waay faster fire rate
"TIL people still care about quickscoping 

IMO as long as it has a sniper scope it's fine. Iron sights quickscopes are for losers"
Say less haha
"Also on series x and its giving me connection failed.

My copy of cold war doesn't work at the moment either."
"Not only that,  on multiple maps theres areas you can clip out of. Can shoot, but can't be shot."
Ground war has been feeling more sweaty as well for me. I thought it was because of the issues with warzone so all the sweats in warzone decided to go back to MW
I have a really good hunch that they might tone down the sbmm this year in anticipation of BF6 releasing. BF is the only competition this year and Activision knows how much people hate sbmm so who knows.
"port, palace, boneyard...possibly quarry are the only maps you want to play in ground war. rest are trash"
I'm not a big fan either. I find it hard to get anywhere in that mode
"I don't think they brought in SBMM, I think people play it because there's no SBMM, my experience on GW has been poor as of late. It's turned into a spawn campfest where people grind kill streaks or they sit on a roof, sniping and get 5 kills a match. My team will never push out of spawn if we have 1 flag.

I just back out if I get Riverside or Promenade"
"Not everyone enjoys anal sex. People enjoy different things, this mode may simply not be for you."

they're the only ones i know of"
So you have to pay money to get that sight?
"M4A1 blueprints w/ carry handle iron sights:

**No longer attainable:**

\- ""OG""  <- Reward for achieving max rank during Season 0.

\- ""Old Faithful""  <- Given through pre-ordering BOCW.

\- ""Grail Quest"" <- Season 4 Gunfight Tournament 1st place prize.

**Available in the store:**

\- ""Jumping Spider"" <- Purchased through store bundle.

\- ""Primis"" <- Purchased through store bundle.

\- ""The breakup"" <- Purchased through store bundle.

&#x200B;

**Primis** isn't too bad if you can get past the green smear. **Jumping Spider** has a gold & orange finish that I don't really like. And **The Breakup** is a anime bundle w/pink tracers, but you'll be looking at an anime girl every time you sight in."
Is it that m4 - OG skin if i remember right
"Want a nice tracer M4 with sexy irons?  1776 M4, pairs so cleanly with Damascus camo I use a no-stock build with it."
"Different blueprints have different irons 

Do you mean the ghost ring sights?"
"I have 2 with those. the og and the faithful.  

edit:3\* also the holy grail has it."
M16 Grenadier Barrel?
"nah, blue prints."
[deleted]
Gee thanks but I�m not brain dead
yes u can
Thank you!
"I mean, no, you can't. If the sight was all they wanted to change, sure, it would probably be basically the same. But if they want it to keep that ""skin"" regardless of attachments, no, the new parts will have the default weapon skil/whatever other blueprint part you decide to make it look like if you have another blueprint with that part."
Yeah little things like a scope or something don�t change the look but like changing a mag or grip does and can take away from the blueprint luckily I only bought two bundles and they had the attachments I wanted haha but you should be good changing the sight
Thank you!
"Hey.  What ive noticed is when you have a blueprint with attachments on it already they are adapted the the guns blueprint look.   When you change the attachments so something that didn't come equipped on the gun, you loose that blueprint style.    E.g the ammo could be 50 end mags and they have the blueprint style but if you change to 60rnd you loose the style for that specific blueprint.    Hope it helped !"
"I agree and disagree, the devs kinda just ignore the game, we have had a weapon not leveling up glitch for over a week and the anti cheat took like 2 years. The game is good but it had a lot of problems that need fixing. Its like flex tape, fixes everything else hut not itself, unless you use more flex tape. That analogy doesn't work does it?"
"Try out hardcore cyber attack, its a lot of fun with friends because you can revive each other"
"Search is genuinely the best it's ever been this time around. To me the mode was always kinda bad in other CODs, but it's seriously good in this one. 

Cyber attack is great too, as is gunfight. Though if I'm being honest I'd say Hardpoint is also at its best here."
it's cod not cs go.
i couldn't have said it better
What?
"Crouching/being prone in a dark corner should boost your blast and tactical equipment resistance, enhance your hearing (due to sensoral adaptation, purely logical) and make you aim perfectly."
Love your shit post pure a1 shit post not even trolling fuck the camping rats
Am I only one who just can't hold w to go straight forward? The game just feel so boring when you're not using movement. It's only my opinion tho.
"thats what cod is all about, if you reduce the movement it would ruin the game for most people. besides, MW is among one of the slowest cods already, so why make it slower?"
You have a tactical sprint option that wasn�t in previous cods wtf are you talking about!? Lmao MW is one of the fastest mobilities for ALL cod games you donut.
I agree and also... Getting shot should completely throw your aim out of whack!!
"Yea for a game tbat prides itself on realism i cant stand the bunny hopping in particular(really stands.out among the sweaty movemenys to me for some reason), just looks so friggin stupid and ruins immersion, if i wanted.goofy cartoonish shit like that id play fortnite, otherwise i love the game"
I don't know it pissed me off when I see a player looking like they are on crack.
Oh yea cos there's not enough camping in this game as it is.
Now they want people too stand still while shooting.
Yes
"Hate to admit it but yeah being competitive in cod has always come down to sweaty movement. Even back in 2005, 13 year old me playing CoD2 was jump shooting, drop shooting, bunny hopping.

I think a lot of us now (me included) are annoyed by advanced movement because we are older and don't care for the bs any more. Its too much work and takes me out of the more grounded MW experience.

For the record, I effing hate sliding because its optimal to slide around every corner already aiming at the most acute angle corner. Its more work than I want to do and feels stupid if I don't even know someone is there"
Sorry not everyone likes to crouch walk everywhere they go
That might be an issue with your console/pc taking a long time to load the game. My old Xbox One used to always join me in games 20 seconds late.
Yea it�ll happen in snd too. Just surprised both me n my friend had a late spawn
"Don't say sorry bro, was a sick shot.
Fuck those guys who moan about having to watch extra 10 seconds.

"yep, common bug after patch 1.31, it�s better now compared to last week when the patch just dropped but my reticle still takes it�s time to load when I just spawned in to a brand new match sometimes."
"Huh yeah


I thought this was just for me in plunder cause I�ve had my m16 bug out and it�s empty for a few seconds 


I�ve found it happens when I switch weapons for a few minutes like from a sniper to a rifle but it doesn�t affect snipers for me at least 


It�s been like these for at least 1 week but I shrugged it off as just a joke"
Yep. If you constantly start and stop sprinting you can see it every 5th sprint or so.
Getting this error today randomly tried disc repair and game repair not fixed
"Yep, this keeps happening to me, not often, but it's now started to happen!"
"Happens to me as well, Ive gone through everything to try to fix it and no luck. Verified game integrity, reinstalled, made sure nothing else is running, updated drivers, its not a lack of pc resources, I have a high end pc with 16gb ram and 1080ti... I cant seem to fix it."
"Getting similar but slightly different (0x0000000144a2d1bb 8619761 0xc0000005), I'll let you know if I find a solution. When does it crash for you? For me it's just as the operator appears on the menu screen (or within a few seconds after)."

Yeah same here. Mara�s tier 100 skin from season 1 is also in my challenges which also aren�t working.
It seems that they are adding bundles with the base skins for these - and then the operator missions may track (can�t confirm this yet because I am waiting for a ghost bundle or so before I buy any other bundle)
If it helps there all listed as �operator missions� and no season.

No need to be a dick about it geez
Follow the gram @ MJDPlaysGames for more dope clips!
Im having the same with the error Code CERES
"So I called Microsoft. Apparently this has been an issue for quite a few people and they know about it. I had the same issue. When loading cold war the splash screen would come on then it would go to a black screen then kick me out.  It was also affecting warzone as well.  Booted up to the infinity ward screen, then freeze and kick me back out.  Apex legends was freezing at the character selection screen.  I Was told that I need to delete Cold War until a fix comes out.  They estimated 48 hours.  I spoke to them today.  So I am thinking by Tuesday. Fingers crossed. When I deleted it, my games all booted normally. Sucks to have to delete a game that is close to 100 gigs, but at least I can load other games until the fix comes out. Hope this helps"
"I recommend using this with no optic, it's so much quicker."
"They renamed it to Call of Duty Warzone, so see if that is in your library. It�s no longer actually named modern warfare which can be super confusing when trying to find it."
Thanks. Got it. 200GB! Whew.
You have to open it through Warzone.
Thanks.
Spec ops.
"yep, basically everyone is still getting no xp after patch 1.31, one way around it, for me at least, is to play the co-op operations, it�s very common to get a ton of career and battlepass progression, don�t know if it will work for you but worth a try."
"I�m getting XP, but none of my operator challenges track. Anyone else have that issue?"
You're not alone bro there are many people reporting this bug. You can go play cold war they've got double exp now if you know what I mean.....
"I only get weapon xp 
No level xp and no operator challenge"
No MP xp here either. Not since 1.31. it's a fucking joke.
Same for me after last update
Activision is trying to push us to Cold War by releasing crap in MW.  Fix your problems. Cold War stinks.
"Getting no Xp at all, no score popping up when killing people, getting hard crashes to PlayStation menu, getting dev error crashes when trying to start multiplayer. Tried playing Cold War instead, no textures loading for maps, 90% audio cutting out, see through players. Absolutely fuck call of duty. I will never give these companies my money again. Pisses me off because when MW first came out it was amazing and gave that hype again since cod starting stagnating."
MW launch was the buggiest and unoptimized game I've ever played
Had a new bug today gamername dont update.. been playing against the same names all day
"variants you could use: ducat, banisher, and ultimatum to name a few"
Thank you!
"There is a blueprint I own that is already gold and I think when you put the camo on, it appears even more gold but I'd have to look not online right now"
When you can get back to me with that I'd appreciate it tons :)
Nah coldwar just took most of the sweats and the people who just wanna enjoy the game are still on mw
the sbmm is lighter bc less players
How much has the game changed? I stopped playing the game after the barrett came out. I have plans to buy it after i get my ssd working.
"modern warfare does skill based matchmaking. and cold war does performance based matchmaking..

based on your last match k/d they put you into a lobby

it was like that i don't know how it is now. since i don't even launch that anymore"
No MW had PBMM just like cw but everyone just calls it SBMM. Also  I played 10 matches today with a friend and only one of them was mildly sweaty
Cods always had sbmm. It�s probably felt stronger in recent cods because we don�t have persistent lobbies. When people are always starting new lobbies people of close skill now get put together more often since they�re not tied up in a lobby that could be full
"I�m glad you�re finding it that way, bro. Conversely, I loved the matchmaking prior to 1.31; it seemed like I gave as good as I got during almost every match. Now, I get wrecked more often than not. But I digress . . . enjoy!"
"Maybe you got shadow banned. But I don't think that's the case, check your NAT type, reinstall the game (and the anti cheat ((if this game even has one))), check if your MTU is not on 800. If it is change it."
I reinstalled the game thrice. Still the same issue. I would like to hear more about MTU doe what happens if I keep it on 800?

Great minds think alike. More like: everybody camps in this game
Everybody camp in this factory
Bruh moment
It always surprised me just how few players use the Spotter or E.O.D perk.
E.O.D perk is used massively
"It�s always PC players. I ran into a game with three spark/rainbow skins, somehow all of them manage to be wall hacking."
"Just like in shadow lobbies you see people with calling cards/emblems with a blank/default pink texture or an operator with a white/red spot ""default"" (place holder?) texture..."
"Credit to Name__less on twitter

For those that are unaware: sparks has 2 bundles with two outfits (kinda dumb but meh)

And soap has a challenge thing to unlock his other 2 uniforms"
How
NCR wants to know your location
Is it a Cold War gun? Haven�t played Cold War yet so idk
"No, this is on MW."
"Its bugged. Not released yet.

Only place you can try it out in buy it in survival mode or a rare chance to get it from the weapon drop field upgrade"
Thank you for the info.
It�s not in the game yet. At this point I kind of doubt it ever will be.
hah instant karma
"everyone is having this problem 
the challenges cant when track properly"
"Yeah, I�m trying to get the Ronin Samurai skins but they aren�t tracking. Anyone have an explanation for that?"
"Fuck if I have to see another one of these questions. You�re not meant to see the challenges, shit is bugged since second last update. Also, the ronin samurai skin has to be bought from its bundle pack, which they haven�t even released yet."
There is a warcom bundle in the store with the base skins for domino wyatt and golem - if you buy that they may track.
"those are old mission from S1, you weren't supposed to have them, it's a visual glitch that they show up, they didn't intentionally put those challenges there for us"
Really? Because one of the missions gives the MW S1 level 100 tier emblem. I thought they must of done it as a way for everyone to get the S1 stuff if they missed out (like myself).
"ZLR asp barrel, tac laser, sniper scope, Lapua rounds, Blitz stock."
"What game have you been playing? This game has been updating the playlist literally every week. It may not be with gamemodes you like, but it has been updated."
See I didn�t see that. I took a break and came back tonight. There�s no playlist update right now. So I assume I must had just missed it. Why not this week? I didn�t see any 24/7 list. Is there a different mode that�s this weeks list item?
"It's about the money, get people to pay for cold war"
"There is new content that�s been finished but for some reason they�re sitting on it for months. 

They aren�t the next game. MW sequel is going to be next year."
I have a feeling that some reason is that they aren�t going to release it and it instead is now content for the 2022 title.
"Yes.  Ill start with one game where i can do no wrong  and i down ppeople with 7 bullets and even when i get shot first, i can turn around and kill them.  Then the rest of the night im dropping 25 bullets into people and breaking them but never downing them, dying behind corners and shit like that"
"Yeah it�s ridiculous. Almost every single time I die, they have a pube of hair left after 483 rounds but yet I got peppered with 5 and I�m fully dead"
For the thermite I think I have a possible explanation. Because of the armor it takes longer for the thermite to down a player. So the guy you stuck probably had stims on him and healed himself to tank the damage.
Same here. There�s some times where I�ll point blank some guy and it wouldn�t kill him (my wifi is working well too) it pisses me off so much
It�s the artificial ping from the sbmm
Im startnig to believe activision has a similar system to fifa where the games are rigged to keep you spending money and playing more.
It�s been a glitch for weeks now.
is there a way i can fix it?
So advanced uavs show everyone on the map except people in your vicinity that have ghost. Feel like most people forgot tho if you pop 5 you get a counter uav going too. Unless that�s gone now. Haven�t seen anyone do it in a while. Might help fend off people knowing where you guys are.
"Popping 3 uavs is considered a ""Super uav"". It shows you all UN-GHOSTED players on the map and the direction they are facing in real time. However there are places like Stadium and the Train station. These places have small ""easter eggs"" and reward you with random things if you complete them.

For example Juggernauts(Removed), Specialist Perk, Foresight and a actual Advance UAV. When this actual Advance UAV is used it will show all UnGhosted players with the direction they are facing. But it will also show all ghosted players as red dots."
"Hello, I think I'm lost too!1.- Three UAV isn't an Advance UAV and can't show you gosted people ?2.- To show you gosted people, it's only the ""advanced UAV"" killstreak?"

Just got to keep getting crushed until that SBMM throws you a bone.
"Yep...two games i lost 6-5 in the final round, and then bam, five games i loose 6-1 in the first round..."
My teammate and I won 6-1 for all our games up to the finals.   Next game we were white washed 6-0.  I swear these people are streamers or something bc how tf do it go from winning to whitewashed In the first round
"I won one, then got 2nd, then won again. Had a few close matches and some washes. I dunno what it is but gunfight already makes me sweaty without putting the word tournament in front lol. Really cool gamemode."
merc foregrip is better for the aug because it has pretty straight recoil and the mono suppressor is almost always better because the downside is not noticable and it gives some extra range and bullet velocity
Commanding seems to be better from tests
Wrong sub go to warzone:)
Wait there is a warzone sub? I dont reddit often sorry
"Hey there couple tips for your mac10 - use the gallantry blueprint from the battlepass if you have it. The iron sights are cleaner. Secondly, swap out your fast mag for the drum mag. There is nearly no reload speed benefit to the fast mag, and it has significantly slower ads than the drum mag."
"Thanks alot dude, ill be trying what you said as soon as i come back from deployment"
"This is appearing for me too, i think it is challenges from old seasons. Damn shame we can't progress them, I wanted one of the executions from there."
You can complete them still
I've tried all of them and it still won't progress. I've restarted my console and tried a variety of things like that but it still wouldn't let me do it.
"tbh, I just feel like there's been a graphics downgrade since the intergration"
"Had that feeling too, uninstalled the game and redownloaded the complete game including campaign and coop. Had crisp graphics again since then."
I just wish they'd fix the cold war gun animations lol
"The implementation of cw weapons wouldn�t be bad if the balancing of the Mac/dmr came faster. The ground loot is the same as always, and there are still viable mw weapons. Hell, I use the grau and it definitely competes (grau/bruen are both still top tier primary weapons for example). Also, just the plain variety is nice. I�m not forced to play a stale game with the same ground loot. 

The battle pass isn�t a cash grab at all imo. Nobody is forcing you to spend money on it, and why should you if you haven�t bought and don�t intend to play cw?"
"I just hate all the spam telling me to buy the battlepass, I mean why would I buy something for a game I do not own"
I�m getting some weapon xp... still no player xp
"they fixed weapon XP gains, but overall, still messed. I've switched to Spec Ops for the moment, as all xp works there."
One of the CDL bundle camos it looks like
So the old ones that not available anymore
"It's the Seattle Surge cdl skin (old one / not available anymore).

I'm actually pretty happy that I got the Toronta Ultra one, not for the operator skins but for the weapon camos. They look awesome.

##"
"Unless you preordered Cold War, no"
Fuck
"Time Travel

But some say it doesn�t exist"
It did until my Delorean got hit by a train.
Somewhere it was stated that they are slowly going to be rolling out some of the operators + blueprints from the previous seasons. I hope so
"my brother and friend got the game after it launched and they have the blueprint 

i dont have it :/"
Would you like to see it with dmascus on it? I'll take pic if you want.
https://youtu.be/LB6OjmfCETA <<< the video of the optic
[removed]
The sight looks like is modeled after fancy military lmg optics. It also has a range finder which is cool. But is it a hybrid like the 4x flip hybrid or is it only one zoom level
"Yeah i saw the frony optic (without the magnifier) it looks like a aimpoint acro, but bigger... idk since iw dont use real names its harder to seach for it"
"We used to be able to. There was a bug where the blueprint preview would use whatever your lobby showcase camo was. Which was useful for wanting to see how a blueprint would look with a certain camo. That was patched out a while ago though. 

All you can do now is buy it and find out later. Unless you like what it looks like on its own I wouldn�t recommend it though."
Same past week I got the beer six pack charm and a animated calling card and emblem
Mine have been giving other rewards and not double xp tokens since the start of the season. But during season 6 all i would get was double xp tokens.
"I�m getting no xp in some games, and maybe 150 - 200 xp in other games."
"Damn that was some work either way, good job, btw what attachments are you running?"
"Mono supress, no stock, merc grip, conversian mag, stippled grip"
"Suppressor, foregrip, no stock, fast mags, and probably something else. I don't know, I just wanna put my guess in before OP answers."
"Oh, ak attachments...I�m so glad you gave me an excuse to tell everyone how I built my insanely powerful ak-74u which is just an ak but with smg speed.. ahem no stock, smallest barrel, 75 round drum mag, 5mw laser, and merc foregrip. Good day."
"I usually run rpk barrel skeleton stock 40 rnd mag muzzle break and rubberized grip, is this set up worth anything? Or should I try more meta"
"looks like: mono suppressor, merc grip, 5.45 mags, stippled, no stock


Source: I love this gun"
"Scratch that, that was my 144p quality."
Flawless victory!
Why is it I�m always on the other side of this mayhem lmao
"Looks sick, great job!"
Thank You!
I don't play Gunfight but I had to be on the winning team for two games for a mission challenge so gave it \[regular gunfight\] a go. Is it normal for your team to quit if you lose the first round? I got fed up with being the only player left and gave 3v3 snipers only a try and it's a much better experience.
Sometimes they do.   For me I used to quickscope for ages until I decided to camo grind so even if they quit In the first 2 rounds I still put up a fight haha
Get it obsidian it's easily the cleanest looking obsidian
Yeah that's what I'm working to
Its a bug that came up with the latest update sadly. It also broke splitscreen multiplayer for me and my dad. We crash at the map loading screen
"sorry to hear that, i hope it gets fixed soon because i dont really feel like playing the game"
"ima get downvoted to hell for this, return it, wait for mw2, this game is getting worse by the day, and devs are killing it. keep your $60 for mw2, that game better be great"
Im not getting any xp either!!! Must be a new bug im prestige 2 stuck at 59
"I would try out Warzone or Plunder for a bit, I believe it's double weapon xp this weekend. Otherwise maybe give Co-op Survival a go. You will have to buy the gun you want to level, but I've been having a lot of fun with it lately, since xp is bugged in multiplayer"
They took XP out of the game late in the battle pass to encourage you to buy Cold War.
"It was a bug. 

Stop attempting to spread conspiracy theories."
"It�s a known bug.

You�d of figured this out if you searched it, literally every other post is about it."
"and how was i supposed to know this was a bug? because honestly thats the dumbest bug ever literally not being able to level up, thats why i didnt search for it"
"You may have to reinstall the game as it was a bug but recently got patched.  If that doesn�t work you can level up in co-op special ops.

Edit:  the first commenter was that way because we had so many posts about the experience bug for the last week it dominated the sub."
"The XP bug is something many players are getting, not being able to earn player XP so can�t level up."
Also splitscreen on multiplayer is broken. 9/10 it crashes on the map loading screen
Yeah I've been experiencing the same thing and talking to other players about. It's a common bug from the last update and I'm not sure if activision or infinity ward are making any active attempts to fix it. It's been more than a week and I feel such a game breaking bug would have been resolved by now.
They took XP out of the game late in the battle pass to encourage purchase of Cold War.
All the glory to your name.
Activision has 0 support. Probably the only huge company with 0 support.
"How can you expect an indie publisher to support more than two games at a time? C'mon man, be realistic."
"MW and MP in general including CW is abandoned and it will remain like that. Go back to MW2 and BO2 and it is infested with hackers, why should they care now?"
Where is dev support? In cold war..
"They don't care about MP anymore

&#x200B;

It's all about Warzone, Warzone brings in the views on Twitch and the money for them"
"Warzone, just like any other battle royale will lose its player base after time. 

Multiplayer on COD has always been a flocking point for fps players. 

Surly Activision realizes that their current business model of abandoning support for a year old game will eventually lead to their overall failure. Someone will learn from their mistakes and make something better for the market, and activision's reputation will be ruined beyond repair."
I�m guessing most of them were moved to dev the 2021 cod
"activision support is non existent if you write with them they just tell you to wait while doing nothing 

my account got hacked over 8months ago and every time i ask live support they say that they are working on it and that i need to wait LOL"
This has been posted a million times before. First cod game huh? Activision always drops support for cod games after the next one releases
The only way to bring about change is to raise awareness. Even if it seems pointless. The more people that talk about this issue the better.
"I'm currently using the Striker and the sights are great. To the point where I'm not taking the -4ms ADS hit for a red dot, which I do for everything else."
"Getting good with iron sights is a good skill to have. The extra attachment slot can be pretty nice. 

The Scar is definitely my favourite iron sights. They're very clean"
"I love the Striker irons, I don't know why so many of my friends insist on using sights for it"
"Happened to me a few months back, took them around 10 days to get it back to me if I remember correctly, all you really can do is wait sadly. Good luck"
Did you end up getting your account back?
it's just a bug. you can't do them. they are not supposed to be showing.
"See thats what i thought, i knew i recognized a few from earlier seasons, my god this game is so busted"
"The missions are from bundles from the in-game store, some are sold like gaz's. But some are from unreleased bundles, like mara's missions, rodion's and some others"
"Ive also come to find out that its apparently a second chance for season 2 accounts 






Which sucks because i had to make an alt mid season 6's lifetime"
A surgical longshot... very nice.
A surgical *yeeted* longshot...
Title why
"If you look at my username, I�m obviously terrible at naming things..."
I�m just happy with my platinum AR and SMG. Platinum looks way better to me than Damascus.
"I'm still trying for gold on one of my weapons (like one skin away from it on the MP7), I have seen what Plat looks like and I do like it better, tbh, I'm not a fan of Damascus, but I do wanna have it just as a flex, y'know?"
"as a person who has damascus, platinum looks way better and i prefer it more lmao"
"Agree, demascus is way to ugly. Only Plat and Obsidian for me. I have all my ARs And SMGs Plat and I have obsidian for my AK47 and CR-56."
Same I have Damascus but only use platinum and Obsidian (gold AK and pistols)
Trust me the moment you get Damascus that changes. I didnt see the Damascus hype until I got it and now I never use platinum except in a few specific cases (like Oden black asp)
Doing the JOKR nearly broke me
Dude the riot shield is what broke me. That shit took me like 3 weeks alone to do just because of how hard that shitty *�get 3 kills without dying challenge�* was
I ain't looking forward to the launchers
"Couldn�t care less about an ugly camo, I got plat for my snipers, pistols and lmgs and gold for the other guns I actually use, that�ll do.

EDIT: I can�t English"
"I don't see any problems with your English, but I don't know too much about it either, so I'm not authority. Honestly, though, Damascus is one of the uglier camos in the game, so I hear that, I like to have something to grind for. I'll end up giving up after a year anyway, but for now, I'm working towards it."
TOO BUSY GETTING SNIPED HALF WAY ACROSS THE MAP FROM HACKERS.....
"Yeah, hackers have become a real problem recently. I've been running into more and more wallhacks (maybe some aimbot as well, but that one's harder to be sure of when they're tryna hide it)."
too many stupid tedious bullshit required to bother. im happy with gold and never using shields for anything
Dude that shield broke me. That shit sucks so badly that I�m suprised that I actually got it. It took me over a month just to do the get 3 kills without dying challenge done
On every weapon even the unnecessary ones.
"Same here, now trying to get some obsidians, but that shit is fucking tedious, the amount of matches with 14 kills is insane"
Way to commit! I don't think I'll have the patience to do the unnecessary ones!
brooooo where are the irl weapon mods from season 5 and 6?
I have it on the crossbow and I don't know why I did that to myself
cant even level up my guns to unlock skin categories so theres no point even considering it now
"Went for it because it�s the best looking camo I�ve ever seen, no regrets"
"diggin' it! I prefer BO4 dark matter to any other CoD camo, but I can see the appeal."
Only try hards have that camo. It�s funny how hard they try lol
"Nah, Obsidian is the try hard camo. Damascus just means you've played a lot"
It�s more of a grind instead of a try hard thing. Obsidian is the try hard camo whereas damascus is more of a grind camo
"You do have to try for camos, that's for sure. I'll prolly rage quit before I even get close, but the grind is fun."
"No it�s not. I didn�t try hard at all and I got it in less than 3 days in game over the shoot the house playlist two weeks ago(?) don�t remember exactly when it was.

EDIT: I started when shoot the house playlist began and finished it in about a week and a half already having 3 guns gold. Other than that I started from the start. My guns were leveled up from warzone though so that helped"
ive gotten it when mw was still not as shitty as it is now. i grinded it from season 5 to season 7 because back then small maps compilation was a thing and shoothouse/shipment 24/7 where always there a week before a season ends.
I ended up getting it around this same time last year when lockdowns initially started.Decided to do it to kill time
I almost have it on a second account now. The main account has it on every gun+dlc weapons.
I have Damascus and some guns obsidian and people act like they�ve never seen anyone with obsidian and I�m �a sweat� lol the game is over a year old
"Yea, I slogged through getting Damascus in season 4. Wasn�t really worth it. Didn�t bother with the Crossbow, kali sticks, or dual swords."
"I�m on PS4, weapon XP appears fixed.  Still getting zero game XP."
"Same here, but I still get sporadic match XP. Nothing like it should be though."
"It�s still broken for me,
I�m on pc"
I'm getting weapon xp and random amounts of match xp. I'm on ps5

"That kind of thing happened to me earlier (not that many colors) and I thought it was really cool for about 2 seconds, then I crashed. The fun was short-lived, but I loved it!"
Activision really promoting Cold War with the neon 80�s colors in MW
That actually looks amazing! :O
This is the second time it's happened though the first one wasn't as colorful
"Don't do drugs kids, you'll see things, and probably lose your eyesight if your brightness is to high"
"Forget it, the challenge is bugged."
"I have to say I agree with your argument and you presented it very well.  And yes, they are exploiting and therefore should receive a permanent ban."
Thank you for your reply
I strongly disagree. As someone who is usually a 1.3 k/d or above in every shooter I play I can honestly say I'm a casual because I don't play video games to be competitive I just happen to play video games often because I don't watch any form of TV. Given the fact that Ive played shooters so much for the better part of a decade I'm bound to be decent but that doesn't mean I'm a sweat. It just means that I have an above average skill set. That doesn't mean I deserve to be lumped in with people who do play seriously or competitively. If your argument is that it isn't fun for others then that's a personal issue on their behalf. If they were willing to put the time in to be decent they wouldn't go out bad every time they touch the controller. It isn't my fault they play the game less frequently than I do and I shouldn't be punished for doing so. I wouldn't even have a problem with the mm if it was implemented in a ranked mode like any fighting game but punishing players and assuming they must not have a life because they are decent at a video game isn't the way to go. If anything I'll just uninstall and go back to battlefield which in my case is my preferred shooter in the first place.
"If you�re being put into competitive lobbies, you�re not playing casually."
Shits breached.
"Again? That�s whack man.. I lost it in the first breach. I had 2 factor auth turned on, HOW?!"
"My Activision account was stolen, and I now know who is using it.  It's been a week and I haven't heard anything, and there is no one to contact to update the ticket.

If an account transfer or unlink/relink is requested, it should take *at least* 3 business days, and undoing it back to an account that's been linked for MANY YEARS, should be AUTOMATIC.  I've had an Activision account linked to my xbox gamertag for as long as that has been possible, and in one night it's gone.

I had All BP content from MW seasons 3-6, Damascus, and a good amount of season 1 challenges, including completed Zombies S1.  I got a Dark Ops done the night it was stolen, and I feel sick.  The account thief is in another country- do they think I left the country  and got set up 4 hours after I last played?  He's a free to play PC player who only plays warzone, so even if I get my account back and he gets banned, he loses nothing, he'll just make another account and ruin someone else's day."
"I had my account liked to my account since MW3.. I feel your pain bro. All I can do is wait the 10 business days, and hope to get some good news back."
I had every single officer challenge seasonal emblem seasons 1-6..
"Hey man, did you ever get your account back? Mine has been stolen just today. I tried to confront the person via my brothers account adding the player via the Activision ID. He left the party and came offline all together. So far activision gave me a case number but haven�t replied to any private messages at all"
"I�m still in the process of trying to get mine back as well. It really sucks that this is happening to so many people, and Activision isn�t even acknowledging it�s happening."
login not working is not the same thing as stolen account. are you playing on PC? blizzard login and activision login are two separate things. go to your accounts in web browser and see if they are still linked. if you can't log in there is password recovery.
I�m on PS4. The ID was unlinked from my PSN without my knowledge
"My brothers account was stolen months ago, they finally gave it back to him and it was banned because who ever stole it was using hacks. Been like a year now and they don�t even reply back to him anymore. Can�t even play the game he owns since it�s linked to his gamer tag and you can�t unlink."
noscope*?
Do you happen to be using Mactype?
I have no idea what it is :)
Yeah. I play on PlayStation and I�m getting good do half the time and the other half I get maybe 250 for 30+ kills. This shit is getting really old. I�m having to do the same to level up. They need to fix it and extend the battle pass because of this shit.
"Same, I literally just had SHIPMENT and only got 800xp for 63 kills like wtf"
"For me, the progress wheel comes up post match, but it doesn't move, no xp shown in MP. I was just playing WZ and I'm not great, but still only getting 300xp or so per match..."
"Still doesn't work for me. I got some when I completed the daily challenges but that was it.

Great work."
"Yeah Activision has totally abandoned this game, played 3 matches of TDM yesterday and only got 300 xp. They are no longer going to get my money, I'm not paying $70 to $130 for a game that has a 1 year life cycle."
"I typically try to buy these games on sale at least, because of the short life span of them. You aren't wrong though, it is frustrating"
Activision no longer updates. The company whom updates now is called Raven Software.
"I thought the latest update would fix the game. Nope, still seeing inconsistent hit detection, reticles not popping up right away (even worse than before), AND I�m still Rank 7, unable to level up cause the XP is still broken. 
I put in a support ticket today, under the report-a-bug directory or whatever. Fuck these Developers."
I�ve put in 3 tickets so far.  I just bought the game last week on a PS Store sale and I�m still stuck at Level 1.
Known bug they do not do shit about it
Yeah its frustrating because I'm stuck playing WZ solos if I want any XP
Mines fixed as of the last patch.
all of a sudden im getting XP today on the weapons i wasnt getting XP on last week
"Yeah its weird, I was hoping the update today would have fixed it..."
They took XP out of the game late in the battle pass to encourage purchase of Cold War.
Do you really believe that? My WZ xp is broken too...
Am I the only one who is actually getting XP for weapons and progression? I'v had the no hitmarkers and reticle bug but XP has been fine for me.
"Wondering the same. I play TDM (6v6 & 10v10), Hardpoint, Domination, etc pretty regularly and have been ranking up just fine. Unlocked quite a few new attachments and leveled up my AUG too yesterday and today. Hitmarkers seem a lil glitchy on bullet impact at times but overall everything has been fine for me as well"
"See I haven't had hit marker issues but, I've had reticle, progression, and weapon xp issues...battle pass seems ok"
Which platform do you play on?
"I'm on ps4 and I'm not getting any xp after my matches for my rank, ive been stuck at rank 31 for weeks now, I can still get xp if I'm playing with my friends in warzone but that's it."
"I was getting xp in WZ only, but it seems like thats been bugged too...in MP I only got xp if I completed challenges, in the match summary it would show 0 xp..."
I'm earning zero XP too so I'm with you...it sucks
Still today? I was playing last night a bit and it was sporadic
For the past week or so I've been getting weapon xp no problem. But I'm still not getting multiplayer xp and it's really annoying. Doesn't make any sense. Especially since there's been an update since it started and it didn't fix it.
"Yeah I'm in the same boat, weapon xp and battle pass have both been progressing. Only time I get progression xp is from challenges."
"Nope I thought it wasnt even giving out xp anymore. I'm stuck in prestige level 1 and everytime I win, the wheel doesnt advance at all."
"Yeah, the progress bar doesn't move at all for me, doesn't even say I get any xp"
"I got match XP (like a flat amount of 2500) in a round of Hardpoint.

Weapons level but none of that XP goes to my level progress and no other XP for playing is given (no score for kills, holding objectives, etc)"
So you didn't get any level xp added to your progress bar? Yeah sounds like its all sorts of broken...
I played a few games trying to unlock the new pistol that hasn't been released and was wondering why i was getting 0 XP....havent played MW since CW came out....i guess this is why?
"I read an article earlier saying Raven has patched the bug earlier in the week, but seems like people are still having issues..."
Not a fan of the hardpoint?
its the one with the rail
"Ah nice, I was hoping it would be that one. Thanks"
"Kali sticks, you run faster and glue onto your opponent with lunge


The sword are heavy and dont have any lunge"
they dont have any lunge but you can kill someone at 2.5 meters while sliding which is absurd
"No it's not, any sniper can hipfire fine"
Whats the point of this post?
"An attempt to get fake internet points with cringy 3v1 sniper gunfight ""game play""."
They just added the hotfix to sort it out
Oh hell yeah!!!!! The second I get home I am gonna download it. Thanks man
I can�t get camos on CW guns...
"I am so sad looking back at the release of mil-sim skins, and realizing I was only one season away from getting them (I joined in season 4, I think). They look sooo good."
"I really hope they come back in a bundle. Those season 3 mil sim skins are insanely good. Just sticking all of them in a bundle for like 1600CP would be fair imo. 

The S3 battlepass was the first one I bought and I still pretty much exclusively use those skins. Unfair that other people can't get them just because they were a little late"
No you missed the old ones that�s on you
"Dont know why hes being downvoted when hes right

The best op can expect are the supposedly upcoming vaultpacks"
"Been on Cold War for a bit and haven�t been on This subreddit a whole lot, so coming across this post and seeing crash got me missing modern warfare so damn much."
you say that like you can�t play it anymore lol
Didnt know they added Goku as a operator
Get wrecked kar kiddie
680 with the slug mag is really fun.
"Yeah, the 680 is pretty much the only shotgun I like to use in MW"
Despite being t r a s h it�s actually scary on the origin 12 if you build it right
"Overall I like the slugs on the 680, R90 and the VLK. 

I've gotten over 1000 kills with slugs on the VLK (making my way to obsidian using slugs), it provides a level of forgiveness with the fire rate and damage output. Besides I like to hear my enemies get salty when I shoot them across the map :)"
"i was playing around with the vlk recently and its like a quickscoping shotgun when used with slugs, its pretty fun"
Why is the 725 so good in multi (I play hardcore) and so bad in warzone? Did they nerf it to hell? Did i miss something?
"this poll is for shotguns when used with slugs, as for the 725 with buckshot, its so good because it can easily kill with one shot from a very good distance even in core, but in warzone the 2 shots are barely enough for a kill and you have to be very accurate with the shots. r90 with dragons breath is a lot better for warzone"
"The VLK Rogue is the best slug-gun all-around.

I'm chalking the low numbers down to first impressions."
"it can be really good with slugs, but it is hard to use."
I love shotguns but slugs make it too unreliable (atleast in wz)
"even in MP they are too unreliable, but i like to use slugs for the challenge"
i had it and managed to shoot him trough the wall in his feet. the wall penetration was very weak but i killed him
"Yep, has happened to me once before. You essentially have to restart unless you can snipe them."
"I just made a post on how the game updated like 4 times by now including the 11 GB, Update Requires restart, 200 MB update and finally a playlist update for MW which I do not know what even changed. 

Suffered performance issues so what I am going to do right now is re-install the game and see if the problems are still present and if they are wait until they fix the freaking game."
"I installed each add on individually, instead of everything at once and that seemed to help. I�m able to play now and hadn�t got kicked once yet!"
I feel bad for people like that. Room temperature IQ and stuff. They don�t know any better. Hopefully one day he�ll do it to someone in person and get domed
"Dam that's like the first time I've heard the term, ""room temperature IQ."" Thanks to you ima use it now!"
The modern warfare 2 is strong with this one
"�It�s COD, everyone�s racist.� -some random I heard say last night when someone said the hard R"
"the button already exists, it's called ""Mute Lobby"". along with block player. 

The report language button was actually there till like half a year ago. They got rid of it because... it did nothing. Unless you want activision to record all voice chat and keep it on their servers."
"They do it for Xbox game chat, I'm pretty sure it won't be a problem."
"Just mute them. I get that he's being racist, but what do you think ACTV can do about it? It's just the words of a salty player, he's being racist, ignore him, he doesn't deserve anyone's time anyway."
This is why I disable voice chat when I play alone
Why
You serious rn?
I think I played with those guys. The voice is recognizable.
So you've played search before?
"These are all the same ppl. They just say the word to ""troll"". They are hoping you react negatively and talk shit back. They just want to know that they ""got to you"". These ppl say this in chat and over mics, but never irl cause they'd get dropped."
Same had someone yell the n word in a lobby today
End of match lobbies for warzone modes is just screeching or the n word. Or the one in 300 gg respectable gentleman's lobbies.
"Jeez, that�s rough... People on COD are and always have been assholes. They were born down south and grew up racist and stupid. They�re just scumbags man, don�t let em get to you, that�s how they win"
It�s a call of duty lobby what did you expect?
"They used to have that but when they took a stance against racism, they removed the ability to report people for it because that'd be too much work"
How poor acting is this. Cmon we are livin in 2021 and still this shits??? Motherf\*\*\*\*ing cavemans.
It's part of the Call of Duty drawl and they know these idiots are their bread and butter.
Same meta
You mean Grau and MP 5 all the time?
Meta guns are probably mp5 and as val. But there�s a couple good guns in each category that are hard to put over one another. Mp5 and Uzi are the most competitive smgs. Assault rifles as val i�d say is the best but close behind are the m4 and amax followed by the grau.
Is the the player base still in good shape? Or the most people on Warzone and Cold War?
Not much has changed since then
"I mean it�s a great game and I love it but it�s in a pretty fucked up state. Especially xp bugs, which have had some fixes but I�ve seen most people still reporting issues"
Same since the update!! It very frustrating!!
They didn't think it fair for MW players to not have the Cold War experience.
"Cold War PC performance is beyond horrendous.

Like I eventually got Cyberpunk 2077 to play decently with a 3070 and a 8700k and a respectable frame rate/graphics quality.

Cold War? 30fps. Stuttering. Frozen. Textures won�t load properly. It�s a fucking mess."
"> Frame drops constantly while performing different actions 

Since yesterday�s update, my maximum fps are 63. It�s the same to set lower resolution or higher. Set unlimitted fps limiter, set 300 fps on AMD control panel.  
Always are 63 fps (or less with explosions).

Right now it�s unplayable for me cuz stutters af and the tearing is horrible."
"My overall performance hasn't been touched at all this patch however whenever I respawn, every 2-3 lives or so, my game will just hold up for 1-2 seconds which is a pain in the ass sometimes. 

Didn't use to happen before"
Yup frame stuttering and dropping on xbox one
I�ve been trying to do this but a mix of my teammates being trash and my internet prevent me from doing this lol
This is going to shock you.. it looks like... an ak47.
Oh.  My.  Gosh.   Could it be true?
wow
"Everything that's wooden gets replaced with black composite, except for the rear grip, which stays as is. This is honestly my favorite blueprint in the shop."
The stock is black which IMO is BS.
An Ak47
Ayyo anybody know how to get this now? It�s not in the armory or next to the AK in create a class I�m assuming it�s in rotation?
"I submitted a ticket. I'm tired of this game breaking itself.

It's frustrating having to reinstall data packs (which takes forever). It's like they're purposely destroying the game so people get fed up and move onto Cold War, or something."
"In this specific case (split screen), Cold War is even worse. I downloaded it during the free Zombies weekend and the game wouldn�t even let me activate split screen. No idea why they struggle with it. From what I�ve read even the PS5 has issues so it can�t be hardware related."
I deleted the entire game and reinstalled it and it didn�t help : (
"Same here. My dad and I cant play anymore because it crashes 9/10 times on map loading screen.

Will submit ticket"
Ticket submitted. The game crashes every other match... a bit ago the game audio crashed (not the PS4 system audio). It�s easily crashed 8 times today and yesterday.
"Yep same here, it's so frustrating. Recently bought this game and it's irritating we can't play split screen anymore. 

We decided to buy CoD Cold War and split screen is even more of a nightmare. It has black bars on the side of the screen and after one game everyone turns invisible and the only fix is to restart. We just want our CoD fix somehow :("
"If they fix it then it�ll be a great experience! Until now, my gf and I have been playing MW since October 2019, and it�s been great. The best COD I�ve played since Black Ops."
Same here and I�ve submitted a ticket to get told the default scripted crap...
"I clicked on the link and signed in but can�t seem to locate where to submit the support ticket. Help please :)

Edit: found it and submitted!"
Aha sorry! Glad you found it
Did this get fixed with the patch or not?
"Nope. Still broken, just tried :("
It keeps crashing to dashboard.
"I played split screen once recently, and my game started crashing after every match after that for a few days, even when I wasn't playing split screen. It's never crashed before in my life."
"I played split screen once recently, and my game started crashing after every match after that for a few days, even when I wasn't playing split screen. It's never crashed before in my life."
"Also submitted a ticket, hopefully this gets fixed ASAP!"
This is happening to me as well very frustrating hopefully it�s on there radar
"Same here, St Petrograd and Aniyah Incursion are the only maps working for us."
"Submitted! Thanks very much for this! It�s so frustrating , I�m PS4 but apparently it happens for Xbox too"
This is annoying.
Very. Still not fixed.
This legitimately works 2/2 so far!!! From not working at all!
Bet it didn�t work after lol
Check my page for solution
I�m fucking sick of this game crashing lately. It�s so annoying
Have you tried playing MW MP? It is a performance mess and I can't even get started lol
"Omg this happening with me too, and happens in infected ground."
"Personally, fucking tired of mnk players"
i'm on controller but same
"Maybe that sticky aimbot starting around 0:22 had something to do with it?

Stop using aimbot. Now go play something else.

Thank you."
That just looks like aim assist to me dude
What sticky aimbot lol? Regardless of using hacks or not OP is right the game is an extreme buggy awful mess lol
You would think a user who posts hackers would know the difference between somebody walking into a stream of bullets and an actual hacker
sorry that i can kill my enemies in a game where you have to try and kill your enemies
"you can look at my reddit profile if you wanna see some even more suspicious kills, it's the nuke clip."
"Nice, how many games did you tank to get those reverse boosted bots?"
Wdym?
How are you moving so fast
Crack
That�s not you being good chap whoever you�re playing against are absolute bots
Bruh it�s a game clip calm you tits
"one and a half year too late mate, but hope something like this will be in MW2"
True
yeah that�s true. it would be so sick if this happened for mw2!
"Wait so if the enemy team kills the entire nuke team, died that mean they win? Seems like a bad idea isince nukes are so hard to get if it's like that"
"good point, i think the nuke team should still win. after all the outcome would be what we have now anyways (both teams dead) if the enemy team kills the whole winning team. the extraction would just give the winning team a chance to escape with their lives"
*slow clap*
Crazy good!!!
HaCkeR
Is this the first gunfight tournament since the last season of MW? Took a hiatus from MW for the past few months and just logged in today to catch this blueprint lmao. Hope I didn�t missed any prior
"Since the integration this is the first one, you didn't miss any"
Kinda shitty the ads wrap doesn't change with comp camo like other blueprint.
Yeah it�s one of the best attachments and it looks mad ugly
u/lightningmcqueen1221 there it is
"Thank you! It looks much better in gold. Again, thanks :)"
Lol shit I just posted it myself and it�s a duplicate.
The platinum camo looks surprisingly good on this imo
Love how it looks
"I like Plat. I got this blueprint yesterday but don't know which weapon it's for, is it the FFAR (I don't play CW or WZ)?"
this is the FR 5.56 in modern warfare
Is the gun still available??
"Nope, yesterday another tournament was active with a Origin 12 blueprint but i don't know if is still there. 

This one Famas is gone."
"Gotta post this here since my threads keep getting deleted. I just got all the way to finales pretty much by myself. Every round i'd finish with 12 kills while my teammate finished 0-6. Not saying i'm a God at the game but when I finally carried it to the finale to get the blueprint that I want really bad btw, I only got 3 wins off a same names, same clan duo that were obviously going to be doing well seeing as they were the best team on the other side. So why give me a teammate like that? If you're going to be putting me in matches with people at my skill level, give me teammates with my skill level. Again, not saying i'm perfect at the game but to have nothing but deaths and no kills, I didn't deserve that. Fuck sbmm, it only works as a punishment."
"Private Match vs Bots

Seen this skin and a different variant with the Baseball cap backwards instead of helmet and balaclava.

Is this new / To be released?"
Those are default operators. Default operators have different appearances based on what weapons they equip.
"Those are the default operators that were in game right from release. Default operators change camo depending on map. If you choose default on Ahzir Cave you get a desert camo, you get this woodland camo in maps like Grazna Raid, and some other maps with default skin."
Would be nice to see in game
"It is in game, the basic Mil-Sim skin changes depending on Map and weapons being used."
I get this too. I get some kind of spike during gunfights too which is super annoying.
I play on a gaming monitor at 120mhz on a hardwired connection and do experience those things in some games.
Same.
"After that 11gb update, everything perform like shit fr and its frustrating as fuck especially during gunfight."
Do you play with anything that�s Bluetooth? maybe it could be interference coming from an external device. I know sometimes my game trips out whenever my mouse and AirPods are connected at the same time.
Yeah
"To ""fix""  just cap your frames. I used to set my games'  frames at my monitor refresh rate 240. In MP I would get 170-200 frames. After CW integration my fps would drop from 180 average to 120-130 ever 5 seconds. So I just capped my frames at 144. No more stuttering."
I have stuttering with fps capped too. I got always 140 fps but when it stutter they drop around 137
"you mean gun game?

still noice"
Ah crap yeah I�ll edit that thanks for pointing that out
"Right in the dick, perfect shot"
Oh yeah. Always makes me laugh when that happens.
Noice.
You have make Shinobi very proud
Pyjamas > spaghetti
But you can�t eat pyjamas
That was nasty. Nice kill!
Thank you
Nice
"No you just haven�t unlocked the rest of the slots yet, they start showing up later don�t worry"
You�ve not leveled the gun enough. Keep playing and you will unlock more attachments.
"Its only level 6. You need to rank it up to make the other attachments available.  


The ones you cant see will still be on the gun"
Dude you are only at gun lvl 6 ...
I didn�t know that u unlocked slots as u go my bad
Yes it�s because your gun isn�t a high enough level to get the other attachments level the gun up a few times and it will unlock other attachment slots.
You�ll see more as you level up
Oh thanks
You unlock the other slots as you level the gun up
"Ive only had it when starting up the game. 
Plus sometimes the game says it's launched and I can't see anything but a black screen.  Minimizing and re opening works to avoid it. Somehow (On start up)"
"That�s so weird, I barely make it through one match and boom. I�m gone"
Yes! My game has been freezing and crashing mid game (like 4th round of S&D) and I have been suffering from Packet Loss
"So weird, and every time I enter the code in Google, no one has ever got the same one I did"
"You can try ticking full screen optimization and run as administrator in your compatibility tab in properties of mw.exe

I don't know if it'll work or not cause my game runs fine after this"
"I�ll have to give that a try, appreciate it"
"It's a communication error with the server that holds your account unlocks, just try rebooting the PS4 and if it's still not fixed, wait a while and try again later. Don't make changes to your account."
"Guess I should've noted the first thing I tried was a reboot. But I'll try logging in tomorrow to see if that helps, thanks."
Same thing happened to me yesterday with the log in thing and I was hoping my acc wasn't messed with. Thankfully everything was normal but I think it should be a server side issue.
I also had this same issue. I went to the activision website and linked my ps4 account which was weird because I had already done it before. It said it was linked again and now my account loaded up fine. Might have been an issue with psn but Idk.
"Oof. I hope this isn't the only solution because that button on the website doesn't take me to the Sony log in page, just refreshes the Activision website."
"Sounds like you got hacked. At least based on what others have described as happening to them. If it turns out you did get hacked and it doesn't fix itself, you have my condolences. Just don't forget to contact Activision support if you want a chance at getting it back."
"You think so? How would they hack my account if it's linked to the ps4? I've never been able to successfully link an Activision account to the ps4 because that button always glitches out on the website, and I have 2FA on my PSN."

"Problem is people camp with it, also imo its annoying that you cant kill them from behind"
People don't like it because it's annoying
Repulsive video
People don�t like it because it takes 0skill to use
Why does everyone complain about getting it gold?
"It's more annoying as a secondary imo because you are very hard to hit from behind, while still being well armed with a gun in hand"
I feel sick
Seems like a lot of people here can't throw thermite/semtex. Or simply move fast and let latency give them a shot.
"I play a run and gun playstyle and use the shield on my back with Overkill, I never swap to it though and just use it for pure protection. 

Idk why people get so mad about it though, like, when tf am i ever going to use a secondary? I would rather have some solid protection from behind instead"
"And there's thermites, semtex, and a whole crossbow with explosive bolts just to counter the shield. Nothing wrong with it at all"
Probably downvoted due to the annoyance of dealing with it. It just takes a few seconds (easy on a death screen) to switch to a good counter.
Oh but I thought bugs were fixed.. taking it you�re still not getting XP? Game is a fucking joke
eh im getting weapon xp like normal but the soldier xp is really inconsistent. sometimes i receive it and sometimes i dont at the end of the match.
Still looks pretty cool tho lol
"ground war has been horrible lately, I hope when i get my ps5 it becomes a little better"

"My comment from another post:

�It�s a debate bw core vs hardcore players. basically it boils dow to ttk meaning it�s much harder to kill someone in core versus HC. Yet it�s much easier to die in HC. I myself really like HC. It makes you super keen on aim and instincts. You learn the maps much better (no mini maps unless you�ve got a uav). Much easier to flush out campers and I find the pace faster. Plus killstreaks are way more prevelant. Also a great way to grind camos.�

Edit: also, all guns are viable in HC. I love the Desert Eagle and Renetti bc of HC. Pistols are great and I run and gun. My K/d is terrible but I have fun and play the objective."
I honestly prefer hardcore but that�s probably because I used it to get damascus and I got way to used to it and I can�t go back to core. I don�t know why but hardcore also feels more casual to me because I can use whatever I want and you don�t have to deal with the stress of being in the middle of getting shot because it ends as quickly as it began.
"Hardcore almost solely relies on positioning and reaction speed,core you have to consider the strengths and weaknesses of your loadout, movement ,map awareness etc."
"Definitely in core iv been killed in spots that iv never expected, i really like playong core because i can space out a little"
"Honestly I just like hardcore because it�s not as important to adhere to the meta. But yeah, fuck em, core stomp away"
Ak op in hardcore
"I came from the realm of Halo SWAT, so naturally HC appeals to me more.

Honestly what keeps me off of Core is the killcams. I don't care to mash skip every time, just put me back in already!"
"Haven't really played hardcore since bo2, but especially back then hardcore was the ez mode where people had pretty bad aim and bad game sense. It was nice for getting kill chains though

Oh yea, i did play a few games in hardcore on mw (maybe 500 kills), but they were also very easy."
Didnt olay bo2 online becauss (no xbox live) butfrom what youv said it definitely changed in mw.
"Hardcore is such a snooze fest, it's so quite and everyone's just soundwhoring for footsteps. But on the flip side pretty much any weapon is viable so you don't have to deal with AS Val tryhards and can use whatever you feel like."
"Where can i get people in these comments lobbies, i normally get un lobbies with lvl 200s who sprint, drop shot, jumpshot, and slide around for kills, few campers"
"In hardcore players are less likely to run and gun. More like run to a corner and camp/hold a LOS.

I prefer Core because it feels like there�s more action happening at a faster pace. Not so much in MW because the TTK is so quick but it�s great to turn on someone and shit on them which isn�t possible in HC most of the time."
"The only thing i hate about core is that the meta makes big difference. But in Hc, all guns are almost same and you can fight back with weakest guns even."
"Definitely this is true I see in core most people use things like assault rifles SMGs because the time to kill on shotguns and pistols a lot of the times is really bad, whilst in hardcore you can pretty much see every weapon in use ,you've got your pistols your shotguns anything that can be used to kill someone is used to kill someone.I've also noticed in core that a lot more people use Shields which makes sense because if you get shot you're not going to die immediately and you can beat people up with the shield I guess"
"Core is for the Overwatch converts.

Hardcore is for those who want headshots to actually count."
The calling card is worth it i�d say. It�s slightly animated as well if you care.
Nice I�ll have to check it out!

"Right Ok I see, I probably hadn�t played since summer last year but I did a bit more reading on the sub it seems they have fixed the weapon xp but not the rank. 
As I said it doesn�t matter as I still have all my unlocks I would just rather not be level 2! 

Thanks for your response!"
I used double XP and the gun XP glitch got fixed
Tried it. Thrice. No luck.
Having the exact same issue as well right now. Came here to see if there were others...
"Last update caused my game to crash to home on XSX after about 20 minutes. Now it�s about 5.  This mainly happens when playing couch co-op, but also happens playing solo. Does not matter if I am playing multiplayer or Warzone."
"Same, been that way since the recent update.  Xbox Series X"
"I have been having the same issue, and it has only started in the past week. At a loss for what to do."
Ever figure this out? Mine still does it. Been trying for an hour tonight.
Sorry for the late response. Never got it sussed. I have worked out it will load some maps but there's no rhyme or reason to that either. So far it's been Shipment and Petrov Oil rig but that's it
Any fixes yet?

"It's not a mode we've played before I don't think? So it just looks like how you should play it to me. Seems like search with longer plants, so probably need the shield to win if you're actually capturing vs tryin to team wipe."
"Riot shield should be used more imo, but with actual skill, it's an excellent weapon when used tactically. I'd like to see you use it as an offensive weapon, I've a slide jump combo that makes people panic when you close the distance!"
trashy
trashy
I�m not getting server errors maybe try resetting your game or Xbox.
"Hardpoint is your best bet, every kill where either you or the victim is on the point counts as both an attacker and defender kill, plus people will obviously gravitate and stay at the hardpoint"

"Thats... actually pretty good skin tbh (I mean model itself, not camo). Looks similar to Code Breaker, so if nobody have it (or OG Iskra's bundle) it good chance to have one"
"Its green skulls, i like the camo itself but it is already in game for every weapon (the green skulls pattern i mean""."
"Congrats for the win.
I've been trying it but I can't get even finals."
"Keep trying you�ll get there, it�s all about getting paired up with somebody good"
Looks really dope tbh and plus the FR is a SLEEPER. People we�re freaking out that this would be a Cold War weapon
I was already ready to accept that when I saw the icon pop up on my screen lol. I was like cool a gun.. probably cw though
How do you unlock it?
"Tournament on the playlist if you win it, tournament came out today"
It�s still 3 round burst right?
Yeah
"It looks decent. But tbh i kind of wish the gun skins for 1st place had more to them. Maybe something to make the decals stand out more. Or even a unique looking variant of the gun, similar to how some other blueprints give unique scopes, lasers, body/mag shapes, iron sights, etc. Because from a distance you can't tell the difference between the standard FR and this one if the camo was a similar green."
I'm really happy to see one of the FAMAS Valoris� blueprints be available for everyone to unlock for free. :)
"I have two of em, The Artisan and Fractured Forces. I want Codebreaker but that was in a battlepass"
My most used gun but i'll probably be missing this weapon since I can't seem to get a competent teammate.
That really is the biggest issue with these tournaments! Most used you say.. can I ask what attachments you use
"i hate stacks, can't get over that hump."
It�s a much reduced hump compared to original model
OG m4 next round pleeeeaassseeeee
bad
Wish they gave decent blueprints like the previous spoiled rotten bruen one
"glad to see this isn�t just me, the problem is getting awarded no xp post game or getting a fraction of what you earned?"
"Yup, you also don�t see any XP appear when you get a kill in game. Previously some yellow text popped up like �+100 XP�"
So poor from them! Why fix one and not the other.
"My account was hacked/stolen a week and a half ago. Made a temporary account in the meantime. I was stuck at level 40 (leveled up in Cold War) with level 1 guns until this morning. Now I can level up my guns. However, still no level XP. This game has time and time again bent me over and treated me like a little piggy. I never understood people�s seething hatred towards activision but after experiencing this shit first hand, it�s ungodly. It took me 8 hours to get into a live chat with an agent and they didn�t help me at all. I genuinely wish Activision a terrible morning and I hope they find blood in their stools and lumps on their sternums. I just want to enjoy the game I spent over $100 on (bought the game for last and current gen, and spent money on blueprints/battle pass). Fuck activision and their mothers"
Does your friend own modern warfare? If yes then jump into spec ops and do the Mission Strongbox - and do not cut the door open until your kills stop counting (I do not know how long this takes and if the count stops for everyone) - I did this yesterday with three guys and it was intense - I leveled up with a ton of XP and the weapons I used jumped massively unlocking a ton of attachements
Is anyone else having no kill score appearing on screen?
"Who knows when/if they�ll fix it I don�t believe anyone is getting xp in mp currently, I�d recommend doing plunder or warzone you seem to get xp in that but not in mp unfortunately."
"Vtol, White phos followed by attack helicopter. The rage quit special."
"that's happened a few times and I hear others over the cans ""FUCKING CHEATING BASTARDS"" - I dropped in mid game the one time.. it was me and some REAL low level player playing 2 against 6. we got our asses handed to us but I was working up the Rennec.   


still funny no matter what"
"Lmao that�s my setup, VTOL, White Phosphorus, support helo"

or when you're halfway in to the game and there is a constant chopper
Ask me how much I love using it in Ground War Promenade
"With all due respect because I�m sure you�re a great guy, fuck you."
How much do you love using it in Ground War Promenade?
How much did you love using it in Realism Ground War?
Same reason I use gas and rpg on shipment I'm sure.
"Tbh I really think White phosphorus is meant for Ground War. Smaller maps are just to close and limited visibility, the fuck knows you may be running around in the mist and get shot by a Roze skinned camper camping in dark corner of the fucking room like a little bitch."
You guys are getting kills?
plus its damn war crime...
I think there's a lot about this game that the Geneva Convention would frown upon.
Only reason I�m using it
Even more reason to use it lol
it�s a video game
My issue with it is that I feel that Modern Warfare�s depiction of White Phosphorous really trivializes it. That stuff is no fucking joke and it makes me sick that people can actually use it on each other. Those burns are horrific.
"Eh, countries commit war crimes all the time, why does it matter?"
I love it. Phos on shipment is perfect! If you use it on harcore you're a monster tho.
"if you use it on shipment, I hope both sides of your pillow are warm. I hope you step on a lego too."
You die every time u spawn because you have exceed the limit to kill your teamates
Good old war crimes. I love using it on Shipment in hardcore. The best is if you somehow manage to get a 2nd one
All the teamkills lol
"Someone tried to steal your account and forgot to sign you out, change your email password."
"Password was was changed last night, still the same problem this morning. I just don't understand how this has happened, also doesn't fix the matchmaking issue."
Do u have Damascus? So far I�ve noticed most stolen accounts have this in common
"Yeah I do, the grind was unreal. Just find it weird how I can still log in to the account etc it's like the other person isn't very good at taking over accounts."
"I'll help you 100% if we make a deal

My bad"
"think you're confused mate, I'm from the UK date layout is DD/MM/YY"
"Did you ever resolve this? I had same thing happen. I managed to find the guy on insta and dmed him. Apparently he thought he was buying an account from someone. So apparently my account was hacked and stolen then sold.

Anyway I was able to recover it and change password but his account is still linked and I can't unlink. Still says under review or whatever. And can't find a game stuck at 350 ms like you said.

Tried contacting support but so far no luck"
"Yeah mate, well I say �resolve� I changed the password and set up 2 factor Authentication (also a piss take) and then just kept trying for a week. 

Then, literally a week later I gave it ago expecting the same result and it worked magically.

So the only thing I can suggest is wait mate. I think Activision have a system set up where it detects un-authorised activity and locks it down. If you haven�t done anything wrong you should be fine as it goes through review.

I still can�t remove the rouge account but it hasn�t been a problem as the password change and 2FA make it difficult for them to use it again.

Forget getting in touch with support, they fucking uses less. Their Twitter was replying to people as far back as two months.

Sorry I can�t help further, just wait it out lad best you can do."
"Yeah I've been playing a LOT of Gunfight. I used to love the 6x6 and 10x10 games, but lately it's become a headache to play. Feel like a broken record, but the matchmaking and aim assist in those modes feels broken. Not to mention the camping. Sometimes I just want to get on and shoot something. Gunfight is perfect for that."
yeah gunfight is the best playlist Imo I taught there was so much potential with the game if they got the maps right.
I just stopped playing cod because i had 0 fun only frustrations.
You stopped playing yet you still visit the sub reddit. Seems like it�s hard to give up and maybe not worth it? If you just played the game in a more relaxed manner you might have more fun.
Isn�t he on your team? His name comes up above his head as green
its a yellow colour. my teammate's are blue. idk why some people get red and some get yellow
and if u look at the minimap u can see a red blip at where he's standing
Its a colorblind setting people use to make the game more colorful
Haha! Why didn�t he shoot you?!
Try changing your language on you console rather than MW
"Just the name is wrong, challenge works fine."
"You can still use the rennetti to unlock it, its just a typo thanks to the unreleased sykov"
Yeah got it unlocked. Thanks
Any pistol works
I just unlocked the Skykov last night in mutliplayer yet it's not even out lol. Is it cancelled?
Appearently it�s supposed to be a part of a new season but somehow they were released early. As of now you can only access them by getting them out of the box in survival spec ops
???? It�s easy wym edit: oh I see
Bruh how?

Arther you are not worthy to wield that sword
It would appear that the sword is stuck in the stone your highness.
You win
"You�re able to pick up any paid weapon/skin you find. I think the one in your pic just glitched into the ground when it initially dropped and now it can�t be picked up? I�ve seen it happen with other stuff that�s partially clipped through a wall, it just becomes unlootable."
VORPAL BLADES
The game won't let you pick it up?  That's weird.
[deleted]
The volpol sword from Alice in wonder land
Its the infinity sword from fortnite
Amazing
Looks like it might be the dual swords you can unlock in mw multiplayer just a cosmetic variant. It�s either that or the sword from Cold War.
It�s the vorpal blade from the 16 bit tracer pack in multiplayer
8 pixel
MC meet MW..
It's the sword of a thousand truths
Excalibur

Diamond Sword from Meinkampf
"lol i made a loadout thats just a shield, sword and throwing knife....and i still havent used it. also made an extra stupid one with shield and rpg too. i find its the weird loadouts that you have the most fun tho.

edit: can anyone think of anything more ridiculous than a shield and rpg? any ideas?"
"Just drop the rpg/swords and run around solely with the shield.

Or: take 2 loadouts. But only keep the secondaries. Rpg, swords, throwing knifes and stuns/ smokes. Should be funny to throw a smoke just to smoke the opponent with an rpg."
"My friend downloaded the game again, and it worked."
I've tried that already and it doesn't work either
"My series X has been doing this too, MW, warzone and CW since the update all crash back to the dashboard."
I didnt even know you can still get discs
"Gotta re download the whole game bro, same shit happened to me to."
Did all your unlocks stay or does it wipe everything from multiplayer?
"Are you sure you have downloaded all the needed packs?
Sometimes some packs like data pack 2 or multiplayer 1 are unavailable and you have to search them in shop and add_on part


Also there is no need to download the texture packs they sometimes make your he getting fps drop"
"As a sweaty player, I can confirm lobbies have gone full tilt recently.

Every match is a CDL final."
Noticed this too.... is Activision shadowbanning from WZ over to our MW???
Could be that most casuals and noobs migrated over to cold war. Now we're left with the sweats going for obsidian.
"Yeah I did a thread on this on Thursday, someone else did a thread on this yesterday. Something happened. Like the matchmaking got tightened up or something. Or like others have said, the casuals are on Cold War, and we're stuck with the die-hards. Or the people tired of the SBMM in CW have come back to MW. I don't know, but something definitely changed in the past couple of weeks. Seemed like it happened when ranked mode was implemented in CW."
"Yes me too, the game is full of sweats. I'm bad but I'm getting destroyed all the time. According to what people say on this sub about SBMM I should eventually end up playing against bots, but nope. Yesterday I had a lobby full of lvl 1055 (max lvl I guess?) in S&D. Not fun at all."
normally ive realized that once shoot the ship isnt in rotation all the sweats move over to core playlists which results in ahrder lobbies
"Same. I stopped playing after getting shit on non-stop last week. Nothing but super sweaty players. I�m a more casual player, and it�s just not fun anymore."
"Uhm nope, weekly kd is still above 5, everything's looking normal"

Some people have to leave their mom�s basement every once in awhile.
"Mp5 is best sub, most people run merc forgrip, monolithic integral barrel, 45 rnd mag, stippled grip, then a laser, fast ads stock or sleight of hand.

Also give the uzi a go, it's  a great fun gun. Slower fire but higher damage, can get some picks at crazy ranges. It's only good once you unlock the ammo conversion though.

Kar98 is beat marksman / sniper. But spr also very good and better for longer range.

Kilo is very accurate and great for mid to long ranges.

MP4 is a great all round ar. But don't use the silenced barrel it's bugged.

As-val is meta for FFA, TDM as it's ttk is crazy. If you can handle the recoil and small mag size.

Oden is also a great fun gun"
Woah thanks for the in-depth response dude much appreciated
Good. Now enable two-step authentication since your account will be targeted by hackers.
Wtf?!
"Curious is your rank levelling up and are you receiving xp and battle pass rewards ? ,"
im also having a bug were i cant level up because of the update
"well don�t expect to ever see those points again. they played you and they don�t fucking care. they got your money, that�s all they want. they don�t give a shit if you�re happy."
Not alone on the tiers.....kinda sucks
Same shit happen to me
"Same crap happened to me just now. I haven't been able to play for a while, but wanted the Battle Pass stuff. It said (with the sale) that it'd cost me 3700 points to get to Tier 100. I had 100 points so bought $40 worth to get me to 5100. I bought the tiers and now only have 50 points left."
"""Da fak is goin over der"""
Lmao that�s probably the funniest MW clip I�ve ever seen
Glad u enjoyed it. We laughed our asses off
This is prolly the funniest shit I�ve seen in modern warfare for a long time
That was beautiful...

Thanks b
That was a 540 righ'?
Yeah. He did a full turn and a half
"Fue m�s de 360 XD
Al chile est� bien vergas"
I used to be a soldier like you... then I took a throwing knife to the knee...
Clean up on isle 9 was one of my favorite play lists and idk why. I miss it alot
Close shave too. Hit his heel! Nice hit man!
Never understood in COD why a knife to the leg was an auto-kill. Nice shot though!
Dude...nice
"I don't understand their language, but I know exactly what they said at the end."

"I love MW Remaster, most of it feels exactly like the original but looks better. But I mostly play MW19 because of stuff like the Gunfight Tournaments and all of it still feels a little newer, less familiar than MWR. But sometimes I miss the more arcady, more casual gameplay of MWR, that's when I sometimes switch. They feel pretty different from one another. MW19 is the harder game to play. Both are fun in their way."
"So me and my friend used to do weekends where we'd just play splitscreen CoD almost non-stop (Ghosts, MW3, BO2), and we always had a blast. Unfortunately I got a long streak of work and then the pandemic hit, so we haven't been able to do those in a while.

MW19 local multiplayer is pretty fun if you ask me (you have a bit more custom game options than Ghosts, and the class customization focuses mostly on the new gunsmith system which I prefer over the old system. The maps are also less cancer when play), even if I had to use my little brother as a substitute for my friend when I played it."
Modern Warfare reflex edition is the best cod ever made
Wow didn�t even realize this existed
"&#x200B;

Hello,  I'm a battlefieldV player who has had enought of the hackfest BF5 has  become lately with all servers infested with hackers, making the game  unplayable. So i'm considering changing games. I know CoD unlike BF5 in  many ways considering its an arcade type FPS, so thats a drawback for  me, but i've heard there is a mode in modernwarfare, Ground Wars that  ends up being very similar to BF type of gameplay. What can you guys  tell me about it? Are the servers populated, is it a dead game mode? How  about cheaters? I'm considered other games like tarkov, insurgency  sandstorm, or squad2. But they are wither dead, full of cheaters of  outdated im graphics.

thanks in advance"
"Download warzone, it runs on the same engine and uses the same assets as MW. Still very popular and free to play without buying MW. If you like the feel of warzone, you'll probably like MW."
"MW19, MW remastered only has campaign"
that�s mw2 remastered the first one does have multiplayer
"Stop crying and move on bro, they don�t care"
It's the Grau with the Archangel barrel
That there sir is a fart gun the exact same model as the one used in despicable me
grau 556
Garu with other barrel besides arc.
That sir is the strela
"That there is an m3 grease gun, prominently used in WWII"
Grau 5.56 challenge is to get 5 kills in a minute 25 times
if you mean in real life it�s based on the SG550 series of rifles
"Summary:
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were 
already dead.


In all seriousness last frame you shave his ear."
"Because you miss him. Shot hits to the left. 

Edit- check last frame of second 6."
"Inbox it me if you can, it has to best haircut I�ve give someone"
Very last frame in shot. Just to the left of the head.
You flicked too much left/latency. There�s your professional answer
Sbmm lowered your aim assist
Sbmm made my shot not register:/
"Taking latency into account and how the servers are, combined with your flick speed, im gonna say you missed him to the left more than you realized. On your screen it looked dead on but I'm gonna bet on his screen it just veered to his right and didn't phase him too much."
"Sick plays! And super sick knife flick. Also good to see some M13 use!  

And happy cake day!"
"Thanks - always loved that gun. Trying to get it to Obsidian hence the speed build. 

I didn�t even realise it was my CD - thank you!"
Question: Is this an old clip? Does the bug already rid off? Why I cannot up my progression and weapon upgrade points?
"All great questions. Not that old, about 3 weeks?"
That throwing knife is so sick. And btw is the m13 bettet in HC mode? Im trying to get obsedian
Thank you. I find it pretty good for the Shoot The Ship playlist with it built for speed rather than accuracy. Trying to get it to obsidian too.
Must... get... dopamine...
So this is the power of ultra instinct?
This is true and has sadly always been the case for co-op modes. Whereas a single Plunder match (30min max) would also net you 1.5 Tier progression (without the double XP)
I�m only playing on the series s :(
Yes you are clearly hacking bruh. /s
Nice hacks
"What's the current and planned clan tag?

Shit like ""BLDM"" and ""CUM"" are present in the game lol"
current is \[Sqnch\] and i've put things in like \[yes\] \[no\] \[hello\] \[safe\] \[nice\] etc... nothing works

Ok thank you
Its a bug try doing some in warzone they worked for me on some
"That�s the problem. The first challenge for Gaz is to win 3 gulag matches. I�ve won a couple by putting myself in the gulag purposefully, but they aren�t tracking still."
They are glitched you need to own the skin to do the challenges. They aren�t going to track otherwise it�s just a visual glitch that makes the challenge appear.
There seem to be 2 new Bundles in the Store with the Base Skins for the Operators with the new Missions - if you buy those i guess they will track. (I did not buy them so i am only guessing)
"Yeah, having the same issue, I've been trying to do Rodion and Bale's challenges, they just aren't tracking in Warzone and MP, I'm assuming it's just another bug like the XP stuff right now"
I�m hoping so. I do want those skins!
[deleted]
"Same here. None of the challenges for any of the operator skins are tracking for me, and I�ve already tried several. Not sure if this is a bug, or the skins were released by accident? Or what"
yup. happening to me in FFA lobbies constantly. it gets me killed sometimes cuz i'm just standing there like an idiot waiting for it to unfreeze.
"Yeah, I have this same thing happening every 1-2 respawns, super annoying"
Jeez lol. I just got my pc on Monday and I was like wow... this things messed up already lol. Hopefully this is fixed soon. MW is the superior game rn over CW and they can�t even have it run smoothly
"You shouldn't need to dl HD textures or the CW data pack. MW is now basically just a paid DLC to Warzone though, instead of WZ being a free DLC to MW. E: Oh well, at least it would barely reduce the file size even if you could remove WZ, since almost all of it is reused assets from MW Ground War and Spec Ops."
thanks bro! so i just need to download all the stuff for campaign multiplayer and coop. Lol Looks like another 15 hours baby letsss gooooo i love activision
Nice count me it. Also Rumble was 64v64 at some points
"Server browser? I mean I love the idea but you�re thinking of bettlefield. I don�t think call of duty has ever had a server browser, so it may never get one. I�d be down tho"
I still get no XP for rank
Same here.
"�Credit where credit is due� is normally not a phrase associated with fucking millions of people for over a week then fixing something you fucked up back to how it was originally. It�s normally used in reference to progress or an accomplishment. But thank you for the post updating on the XP fix, I wasn�t turning the game on again until they fixed it."
"OP used ""credit where credit is due"" because they're a group of small indie developers who managed to fix the bugs so quickly despite a global pandemic. Kudos to Activision!"
Most of the other data packs are what is taking up that space
maybe you have clutter and redundant system files. Try Windows Clean Up utility with admin rights
Tbh just turn down the quality for everything
"im on a 1070, and i have everything turned down to low, what is your cpu and ram?"
Make sure to keep everything turned low or medium. Also make sure your render resolution is set correctly too.
"Watch [this video ](https://youtu.be/YAx3BQwrl50) 

He�ll explain what everything does, how it impacts the game and what he recommends for a good mix of performance & visual aesthetic"
"Upvoted, this seemed to help. Thanks."
"Don�t worry. 

With the last update fixing XP and hitmarkers issue, they only not fixed camos progression, they fucked the performance.  
Mine is locked on 63 fps instead almost constant 100 fps."
"this should be a thing when using the grenadier or corvus barrel since those have barrel mounted, non removable sights"
There are some guns with a mix sights  (don�t remember) which have the front sight appearing in the front
True but I wish all of them had an option to keep the front sights. Probably won�t happen though which is sad but I�ll keep hoping!
This is pubg
Yep I just wanted to show you a visual example of what it looks like lol
"Having the option to co witness iron sights with optic attachments would be nice, I agree!"
nice
I can confirm you were hijacked. They unlinked ur activision acc from ur console and that�s why now u have a new acc that�s brand new. This happened to me they stole my Damascus and when I finally got it back they had the audacity to message me �how u get ur cod account back�. They may have also hacked into your email so u need to change that password
"You were hacked, contact activision support and file a recovery form"
Thank you! I can�t believe that people are pathetic enough to hack other peoples accounts like that
Same thing happening to me on Sunday dude. File an account recovery report and hound them on live chat. Luckily I managed to get through to them after 15 mins but I�ve heard people have been waiting upwards of an hour to speak to someone. Unfortunately it�s one of those situations where they won�t really do much unless you�re persistent. Also make sure you�ve got some sort of evidence of the account being yours. With Xbox I collected screenshots and game clips of me getting Damascus etc to help verify should they need it! Good luck man
Thank you guys for the info and advice! It�s pretty pathetic that people have the audacity to do this shit. We�re just trying to play and have fun yet they feel like they need to rob people of their enjoyment just because they�ve realized how badly they drag down the human race�s progression
They�re losers who get joy from stealing
"If you�re a big warzone player, I think it�s a no-brainer. You can level up weapons sooo much faster that way. While I mostly play Cold War, MW doesn�t feel outdated, since it�s still a different gameplay experience"
"Warzone? No I don't play that anymore. I hardly get any kill there. I'm concerned about the player base of MW, as it being almost about 2 year old, don't know how long will it sustain it's player base."
"Still play it and prefer it 10 times over Cold War which is ass.  Sincerely, neck beard"
"Yep, i bought it a month ago and for me is very good"
Hellll yahh
"I buyed it today. I played mw on ps4 almost one year. I wanted to try play warzone on MaK but I've got destroyed everytime. So I started playing on MaK today and I love it. You've got so many benefits aganist ps4. More fps, game filters but most importantly for me.... finally FOV 120!!! I'm not playing with glasses anymore! And I just love it. I think mw is really worth it in 2021."
I am still playing and enjoying it.
Incoming neckbeard comments about how cold war is ass
"I would say not to buy it until the xp glitch is 100% fixed, otherwise its a fine game. But whatever you do, do not play 6v6 respawn modes in that game. They play like shit. Everybody camps."
Cold war multi-player is complete dog poo poo. Campaign and zombies Gucci tho
Cold War IS ass. Anyone who thinks CW is an example of a good Call of Duty game has standards lower than the Marianas Trench.
I have fun with friends still. I don�t enjoy joining random ctf lobbies by myself
"Depends on how much you think you'll play.  Overall a discount is always nice.  It's not a bad game, but it's a online service.  Anytime they feel like it they can make the game unplayable."
"This has happened to a youtuber named Smii7y, you can use it to see through stairs haha. Just reboot the game"
Did u lag really badly cuz that's happened to me
Everyone's having an XP problem.
thanks
Yeah it�s happening to me as well. For some reason I either gain 0xp or 300-500xp even when I get 20+ kills. It�s annoying
"Yeah this is a know glitch and it's happening to everyone, no xp for no one sorry bro"
"i gotchu, any idea why my voice chat isn�t working on CW? hasn�t since i bought the game the day of the release"
well but why everyone is saying that got fixed when I have the same problems?
Took my PS4 about 10-15 hrs to install the entire game. Just a heads up
"yo dude, im actually trying to play the game or something. but i have to install all these data packs or some shit. i downloaded the one for survival and it finished. but now i dont know how to actually play. like its not letting me get past the data packs screen. do i have to download allllll of them to play the game?????"
At least on Xbox you can download exactly what you want at the priority you want

Yup same
Same
Same.  Just played Ground War.  No points.  No XP in Rumble either although I do get weapon XP.
I get weapon XP and battle pass progression but that�s it
"I'm getting weapon XP now. My prestige level is going up after every round, too. But, something is still not correct with soldier rank.  I have all 1-55 unlocks since immediately after installing MW. But when I'm in-game my rank is stuck at Recruit with the single-chevron icon and it never changes. I assume I have all the soldier rank unlocks because of my prior progression in BOCW.

I have already completed season 1 battle pass on BOCW before purchasing MW last week. So, no way to know if that is working or not."
Update: Ok I restarted my ps5 and now everything is tracking as normal.
I don�t have XP either
"**xp either, i don�t have.** 

*-thatsgiacomo*

***



^(Commands: 'opt out', 'opt in', 'delete')"
Yeah i�m having the same problem
*MW games NO XP. CW games YES XP*..... feels like this was a commit before the shits went home for the weekend
Still got no XP aftergamesin multiplayer..
"No gun XP, no soldier XP, and aim assist barely kicks in at all. It's either not working or its weak as fuck. Cause I can't sweep my shots like I used to. Overshooting every single time"
Yea the same thing is happening to me now. It�s crazy... like one game I�ll get 100 xp for going 30 and 5 and the next game will track properly but even that doesn�t give me normal xp. Another issue is that my reticle challenges aren�t tracking at all
Fixed for me. All my weapons are gaining multiple levels per match.
"To be fair, what's the point of playing with just 3 different guns? I mean, having to experiment with different guns and attachments is important, at least for me, in making the longevity of a game. For instance lately I found out that a PKP + any SMG Loadout works great for me, the first is hella accourate and it's something nobody really uses, making it twice as satisfying"
R/ Warzone
Sure?
Shit i want to use other guns but I can't leave the AMAX/MAC10
They're very solid in almost every gun fight.
This is how you make billions...and HATE your customers at the same time!
i get that all the time on xbox lol
Ps5 here .. same.
Don�t forget random graphics settings resetting to default for no apparent reason
Console deals with that too lol me and my console friends get that almost every day but the update is only a few seconds
Every other day it's a random tiny ass update.  It's annoying afffff
DONT FORGET SERVER QUES AS WELL FOR BATTLE.NET
"Anybody else who deals with shaders for MP always installing? Or those, what I call �mini� 240mb updates, we get every week or so? Or is this just me? PC btw, not console"
Was someone knocking on your door or it�s you hitting the desk out of laughter? Cuz pretty sure I�d have lost my shit if this happen to me lol.
"Me hitting my desk out of laughter lol maybe a bit of anger for the guy in the clip as well since he killed me and I was somewhat timid he picked up my specialist bonus just to get clowned on, weird how he was knocked though with EOD had to have been a direct impact"
"Yeah your account got hacked and taken. Normally in the past it would be hard to get back, but I hear now that they actually care and have been returning some."
I had it happen with the harpy. It was weird
"Yea, it almost looks like a ripple."
There's a white blip when you switch/pick up weapons yeah. Like a ghostly flashlight for one sec
"Thankyou pal, been bugging me like mad that explains it"
"its your crosshairs loading in, just like how your reticle from your optic also loads in. somehow they havent fixed it yet, has me wondering if they even test their game before patching"
"For real, they managed to ONLY fix hitmarkers and not the other issues. Are they even aware of them???"
"I'm not even getting aim assist. That update did something to it cause it kicks in and sometimes it doesn't. I always quickscope, you rely on that aim assist to know when to pull the trigger when you sweep your shot, and most of the time I miss it, muscle memory just tells you it's all wrong"
"I'm getting this too, and seeing very little about it online. I wonder do they even realise this is a bug..."
Not likely. Hackers hardly get banned when they�re doing it clear as day. Doubt you�ll get the hammer over a few trash players. Hell you drop 50 kills in multiplayer with maybe 10 deaths. �You�re a hacker�. Or maybe you get that one guy who thinks cause he�s moving he can�t get head shotted by a sniper with one shot �You�re hackinggg�. I�d of gone through like 5 accounts by now by the lame people who think you�re hacking just cause you have more game sense report you.
Well if you were to Get banned it would start with a 7 day shadow ban and then they would run the files during your previous play periods if its clean your good if they find something you get a permanent ban.
thanks
"This game wont die unless the only playlist available is grazna raid and azhaie cave 24/7 . 
It doesn't matter what they do to it, its so much better than cold war so... Game aint dying soon"
Could not have said it better myself.
If grazna raid was 12v12 that would be okay probably. It�s a decent map for big team battle. 6v6 is camper city though.
It's like an Android phone that's no longer receiving software updates
It�s worse than that they�re updating the game with bugs intentionally so you can buy blackcocks
"I do not know if anyone else has this issue, but I do not receive exp or gun exp after every single match I play."
It looks like it's fixed and they're giving double weapon exp.
"I bought cod mw last week. There is never a problem finding a game, even when i have the filter to only play domination. Lots of low rank players still. The cross platform play is good, xbox and pc players play together so long as the controllers are the same."
"You should typically still find a game even after a year or two from the games release, as you do with most cods. I mean, I can still find games for BO4, Infinite Warfare, WWII"
If you want to play multiplayer you should probably wait till the weapon exp bug is fixed. It's a lot of fun when the game is working and I'd expect there to be a solid player base for the whole next cycle since a lot of players prefer it over cold war.
Buy it. People  still play this game(like me) . Cross play came through
Having the same problem. Keeps trying to connect but can�t
"Now it can connect, but I can't finish a game. It'll lag me out. It's been like this for at least 3 days."
"if memory serves well.. maybe i've seen this before in this sub..

is this a repost?"
"Indeed it is. Trying to figure out if this did well last time because of timing or content.. Heli snipes aren�t terribly hard, but posting others hasn�t gained the same support.... Kinda just venting thoughts at this point"
"This happened to me a few weeks after the game launched, I was so tilted at the time I�d been playing for hours an then got sniped out a heli, my pad went up the wall so hard the triggers came out"
Helis take you one place.. da fuckin ground. Sorry bro
It�s a Fr.556 Blueprint that�s guess what (In MW)
"No it is not. The FFAR and FR. 556 look similar, but it is an FFAR. [Image Link](https://imgur.com/a/S7EMl5f)"
Dude it�s a fr556 blueprint are you dumb
"I'm not dumb, that's why I said it is an [FFAR](https://imgur.com/a/S7EMl5f)."
chronicles weapons more loot box items
"You knew that the content was just gonna last a year when you bought the game, so why are you surprised when they stop most of the content? Some of the best cods in history stopped after a year to make way to the new cod, why should it be different this time?"
actually there have been multiple cods that produced content after the next one came actually mw would be the only one not too since bo3 they just money hungry and forcing people to buy cold war so they don't care what happens
bo3 alone would like a word that game carried the franchise for damn near 2 years off zombies alone
thats a whole nother level of cap considering the cold war mp5 isn't even viable on warzone compared to mws and modern warfares highest ttk fully auto is the as val hands down being able to kill and two shots mac 10 in cold war close range there literally is no out gunning unless you snipe them which is like a 20% chance of being successful considering hit markers flinch and other variables thats why its the most used gun in warzone right now you literally won't have a game where you see no one running it
Stop whining tons of people still play modern warfare it will be several years before people abandon it and of course there gonna focus more on the new cod that's how its always been weather you like it or not
they're worked on my 2 different companies only one pubublishes in just too busy working on mw2 to gaf
"They should focus on MW and CW, and CW content should stay in CW."
"Nice Warzone gameplay in a MW sub, great job reading the sub name"

My guess goes for coincidence.
"Until the update that happened a few hours ago I think everyone was having super laggy multiplayer games, I had the same issue and after this past update I�ve noticed that it has been a lot less laggy. Hope this helps."
"Ok, thanks for the info!"
He's a CSGO pro
Cods fortnite now.
"you didnt play against bots, you played against aimbots"
Lol
 the first one you hit on hackney was kinda satisfying
Thanks yeah I just jumped after the second shot and happened to see him on the way down. I was really hype when I hit it haha I just edited it out
"damn, how many throwing knife kills you have?"
"Haha kind of a lot actually, I love the throwing knife. The full video has some more, but I didn�t even put all of them in because it�s already a long compilation. Here�s the link if you want to see more

 https://youtu.be/LHSEZlvp_ak"
Gotta love a good unexpected knife kill might switch out my semtex for the knife
I love the knife dude you can get awesome kills with it. Plus it comes through clutch sometimes as a last ditch effort if you�re about to die. Put that knife back on!

"Can you clarify on what ""playing like this"" means?"
[removed]
Sounds like you're hating. When I hit that jump shot after that guy got a hitmarker on me I wallbanged someone then quick scope for final kill. Before commenting something toxic you should post footage of you hitting what you believe to be crazy shots.

It�s like I�m matched with sweats on the opposing team but I�m on a team with absolute bots
"Don't know about you, for me it has been this way since day one. It actually looks like IW made a casting to make sure I get the most demented team out there XD"
Exactly. It's super weird everytime.
Yeah I did a thread on the same subject last night. Game has become stressful all of a sudden. Happened overnight like a switch got flipped.
It's so annoying. There was something similar a couple months back. I only played against sweats. I think their matchmaking is fucked.
It'll happen as the player pool gets lower.
the player pool is shrinking as activision strangles the life out of the game
"no. they are doing zero XP events though, and for an entire week not just the weekend, so there's that."
"Actually a fucking joke that MW players had a zero xp bug for an entire WEEK, and then the day it gets fixed they enable double xp....... for only Cold War and Warzone. 

Absolute state"
Did they fix it yet?
I checked down detector and it looks like most of the servers in  NE US are down. Changing my internet isn�t working either. Error code 4
All I see with that skin is a militarized 50 Cent from Bulletproof.
"it's just Activision. they don't care, even if cold war isn't the best thing
I still believe that yearly releases are a cancer"
Activision has relationship issues. Never wants to settle down. Lol
"That being said, they are kind enough to fix whenever the screw up, It might take a while \*cough\* Almost a week with hitbox errors, no xp and what not \*cough\* but they eventually got shit done. Gotta give them kudos for that much at least. They might not be as efficient, but they're at least trying."
Even though they never acknowledged that MW had said issues.. just Warzone.
"I do really well with it using overkill with an AR, on the 10v10 moshpit playlist. This is my loadout I use with a longrange AMAX

https://i.imgur.com/Ozwbtoe.png

The ""sweet spot"" is inside any building"
"Dam thanks man, also I meant the sweet spot for the rpg and taking down uav�s hahaha"
I swear the R9 is built for 10v10 HQ. Had some crazy multikills with it
Extend the pellet spread as far as possible and aim
"the tip for the rpg is ti never shoot UAVs, its too hard to hit them so you waste a rocket when it could be used to hit a CUAV or a personal UAV"
Alright thanks for the tip
"Some others already have the CUAV stuff and all, for an R9-O I'd use it with an SMG or AR, and use it close-quarters with long range or very fast speed. IMO since I've seen it in circulation a lot recently I'd recommend the inner parts of Suldal Harbor, take on window sitters if you can, and stick to the freezer, office, and cargo area for the R9-O, you can also go for longshots in those lines-of-sight in that same area"
This is the wrong subreddit but it�s a cool post nonetheless
"Still technically ""Modern warfare"""
"All credit to the insane player BeRRYcod4.
Clip from his video https://youtu.be/hz_rvG-ooLI
Honestly a must watch if you loved COD4. BeRRY is the master of the bounce."
Core for sure. In Hardcore you can just camp somewhere and get a one shot kill with almost any weapon in the game.
People only touch hardcore for camos and then once they�re done they�re done with hardcore
"the only thing that takes skill in hardcore is playing aggressively, because most of the enemy is camping in dark corners or windows with one shot weapons"
"Core. Takes reaction and aiming skill. Hardcore you can just spray and pray. Friend only plays HC, his reaction time is great but cant aim for shit. I'm the opposite."
"Yup, agree. Weapon dexterity is a must in core."
Hardcore doesn�t take skill whatsoever.
"Both are skillful in their own way. I play both and change back-and-forth without any problem.

* Core gives you plenty of time to react but you have to keep your aim on target, first shot accuracy is not important as you have time to correct. Core is overall more friendly towards player. But weapon balance only revolves around M4, MP5, R9-0, Val, SPR and it boring at times. But at least I acknowledge that it�s more fun for the majority of player as people hate dying to one shot weapon and everything is one shot in HC, maybe because people like you see it as unfair �hey I didn�t even have the time to shoot him, broken ass game� when in reality you got out-sped by miles.

* Hardcore doesn�t give you enough time to react but it gives you the damage a real bullet would deal to an infranty soldier. Imma have to debunk you here, my accuracy actually improves with HC. Since you have such a short window of time to react to an enemy in a 1 on 1 situation, you have to hit those shots accurately or you will die. That is taking in Spint-to-Fire time, the time it takes for you to correctly point your crosshair at the enemy, ADS time, your mouse response rate and latency compare to your monitor,... and weapon choice and customization is better, I�d argue that GunSmith is made for HC because every weapon and every build can work well. My AR doesn�t have to look and play like an SMG anymore with those No Stock yet I can still shit on people. Good luck beating an M4 with the SCAR in Core.

I�m pretty sure your friend is just trash and the only HC game you ever played on was Shipment to have that kind of notion about HC. It�s just the freaking 30HP, the mini-map and no hud. I�m no camper but you got killed by campers because you play it like you play Core. You play it like you have 100HP, running around like head-less chickens, jumping and dropshotting like idiots and name-calling anyone who kill you whenever they carefully peak a corner and burst you balls. It�s not about camping, it�s about playing it medithodically. If you can�t handle it, then back out for core maybe? I bet you don�t even have a a good reason to bash HC other than �oH 2oo m4nY c4mp3rS�"
Thank you. I mean not to be that guy by any means cuz I fully support girl gamers but damn.. every hardcore lobby has a girl squad lol
"HC forces you to be more mindful of your surroundings/situation since you cant regenerate or take make much damage. Its more cerebral in that you have to pick and choose more carefully in how to traverse a map. Meaning you need a good understanding of the layout and how your enemies will use this to their advantage. Its much harder to find people too because you dont have access to mini map or killcams. It's actually far more impressive to rush successfully in HC since that requires both fast reaction speeds and knowledge.

Core is difficult because everyone has access to the same arsenal. But unlike in HC, its easier to use these to their full potential. Things like strafe speed and a number of perks actually matter. That means your opponents are going to be more difficult to fight. Basically it takes less skill, but the ""difficulty"" of your opponents goes up with it

Overall, I think HC is actually more difficult, but its also really fucking boring. People who say Core usually dont want to admit that they cant rush like they do im HC. Youre really not supposed to. Which is why its so much more impressive if you can. Unless its Grazna Raid. That requires godly patience and will power to not punch your screen out of boredom."
"Great reply, thank you for sharing. I agree with the map knowledge part forsure but that's where most HC games turn into camp fests (for me atleast) and always having daddy acti dicking you down with sbmm makes it worse."
I have felt this and it's nowhere to be found on the entire internet.
I think the devs are trying to make it harder to abuse aim assist using controller adapters/XIM style devices.
So normal players get fucked in the ass because of POS cheaters. Great.
No joke this week has been my worst week. I usually score in the top three of all my multiplayer games. This week with my Grau rifle i had the worst games ever. I knew something was off it has to be the aim assist.
Those xim/cronus cheats fucked you guys.
jokes on you i use controller but at the same time disable aim assist
Aim assist has always been a close range thing.
"Only rotating on passing enemies was a close range thing, not the assist slowdown when you point at soldier."
there are people who actually play ctf?
"Probably the dying playerbase

In my experience CTF has always been a sweat fest, but that's because I always get matched against premades in the few times I've played it

CTF in BO1 was the best, sweaty as hell but so much fun. Never really enjoyed it since then."
"Having ""Code Breaker"" blueprint, not worths the grind."
"Sadly I don't have that one, however in principle I agree; Code Breaker is the one Valoris� blueprint that's superior to The Fallen out of the options in the game.

Code Breaker is actually the **only** Valoris� built on the ""real""/base-gun body, as opposed to the ""fictionalized""/Anomaly body. Though The Fallen does have the ""real"" pistol grip and trigger guard (just not the rest of the body)."
i also have that one but i just like collecting blueprints >:)
"[Link to its COD Tracker page](https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/990-the-fallen). Really nice to see one of the Valoris� blueprints available for free to everyone, and especially so with this one, as The Fallen is arguably the most ""normal"" looking of all the ones in the game. :)"
"Got to the semis last night. I'm not real big on the camos and grinding, but I kinda want that prize."
Sorry but what�s a Valorise blueprint?
Why do people call it valorise?
Is the first Gunfight Tournament since October?
Looks like bocw famas
"That's because both are based on the same gun, the FAMAS Valoris�."
"Was it worth it? I�m just awful at Gunfight and don�t want to put the effort into it... If it was Capture the Flag, then I might�ve given the tournament a go."
"Fuck I forgot I put that note on my profile, don�t mind the edginess"
"You can't do anything about it. It's ACTV's community and the shareholders get to (inadvertently) call the shots and take none of the blame. And since the CoD community seems to like being taken advantage of, you can't fix the corporate greed. CoD's a sinking ship, nothing can be done to fix it."
"There is some thing you can do. 

we are still the ones with all the money.

if we STOP buying shit. they will give us what we want. and not what they THINK we want."
"Same thing happened to me just now. I've been playing since it came out and sent a fair amount of money on it.
I submitted an account recovery ticket through activision. Hope they get back to me soon..."
"Same thing here, btw how did you submitted the account recovery ticket? Please help"
"Happened to me when I played the Cold War beta. It said I had to link my activision account and BOOM reset. All my camos gone, all my progress in each season gone. Contacted them via text but they are useless. Haven�t gotten my stuff back. 

I guess I�ll try again soon"
I'll friend you in a sec
"I am, when are you on?"
"I�m on rn, want to play?"
I�ll play again tomorrow. Already won it once today because my dumb ass thought the reward was a ram7 blueprint but it�s the famas.
Do you have a pic of the blueprint? I actually really like the famas and want to see if it looks cool
"No one is receiving XP currently after the last update. Some got an update today that fixed it, most didn't. It's all this sub has been about for the last week lol"
"Ohh loool didn�t even realize.
Thanks mate and sorry for being that guy haha"
The thing is that I�m playing with my friends and they are ranking
I will still report just in case.
Nice.
Dope shit!
Does anyone know how to fix the matchmaking error in gunfight tournament?

"Playing with a 1080p TV that doesn't support HDR, still crashing for me"
"It does? Damn, really thought I was onto something here as it seemed to work fine ever since I turned it off...
Just out of curiousity,  and assuming you're on ps4 as well, when you go to display settings from the ps4 menu, is HDR set to automatic or off?"
Is this still working for you?  We've been dealing with these split screen crashes all week.
"I haven't played since yesterday evening. Doing some cleaning around the house today, but it hasn't crashed once for us since we turned off HDR when we played last night (for a good 3 hours or so).

Make sure to turn it off from the playstation settings menu, sound and screen. Let me know how it works out for you, and happy gaming!"
"Weird, I tried this but it didn�t work. Loads up the game, let�s me and my gf sign in, finds a game then crashes when the match starts loading. So annoying.

Edit: I change some more settings in the video and audio area, got a couple matches played and then it crashed again with split screen. So odd."
"Just out of curiousity, have you also restarted the ps4? I'm on a ps4 slim, so it's maxed out at 1080p. If you have a pro, you could try to set it to 1080p for the time being, at least until they release a proper patch"
Would have been better if you died to it
Ohhhhh my gawwwwdddddd people get a fucking life.
"For actual interactions, or usernames, sure, ban them, that�s fine. But for class names or weapon names? Nah. You control that 100%, and only you see it. I don�t think it�s an issue."
I�m pretty sure they have more important things to fix out
You people really need to stop being sensitive over tiny things
I�m not I�m just pointing this out I�m pretty sure you can do this with your name too
nice bait troll
Idk what you mean by bait but ok not my intention at all
Btw I was just pointing this out not need to be toxic about this like I said to another person in here I�m pretty sure you can do this with your name now chill out
"Dude you wouldn't have survived mw2 lobbies. If the remaster ever comes out, do yourself a favor and just dont play it."
"Can we stop posting this cringe shit? Stop acting like you�re a fucking war vet for playing a video game. I played the game, it�s wasn�t that hardcore.

For anybody who wants to know what MW2 lobby�s were like, I�ll tell ya: 12 years olds singing Eminem songs and your mom jokes, and maybe someone calls you the n word. There you go. That�s it."
Boo hoo
Do you have it in gold?
I don�t think anyone has the FR 5.56 gold unless for Damascus
"I have it, soon i will put it here and nark you"
That looks like the FFAR
Yep copying CW HW
Fyi it looks really cool when it has platinum on it
are the iron sight changed?
"Nope, it's the same one from tge base variant"
Can you still get it or is it too late?
"It still up, you can earn it"
"I always assumed the melee hits were head blows that are on the level of causing concussions to full blown death. 

I can�t say dick about the shotgun pellets, they are underpowered by mechanic: every 2 pellets grants bonus damage, so those distance shots where you�re hitting 1 maybe 2 pellets does jack shit."
"If you got rocked in the head with a pistol by a dude like Minotaur you would prolly be out of commission pretty damn quick my dude. But no it�s not realistic. No COD ever has been, but melee has to be viable in some circumstances."
Nah it�s jus how they can lunge across the room taking bullets to their face and still be able to slap you twice
Sounds like you would enjoy Hardcore. Too bad no such option exists for WZ.
"There was a hardcore br mode once, snipers were obviously op"
"That'd be interesting, I wonder how it'd play."
"Obviously never played older CODs where the melee was one hit kill, and in the MW2 days you could commando lunge through bullets. Its not realistic buts its a game? All this rubbish about realism is hilarious"
Most of these posts are made by kids that have a 0.3kd and blame any game mechanic besides themselves. Same with people complaining about jump or drop shotting.
I guarantee that if I cracked you in the jaw with 2 lbs of polymer & steel your teeth would gone.
"I guarantee if I shot u in the face with a shotgun u would die immediately, LET ALONE LUNGE ACROSS THE ROOM TO SLAP ME IN THE FACE WHILE TAKNG FURTHER PELLETS INTO UR NECK AND BODY"
"Tbh I see why people get mad if they get two tapped by someone punching them out with their handgun and can�t do the same with like two headshots.  But they already nerfed melee a little bit and it sucks now. Any time I�m in a situation of 3+ people, even if I knock them all. I run out of ammo in both guns and before I can reload that last guy always comes out. And I can nearly never win by using melee with my guns anymore, even if I�m reacting and moving first. It used to feel more fair but now it just feels like theres no point to it unless you�re just hitting someone that�s a bot. (And also, were playing a game with characters that are supposed to be top tier military professionals, it should be common knowledge for them to know how to knock you tf out in just one hit to the jaw, especially with a weapon in hand. JS)"
I mean top tier military professionals that can barely scale a 45cm rock
No one tell this guy about throwing knives one hitting in the toe. He might have a stroke.
play hardcore you numnut
"This is cod, not tarkov.

Cod has never been realistically acurate. If that�s what you are looking for go check out escape from tarkov. After a few raids you will probably gladly come back to the simplicity and inaccuracy of cod.

You can ask why a Prius isn�t a corvette, but in the end it�s not and never will be."
Ever seen someone get pistol whipped? They rarely stay standing after the first hit
Ever seen someone get shot in the face? I haven�t but i would assume they would no longer be around - you know considering that is the sole purpose of the gun...
"**MW2:** first COD, that I got when I was 10. Absolutely loved it, but I didn't play multiplayer that much. Spec ops and campaign were incredible. **Rating: 9.5**

**BO1:** Best maps imo. Got the most prestiges on this game (7) and I had amazing time. Had great party modes. **Rating: 9**

**MW3:** Very solid game. ACR suppressor was a bit over used for the whole time, but I enjoyed every aspect of this game. **Rating: 8.9**

**BO2:** I didn't own this game, but I played it a lot with my friends. Loved the zombies. **Rating: 8.5**

**Ghost & AW:** Didn't really play either of these games. Common consensus was that COD was shit nowadays so really no one of my friend group played it. 

**BO3:** I came around to this game and its not half bad. **Rating: 5**

**IW:** Didn't play it.  No time. 

**COD4 remastered:** The maps are so overrated. Didn't enjoy instant ttk but had some fun with it. **Rating: 7.5**

**WW2:** Most boring call of duty yet. Had the worst maps and least content. There's 11 free maps in that game I believe? Can't bring more than few hours of entertainment to me. **Rating: 3**

**BO4:** Disgrace to Call of Duty franchise. Felt more like Overwatch than COD. Heroshooter with no campaign and horrible MTX system. Worst graphics. Cartoony. P2w guns. Rushed unfinished mess. **Rating: 1**

**MW19:** Incredible game. Brought something to FPS genre we've never seen before and absolutely killed it in so many areas. There were some absolute quality devs working on this. Not without flaws obviously, but no game is. 
**Rating: 9.6**

**Cold War:** Meh. It's good fun and it brought some features from MW like gunfight but it's a clear downgrade. Middle of the road call of duty. I would give it 7, but with the insane amount of bugs and stuff not working I give one less. **Rating: 6**"
Cod 4 and MW2 hold a special place in my heart the rest I've enjoyed but those 2 were something else for me
"-mw3 underrated and strongly think assault and support killstreaks should come back, maybe take away some of the op support streaks. Good ideas all around specially objectives counting as a kill on the streaks.
-Black ops 3 also underrated, can't think of a bad map besides mayyybe that forest one. 
-Black ops 4 started strong but would of been a better game without specialists, hope that never comes back.
-WWII felt pretty good but some horrible maps, fuck that boat and that ice forest map.
-Modern Warfare is impressive on all the technical aspects but it was an absolute travesty when it comes to map design,if I could get all the maps from any previous cod, even all of mw3 instead of what we got in this game, and it would of been so much better. 
-Cold War, obviously needed more time to bake, Sledgehammer dropping the ball fucked everyone. Good maps make up for it in my regard.

All I can see personally is that maps carry cods for me. I can overlook some technical difficulties but when maps are trash, I just can't enjoy the gameplay loop"
" MW og series were god.  
AW was the worst PC port I�ve seen in a long time.  
BO series: I�m not fan of 3Arch so I can say nothing, but I�ve all BO games.  
Infinite  Warfare. Campaign was amazing. One of the best, but the MP was too bad.  Clunky movement-gunplay and they add P2W guns behind loot boxes.  
Ghosts: I have almost 500h on it on private MP with/against friends. Campaign was good enough.  
WWII: Good campaign but not fan of WWII games, so I don�t play too much on MP. But ""Conquest"" mode was fun enough.  
MW  2019: Good campaign but in general the game is hot garbage. They drip  fed my performance at the same time they drip fed the content. Servers  are like inexistent. SBMM is a dirty whore, and along the entire year,  the game had so many gamemodes changes than bug/issues. I give up with  the game after S2. Just play some matches from time to time.  
CW: No comments needed."
"> AW was the worst PC port I�ve seen in a long time.

I wouldn't know. Lol. I played everything on Xbox before MW2019

> they add P2W guns behind loot boxes

I didn't play a ton of the multiplayer, so I didn't know about that. That's stupid. Anything that's in loot boxes or a paid bundle should never give an advantage. It should only be cosmetic

> in general the game is hot garbage

I personally haven't had most of the issues I see people complain about. I currently have 240 hours and just over 2100 games played since I started playing right around the Warzone launch

> SBMM is a dirty whore

Am I one of the few people people that actually *likes* SBMM? I'd rather play with people that are around my skill level and actually get better at the game instead of either stomping or being stomped by the other team. I'm perfectly happy with my ~~1.01~~ 1.02 K/D"
"I'ee played COD2, MW, and MW2 on PC and loved them.  64 player maps on hardcore was both fun and hilarious chaos.  MW2019 is the first COD for me since switching to console and I must say, not impressed.  Oh and I only like to play on hardcore mode for this and BF.  BF has abandoned hardcore and that makes me sad."
I�m gonna say is that iw is my favourite campaign of every cold it is.
"MW2: My first CoD. Overall a very fun experience. In retrospect, it�s MP isn�t actually as good as we thought. Still, I�d say 8.5/10, given the era it came out in.

BO1: In my opinion, the most well rounded experience. Zombies was at its best, the campaign was excellent, and MP was good. 10/10

MW3: A more subdued MW2. One of my favourite MP experiences. More reasonable weapon balancing, the introduction of specialist. Campaign was ok, spec ops wasn�t as good as MW2. 8/10

BO2: The best MP, without a doubt. The gold standard. Campaign and Zombies were ok. The MP keeps it at 9/10.

Ghosts: At this point I stopped playing campaigns. So MP only. At this point in time, the worst MP at launch. Got significantly better with DLC. 6/10 overall.

AW: Intro of p2w guns. Overall guns and maps felt meh. I feel like on PC, this game would have been more fun, but advanced movement did not feel good to me on controller. 4/10

BO3: I lied, beat this campaign on realistic for the calling cards. It sucked. Didn�t play zombies. MP was overall pretty fun, movement felt more refined. Specialists were a novel idea, albeit annoying at times.  7/10

Infinite Warfare: Didn�t play

WW2: Lacklustre MP at launch, very few maps. Got better with division overhaul and tons of DLC guns. 6/10

BO4: Really great at the start. Game was fluid and fast paced. Specialists were really cancer. Game slowly devolved into garbage as they added more annoying DLC guns. 7.5/10

MW 2019: The absolute worst 6v6 experience in CoD period. Overall level of detail is good. Movement is fun. Guns feel nice. Maps blow. 5.5/10

Cold War: Zombies is okay so far. DOA3 really steals the show for me. MP is the most unfun thing I�ve played so far. For PC, mouse input feels poor. Crossplay balancing is 50 steps backwards from MW. Guns don�t feel as solid as MW.  Game also just likes to crash. 3/10. I would rather play Advanced Warfare."
Ghosts for me was the turd in the group. The guns were just pretty awful and the multiplayer levels just didn�t have a nice flow to them at all. You�ve made a good list but to call WAW �pretty good� is sacrilege. By far the best WW2 shooter there has been and the introduction of Japanese guns was brilliant as they were really funky compared to axis and allies armaments. The campaign was incredible as well for it�s scale and attention to detail
They could make cw f2p and I still wouldn't play it.
"Agreed I wouldn�t play that over MW any day of the week.

CW would have been great if they had used the same engine from MW and then just made it an add on to MW with maps and new operators I would have paid 70 bucks for that easy."
"Yeah, same, it's just more of an incentive to buy MW, honestly. 2 for one, who doesn't like free stuff?

Edit: Apparently the CoD community hates free stuff."
So the last system I bought was the PS3 (I do have a Nintendo Switch but that�s different) so COD Ghosts was the last game I played..just recently got a PS5 and got MW because all my buddies told me not to get CW cause it sucked compared to MW..is it really that bad? What makes it so bad?
I think you�re underestimating how well CW is doing and Activisions game practice.
They can't seem to retain a player base from what I've heard.
Apparently Cold War is a top 20 selling game of all time... such a shame
and lost most of it�s player base within a month lmao
"lmao you're out of your mind if you think activision would do anything like that. Black ops 1 is still 60 dollars on steam and currently 30 dollars only because steam sale. today an article released that cold war broke into top 20 best selling all time. If black ops 1 currently costs 60 dollars, you think they would give you a game for free?. If they won't even give a mw2 mp multiplayer or black ops 1 mp remaster because they want people in latest installments, no way they would give free games man."
"Infinite Warfare is still 60 bucks, and that was insanely unpopular, I don't expect them to, this was just to see the general consensus, and it turns out, people like the fact that the games stop getting support each year and that they have to pay $60 again to buy what is essentially the same game. I underestimated how much people like paying for the same thing over and over again."

Lmfao. COVID played a huge part in that. Most stores like gamestop were closed and MANY people didnt wanna risk going in stores.
"Why would I not like that it's doing well? Why are treating me like I'm hostile? Also, what would be wrong with sharing player bases instead of them competing with each other? The games are stealing players from each other and making it F2P or making MW F2P (depending on how you look at it) wouldn't hurt either game. CoD is competing with CoD, and soon it will have BF to compete with, and if BF only gets released every few years, so that means their live service model actually works. BF will crush CoD if CoD doesn't adapt, and I really don't wanna play dead CoD games. And don't treat this like a ""CoD vs. BF"" thing, or a ""CoD vs. CoD"" thing, I don't care which is objectively better, I just don't want MW's player base to die, or CW for that matter (I wanna get back into at some point, just not rn). Activision took a big step in the right direction with WZ, but other games are gonna start to do the same, WZ is just another free BR in what will inevitably be a sea of free BRs. CoD multiplayer does something no one else does at the moment, but with the way gaming is trending, its business model will be the death of it. 

BTW, if you weren't tryna be hostile, you may wanna drop the ""whether you like it or not"" because that's inherently hostile."
"Longevity isn't a thing with CoD game. Comes another year and a new CoD game is a hot new thing.  Yeah, CW was that great, but wait 8 months and everydody (even Treyarch) will forget about it and Infinity Ward will be almost done with MW2, so they won't give a shit either.

edit : CW *wasn't* that great"
It isn't if you don't do good games. I think they kinda messed up with MW and actually did a well above average game that will probably outlive CW and set a weird precedent.
"Yeah, but would you like to change that, or do you like buying a new CoD every year just so that you can buy it again next year?"
"It�s the scorpion Evo, you can use it in survival mode, you can also level it up so it�ll already be ready when it comes out"
Try turning on anti aliasing
Maybe it�s film grain. By default it�s set to 10
I have a similar thing but I have Filmic anti aliasing on and film grain set to 0. I just chalked it up to it being the game engine.
That first one looked like a movie car chase. I liked it.
Yeah that one was a good on to start with
What do you use to record clips?
Obs record and stream. Free and no problems.
Now that�s how you use a shield
Well if someone's willing to use another finger (referring to the monkeys paw) could they wish back team defender? Love that mode. Oddly it's the only one I ever do well in...at...on...(one of those lol).
Team defender is literally the worst mode ever.
"They fixed some things, but they fucked hardly the perfomance."
im not getting XP still
">	we get it for 2 weeks but with reduced XP

This has always been the case for Shoot the Ship since forever. It�s just balancing the XP since on Shoot the Ship you kill more compared to other playlists/modes/maps. This is not new."
It's trying to tell you something...
Ps5 be like: bro i think u havent heard it but the devs litreally fucked this game anyways im gonna delete redownload did so u cant play.
Have you found any info about this? I've redowloaded the texture packs and multiplayer packs about a dozen times since the PS5 launch. Sigh.
Do you know if we are downloading multiple copies of the same packs? Or is PS5 definitely uninstalling it each time by itself?
"This has just happened to me now. Started to reinstall Multiplayer Data Packs 1 and 2 and Texture Pack 1. All of them were installed previously. In-game it says they are uninstalled but when you go into PS5 storage, then the add-ons for MW, they are still installed. Unless it�s showing the packs on the the add-on list despite them being mid-download... 

Does anyone know if we are installing multiple copies of the same pack or is the game definitely uninstalling them randomly by itself?"

Wow
I wish i could adjust my pov
You�re exploiting a bug dude it might not be against the rules but you gotta have no morals to play like that
Exploiting is 100% bannable.
[deleted]
"Pretty sure it�s just fixed spawns like how it was in the older call of duty games. Like in demolition on black ops 1 you were able to spawn trap pretty easily, the hard part was getting to their spawn and knowing each spawn location. Wont say it�s exploiting."
Ouch. If you�re HoH you need to sort that out QUICK.
Unfortunately I am not lol
"Get a mesh router

The Orbi Wifi 6 goes hard"
I�ll check it out thanks
*so close*
This is just normal CW hit registration
I too thought i was on the cold war subreddit
Looks more like camping to me
"I don�t ever camp, there were 2 guys there a few seconds earlier in the video"
"Its a good idea, probably the reason they wont do it."
All mw needs is a next gen update and some content bug fixes and were good! Micro transactions alone could fund this for a few more years! Both CW & mw have different player bases and mp styles (personally always been an infinity ward fan)
I think that it�s gonna be a while before call of duty releases a game that�s as good as mw 2019 was so personally I think the games we have now should be at the forefront of call of duty. Instead of new games constant updates for MW and updated for Cold War ( for people who prefer black ops over mw).
Cold War just became the 20th best selling game in U.S. history. From where they�re sitting they�re doing just fine.
"Cods potential was realised in like 2007, its been downhill ever since"
Yeah but MW 2019 hits different. This is the one game that deserves to have a life longer than 1 year.
"Looks pretty cool IMO. Looks like the Cold War FFAR with a slick green skull camo. Even though I�ll probably only use it in HC since the Famas isn�t very good in core multiplayer, it�s nice to get another Gunfight Tournament and atleast a little bit of support for Modern Warfare. 

To this day the gunsmith and attention to weapon detail is one of my favourite aspects of this game."
Some people hack to unlock items that are unusable or not out yet could be that? If not then could be one that came in the store maybe with the 4th of July ones?
Dam! Idk maybe he hacked for it but I know dam well he didn�t buy it because I have pretty much every single  one
"None, get it for the riot shield."
"I believe the Riot shield is one of the easier ones, and it looks pretty sleek with it."
"I cracked obsidian on the striker 45 of all things. 
Apparently I play a lot of hardcore."
I just got that obsidian yesterday.
"None of them, get the obsidian for the MP5"
Agreed. I have the obsidian M4 but the M4 kinda sucks handling wise for my more rushy playstyle. Going for Mp5 now but I'm only halfway there
i�ve already done the mp5 but i don�t really use it that much anymore as i have 7000 ish kills with it
X16
RPG so it blacks out the actual missile
Did they bring shipment back??
 Yeah I�ve noticed it�s been shit recently. My internet ain�t even that bad so it�s been frustrating loosing easy kills because it lags mid gunfight
Yeah they�ll never fix it
Yeah it gets extremely bad now and then. Unplayable pretty much at these times
Started about an hour ago.
"Seems to have been shit the past few days. Ground war infected was crashing non stop and last night when I was playing 3v3 every other round had multiple second delay between shot and hit, killcams were just silly"
[deleted]
"mostly the fact that they dont got any recoil to them at all, meaning you can spec way more into important stuff like ADS speed and sprint to fire speed compared to MW where reducing recoil would make you slow as fuck."
"I dont see how you got to that conclusion.
Mac10, M16 and the FFAR are usually the meta guns people use currently. The M16 was recently popularized but is also harder to use than the laser beam ARs from MW.

In most fields the MW guns are better than the CW guns. Most of the CW guns attachments dont even work correctly.
Those 3 Guns are more or less the only ones that stuck out from the rest of the lackluster CW guns.
The best AR in the game is still the AMAX which is a MW gun. 
The most used Sniper Rifles are still the Kar98 and the HDR.
Sure the Mac10 took the #1 SMG spot but so what? people were tired of using the same guns all the time, but there are still MW SMGs that are very good.

https://www.wzranked.com/loadouts/primary/ just go there and have a look. MW Guns are played plenty currently so I dont know why you think its different."
"This game is so fucked. Shooting people in Cold War (atleast on pc) feels like shooting people on warzone. It's just so fucking ass and they take so many shots. I could open the original bo2 on my pc, and it would run smoother than this game does and look better (this game was def not made for pc at all). I'm trying to play Black ops, not a fucking battle royale. They just need to fucking port bo2 to new consoles next year. Also the menu layouts and how the menus look in cold war are so bad and ugly it bothers me sometimes. Im really hoping for a better season 2. Also the maps in this game are the worst maps I've played in any fps I've played. I'd rather play tdm on a fortnite location than what cold war offers. They def just need to not make new maps, and just remake bo2 maps. I hate to be harsh but damn. I paid hella money for this game, and put so many hours into it, I would hate just to have to uninstall it because of a bad season 2. 

Ps. Downvote all you want cold war fans. This game needs some fucking work. 

Pss. Yes, the menu layout in bo2 is like cold war, but there isn't so much fucking options. Hopping onto cold war multiplayer makes me feel like I'm playing a MMO with how much clickable options are on my fudging screen."
There are cold war fans??
/r/CODWarzone
It�s literally a mixed meta rn ran alongside the mac10
Does damage drop off work in team deathmatch in warzone bc i got killed by a mac-10 70 m away or something?
"So i lost my account with damascus obsidian for the as val, galil, mp5 and mp7. I did the account recovery i got it back in my playstation account but it is level 1 with nothing just my cod points and my settings. I still have hope that they will recover my account just for the fact that my cod points was there"
Make sure it was the exact same account. That happened to me also. I did the account recovery through Activision and it took about 8-9 days to get it restored.
"The time between matches Is too fucking long. Cod is a frenetic game, ain't playing s tournament to get a ""waiting for the other matches to end"" screen for a goddamn year"
I would like it a lot more if it didn�t take so long to get into the tournament. They need to increase the time between the tournaments so the lobbies can actually fill up
True
I'm having fun with it honestly. The prizes so far have been pretty cool.
Only played tournament for the final gun but it's a very meh variant of FAMAS
What�s the final gun
"A Famas, I believe. A pretty ""meh"" prize if I'm being totally honest."
It's randomized every round.
The map-pool is far better than the last copy&paste tournaments. Could be the best tournament ever
Haha literally dealing with that right now! I know the pain man. Shipment was actually great for mounted kills. Shame it's gone
The only pain was the no attachments one because I had Shoot the Ship and a blueprint.
Have you looked at its weapon challenges yet?  BTW explosive bolt kills haven't worked to count quick scope challenge part.  It seems it has to be one shot kills.
"Yeah all I have left is long shots thank god, I mainly posted this because my bolt when straight through the enemy. Shots like this made the crossbow unbearable for camos"
"Working on it now. Longshots are a pain!! Once I finish this, I only have the an94 left to do which is almost done. Probably going to do all challenges next or get obsedian for every gun."
"Been a bug since tournaments were released, I find it so funny that it still hasn�t been fixed."
I never had this issue during MW�s life cycle. Just started with this tournament.
Yes they stay 5 minutes loading the match and after he kicks you out of the tournament
Why you had Exp? And rest of us got none
Some people don�t experience bugs
It was fixed
That's a bug? I didn't know. I'm sorry about that.
AN-94 iron sights are asssss. Nice clip tho.
They are very hard to work with xD same with the ISO sights. Too boxy and large to use confortably but they're still good weapons.
The best part. It was the all black roze skin that got owned.
We need a compilation of Roze skins getting obliterated in the most disrespectful ways possible in MW.
I�m sure they know.
Now that�s a cumpliation
"[Me when I saw the victims name](https://media0.giphy.com/media/GHl7ywzbuT8KQ/200.gif)

EDIT: No, that's not me, just in case."
">For example Price description says that to unlock him you can also acquire a skin for the operator 

That is a generic description used for any Operators in the game. It does not necessarily mean there's always buyable skins for every Operator in the game, it more or less applies to the fact that:

A. Base game Operators (which have specific unlock challenges) can all be unlocked just by buying/unlocking other skins.

B. Operators introduced via seasonal battle passes are also unlockable via any skins you acquire, though their ""base"" skins (as in their first skin sets) will not be made available.

In regards to your case, Price and Farah are so far exclusive to the S4 and S6 battle passes (which you have missed obviously). Based on datamined info, it is possible that Activision will introduce buyable bundles for people who missed out on these past battle passes at some point, but we don't know when."
"Ok that kinda confirms what I was suspecting, that they are exclusive to battle passes and that I missed them. Hopefully we will have buyable bundles based on the datamined information you mentioned. Thanks for the answer!!"
You need to buy operator bundles
"Are there any available? While playing Warzone and checking the store I have never seen one for either Price or Farah. Also was checking inn the following link for (supposedly) all operators skin packs and there is not a single pack for any Battle pass related operator (Price, Farah, Nicolai)

[https://codmwstore.com/operator-skins/](https://codmwstore.com/operator-skins/)"
Think you missed them. Maybe if you check the store you'll randomly find one to buy.
"Same here I�m playing multiplayer and I�m only getting �Challenge XP� for doing operator skin challenges, I am not getting any xp for kills or winning the game. Smh

Edit: also since the patch I now have a green dot in my pistols but I can�t find it anywhere."
UPDATE: It didn�t tell me during the match but I recorded the XP number before and after match and I am receiving weapon XP.
I just logged in and had an update and am getting weapon XP now. Still no rank XP though. PS4 as well.
"I�m still not ranking up or getting weapon do. You are not alone, brother."
Let us know when you start getting weapon do.
"Damn, well glad I�m not alone but sucks that there�s still trouble"
So what did they do fix one thing for half of us and the other for half. I'd like to rank up so I can get more weapons.
Yeah this whole situation is a mess
UPDATE: It didn�t tell me during the match but I recorded the XP number before and after match and I am receiving weapon XP.
"U should cuz it's working for me  but where it says assist, elimination and that it doesn't show number but i maxed my ak and leveled up my famas 3 levels"
"I�ll have to play again when I get the chance and actually look at the numbers for XP in my guns before and after match then, just to make sure. Thanks for the heads up! I�ll update with the results when I get time."
"I found that it doesn�t update weapon xp in match, but if you level up your weapon it updates to the new level and show the amount of xp you have gained for that level. When you return to the lobby it shows the correct xp amount. I�ve been getting xp, but it doesn�t show in game."
"You were right, it didn�t tell me during the match but I recorded the XP number before and after match and I am receiving weapon XP."
"Usually refunds are like first 14 days 


And same I enjoy cold war a lot it�s a change of pace from MW and I love that it�s different from MW which I�ve played the past 2 ish years 


I�m glad I got it"
So that means after 14 days of launch they no longer accept any refunds at all?
"Idk what you�re playing on, but Cold War�s graphics isn�t better than Modern Warfare�s. I hate MW for it�s campy play style and stupid game design but you�re def reaching with the graphics. I agree Cold War feels more like a cod but the graphics, movement, connection feels outdated. Even the Cold War Operators look better on Warzone."
"I'm not saying it's better graphics, I'm saying I prefer CW graphics because it feels like CoD. MW's engine is good but CW's is fine for even an outdated one."
Sounds like a Raven dev in disguise.
"lol I kinda dislike Raven for what they did to Diamond camo in Warzone, how is it so uglyyy"
Was wondering when someone was gunna bring this up
What? This post is made every multiple times a day.
I noticed this happening with Domino as well! I did a couple matches (both MP and warzone) and the tracker didn�t move at all (15 AR kills)
"These are the season one missions I believe, which means that you will be able to complete them whenever you but the vault packs, whenever they release"
"I don�t think you would have to buy them tho, because is u have no acces to operator challenges they are grayed out but these are open just don�t track"
Its the FR 5.56 aka the famas
Looks like Famas since its bullpup rifle in the pic
"It's [""The Fallen""](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lioqqk/psa_the_current_tournament_reward_is_the_fallen/), one of the blueprints that turns the FAMAS F1 into a FAMAS Valoris�."
Anyone know if it's for CW or MW?
For mw.
[deleted]
Worths the grind?
The gun is based on another famas model and is more small than the default which i think helps a bit since it doesn't take much space on the screen
I have it but the only reason why I did it was because tournaments are fun
"I would say no. I don�t like the Famas, but other people do so each their own."
Not really it's a very meh variant of the FAMAS
That gon be a no for me dawg
Its the FFAR from cold war
"It looks like it, but there is a line of Fr 5.56 (famas) blueprints that look like that"
"It�s an mw Fr 556, it�s one of the variants that look like the gun the cw Ffar is based on"
I�ve been stuck on that too. Have you also been getting the error code 2048 too or is it just me? The error messages say that I�ve been disconnect from the MW servers even though activision says the servers are functional.
Sometimes I get stuck and the only thing that solves it is restarting. I usually get it after it says I�ve been disconnected from servers or my internet has lost connection.
"PS4 here I still am getting no weapon XP


UPDATE: I am getting XP, it just doesn�t tell me. It I have to look after the match"
Weird. On pc they fixed it and it Great
Yeah
Appreciate it
Xbox too?
wait there's a new tournament?
yeah the loadouts are kinda decent too
The calling card is pretty nice
"Only fix is going to be contacting support, it sounds like. CoD points should redeem pretty much instantly upon purchase.

Did you check the transaction went through? Has the money left your account?

Normally Activision is pretty on it when it comes making sure the Store is working properly. The rest of the game might broken AF, but the Store always works flawlessly."
"The money was removed from my account, hence why I was even able to ask Xbox support on a refund request. I�ll contact support now. Thanks man."
I had the opposite. I leveled up the battle pass on mw then went to Cold War to buy it and my game crashed (Cold War crashes the ps5 a lot) and I went back in and the battle pass was bought but I kept my cod points. It�s been a week now so I�m guessing i get to keep it
"Got this today on my Series X, did a hard reset and got back on no trouble..."
Playstation is attempting to time travel
"I think I had that and a hard reboot fixed it but I can't remember 100% if it was that one..... ""Held power button for 10 sec"""
Use 2FA too
"Hmm, looks like they finally added it back in Nov, guess I missed it with all the CW updates."
I did this to myself at least three times per shipment game.
"looks like a close approximation to the Mk46�s rail system, though the weird slanted rail in front of the front sight post is a little bit of an oddity"
Thank you.
Hold up. Theres a split screen? Is it for pc?
Console. And it used to work great in MW before the early February update broke it.
I didn�t realise this was linked to split screen but it�s been getting worse each update
"Gaz: Mission accomplished, good work."
You're getting XP!?!?!  Did they patch it???
I didn�t realize that was a bug... this is from yesterday if that changes anything.
As of this morning the weapons do has been patched.
Game is too much fun.
Just saying you where just pretty much spawn camping
"That�s the only way you would win gun game on shipment, it�s an absolute clusterfuck."
You are cracked my guy
Mine was working actually
"I gotta correct myself, its fixed, it just didnt show until I left the game. It lags a little"
"I've played every COD to some extent. Some more than others. This is the first one that I've played for an entire year and continue to play on a daily basis. Something about the feel and gunplay is so addicting to me that I can't play any other shooters without feeling a little let down. Even with all of the bugs and frustrations, I still find things to like about the game. That's my reason for not installing at least. I still can't understand why a company of their size can't be a little more transparent with us though. That's my biggest issue."
Yeah man no other shooters compare.
Spec ops in mw2019 always sucked which makes me sad becayse i was hoping it would have been like spec ops in mw2
It was such a hard thing to mess up. They would have been better off just reusing the missions from mw2
"I would like to convince you to not uninstall it, but honestly I don't have a good reason to. This game is so tilting that I've barely touched it in the last couple weeks."
"Just uninstall, believe me your life will be better."
"I can�t bro.... I just have it installed to play with/against friends on weekeends, but now, with another performance drainage, it would be harder to keep it installed cuz it�s directly unplayable to me."
"fascinating post. Warzone has been part of MW for almost a year, spec ops was broken from the start, campaign has been out... from the start obviously, and the XP issue has just been fixed. There is NO Cold War in MW multiplayer other than the background pic when you start the game. There is also no battlepass... because the next CoD released several months ago and that's how it always works.

did you come to all these realizations just now?"
"Is it confirmed the xp glitch is fixed?

Update: I can confirm the weapon xp is fixed, but from what I can see my overall progression is still not leveling"
"Basically the whole store in mw multiplayer is black ops, there are ads when you get into the main lobby, I get constant unlocks for black ops only while playing mw multiplayer, my rank displayed changes all the time (not the xp glitch) bc of the Cold War leveling system. I was rank 755 before Cold War came out (said so in accomplishments and is total level from when game came out) and It made me restart all my leveling back to nothing, so all that work for nothing bc a new game came out that has nothing to do with mine. You can�t say Cold War isn�t put in your face every moment you play."
lol what game have you been playing?
"Meh, don't worry. Just wait for new CoD that will be connected with MW/BOCW, Activision will add ads everywhere again and they will burn BOCW to the ground, like they did with MW."
Yeah I've already decided I'm never buying another COD ever again. I like my games to last longer than a year. I may have ADHD but even my attention span isn't that short.
"""terrible precedent that could cost them the franchise"" wtf are you guys smoking"
If they start a storyline they should finish it. that's not an unreasonable request lol.
"Definitely, they still owe us the three unreleased weapons, and for the final update they should add in separate playlists for shipment and shoot house 24/7"
Bro fuck that update next gen to 120 fps and fov sliders it�s so stupid
"I couldn't care less for Shipment but if the game got a permanent Shoot House 24/7, I would be playing this shit WAY more"
"I wish the same thing man. This cod was HUGEE, definitely deserve more than a year"
"IW probably had the plans... i mean 3 unrealesed guns, and i think maps too... but activision put all of this on hold to boost CW sales"
They don�t owe us anything but I could see new content coming in March to coincide with WZ�s anniversary.
"Even after raking in [3 billion](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-04-call-of-duty-has-brought-in-usd3-billion-in-past-year) from our wallets last year through micro-transactions and sales, they don't owe us? Man, you're on a short string. 

They owe us a lot more in DLC. Stuff like new story expansions (in Co-op), new weapons, gameplay tweaks and overhauls, bug fixes, etc should all be included. For the amount of money they make from these games, there should be more of them."
Sequel?
Possible sequel* my bad
"I'm actually scared for them to release a new season, and I know I'm in the minority.

I was so excited for the AS-VAL and the SPR, now I wish they never added them at all. I wish they just called it quits at Season 5, and supported the game with bug fixes and overall server stability. I do not trust Infinity Ward or Raven to balance anything properly, MP multiplayer has been so damn boring since the new season."
"Every single gun they added post-launch is problematic. Either broken as fuck (as val in multiplayer, bruen in warzone pre nerfs, spr both warzone+multiplayer before nerfs) or completely useless and not used (rytec,An-94)."
Yeah they really should've just done a Season just to fix a bunch of the bugs and implement more dedicated servers to fine tune the stability of the game. Kinda like a 'Operation Health' (from Rainbow Six) for MW.
My thought is why does warzone even need a plot? Who cares? Not everything needs lore or a story.
"I always thought the plot of each Season was new additions to the Co-op mode.   
Apparently not.  
Maybe they've been working on some extensive DLC for Co-op (like GTA Online's Heist mode) for a while now and those were just teasers until its release sometime this year? Maybe maybe?"
"HAHAHAHA!!! 

You're STILL giving Activision the benefit of the doubt? Good god, you deserve to gargle that activision D then"
"Hello yes, I'am from the new CoD game... Hey, hey, hey! Wait before I get no scoped and brutality murdered let me explain. I agree and think that there should be a finale or a better ending."
I agree give us a battlepass with the missing guns and soap etc.
"We aren't owed shit, doesn't matter how much they made or whatever it is. They don't owe us anything, and thinking that is just wah-wah baby entitlement. However, I do wish they wouldn't try to pretend MW didn't exist. They try to overshadow it with CW so hard, that in CW when looking at friends, anyone playing MW is shown as ""Online"" on warzone. If they actually have warzone open, it just says ""pre-game lobby""."
What happened to those Guns that they wanted to release? Are they still coming or does MW not get updates except for bug fixes anymore?
What sens you play on? Do you play dynamic aim response and is your aim assist relative to your fov?(forgot the setting name)
Is there no slowdown or no assisted tracking?
I believe it's 100% server side. they are having issues not you. I've had packet burst last few days after not seeing it for months and months.
"I�ve been experiencing it in every game since the game released. I�m convinced that I�ve done something in the settings, but I�m not entirely sure of that either."
I have been waiting for a fix for months. I just gave up and stopped playing...
I found a fix. I�ve been using a third party app called EXITLAG. It definitely has smoothen the game out for me after a few days of trying it out. I�ll get packet burst here and there but very minimal. A 75% fix which is great because I was getting the boxes 100% of. the time
"As someone who has those skins, hell yes they should do that.  Exclusivity helps no one."
"Facts, they�d make more money, and anyone that missed any can get them"
"Absolutely agreed, exclusivity is basically always terrible."
"I like your style,"
You got all the reason
I would be happy.. I would have been happy to purchase  the battle pass seasons I missed too.
I really want that White Tier 100 Ghost skin. So hell yes.

They should do a lot of older content like the reaper pack too from twitch.
Wouldnt mind the rebirth island challenge coming back.  That Hazardous gun looked pretty awesome
Fuck that everyone would just run black roze.
"I dunno, I always find myself running Orange Bale, Orange Zane, and Yellow Kruger."
There are plenty of other skins to run than rose. For instance I've encountered mara's digital darkness skin and it has littlerally startled me
"mara is from season 1.... a year ago. you get stitch now.

the missions you see (for almost all operators not just mara) are just visual bugs from last week's update. you cannot do them."
I�ve been waiting for hit markers because I like to know when hit
Ive been waiting for a toaster strudel flag because i identify as a strudel.
You know pan is a sexuality and not a gender right
"P sure the flags are not for representing sexual preferences. CoD is for shooting nerds, not letting us know what youre wanting to have sex with.  Share it on reddit, sure, but for fuck sake- leave it out of the game. Dont get all sensitive either, im not picking on you. All of us here are idiots and i hate everyone equally."
"|>  not letting us know what youre wanting to have sex with

dont these people call gamers like us incels who never have sex?

edit: nvm theres someone in the comment section already calling everyone incels."
"Yeah I can understand that, I would understand if they didn�t add it but they have added pride flags ya know so why not more"
Welcome to Clownworld.
"I�m just asking a question, you don�t have to be a asshole about it"
pan ahhh yeah pans mmm
Non stick pans mmmmmm
they added it together with the other sexuality :) not sure if activision and co deleted it.
just play the fucking game.
"Be careful. Posting stuff like this is bound to piss off the incels, they�re not accepting of pansexuals or anything like that"
"I know lol, what do I expect from people that play cod"
Fyi: nobody here fucking cares about what you choose to stick your dick inside.

The xp glitch was patched this morning
Yes it is
Any suggestions on a primary for the launchers?
"My advice is do the most miserable weapons first. That would be (IMO) Riot Shield and then melee. Launchers won't seem so painful at that point.

Otherwise you'll get to those at the end and probably lose your will to live...

And this should be obvious, but choose game modes that will work well for whatever weapon you're doing. Hardcore for Riot Shield (to get the OHKO), Core for melee, Ground War for launchers, etc."
Oh god this is going to be miserable. Why did i want to do this again?
I've a good sheild strat if u want?
Please share for those who are working on it.  I was looking all over when I made that grind and there wasn�t much available at the time.
Sure. I need all the help I can get.
I had to try offline then going online after clicking it
Wdym? When i click it send me to the game install screen
It will be the same fps unfortunately
What are your specs?
I'm sorry I played on ps4 whole time so I don't know shit about pc. But I can find it what things are important?
Depends on your gpu

Because people don't understand how to play domination on this game for some reason
Really annoys me!
just fighting over B is boring and makes it easier for campers.
"One of the reasons is that the spawns are horrible. As soon as you take the B flag the spawns flip. Making your team spawn on the third flag. As soon as your team gets in the middle of the map, the other team spawns on both sides."
Could be such a good game..
"But this makes sense, thank you!"
Add to that the fact that they also cant or wont play kill confirmed correcrly. Very veeeery few players collect tags. Most just run by them
"Played a game of KC on Vacant the other day. I had 21 confirms, one other guy on my team had 6, and two others had 1 each. Needless to say we lost.

At the end of the match I said, ""You guys do realize this is Kill Confirmed right?"" The whole lobby cracked up. One person said, ""I'm not too concerned about it"" and a person on the winning team said, ""I don't think they do."""
I play HQ instead because
"lol what?

Cap the third flag to dominate.  It's pretty simple."
I like to hear the announcer say �We�re dominating them. Keep up the pressure.�
"You�re obviously part of the problem. You�re not dominating, you�re giving the other team the change to take back control over the match. 

Domination is not that hard, cap your spawn flag then cap B. They will keep spawning at their flag, all your team has to do is cut down lanes and you win the match... Capping the third just causes the spawns to be all over the place. 

I REPEAT: CAPPING THE THIRD IS NOT DOMINATING"
"It often happens because people don�t understand the nature of Domination. However, it seems to occur just as frequently as an additional �fuck you� if one team clearly is dominating (in skill, not just captured flags). So I�ve learned to roll with it; win/loss is irrelevant anyway."
Indeed. For players who like to play the objective it�s quite annoying.
it�s a famas (FR 556) blueprint
It was removed for me
Oh good� I thought I was going crazy. Hopefully we get it back today
"had some crappy loadouts and the usual stack campers if you happened to get that map. akimbo snakeshots in one round, jaak 12 frag rounds in another. also had 2 randoms quit, 1 quit while we were close to winning by 2. the other quit due to the enemies camping on stacks and we were losing by 4."
"Launchers, Marksman, LMG, SMG, Handguns then ARs. Save Melee for StS.  I made the mistake of saving launchers and Snipers for last.  I'd say run a launcher with every loadout that's an LMG, SMG and AR. You can rack up quite a few camos just by having it as a secondary as your leveling/camo grinding other guns."
Aight where should I start with launchers. Rpg or jokr. Also is the xp glitch still in multiplayer because if so imma have to boot up warzone to get them done.
">  I'd say run a launcher with every loadout that's an LMG, SMG and AR. You can rack up quite a few camos just by having it as a secondary as your leveling/camo grinding other guns.

Sorry but does this mean that your launcher will level up and earn camos just by having it as your secondary and not necessarily using/equipping it?"
"Launchers. Go on any mode and grab any weapon class (AR's take the longest, so I would suggest start there. Or maybe the knife and shield)

At the same time you do those, destroy any streak you can find. Start backwards with the RPG, then JOKR, Strela and PILA"
"I argue that LMGs and SMGs take longer, just with the amount of kills you need to unlock some of the camos."
"Alright I'll do that. Also, is there are sort of loophole-ey kinda thing with rpgs. Do melee/gunbutt kills count for them?"
launchers
"I just got my launchers and melee done. Im really glad I got those out of the way. I already had several AR's and several SMGs gold/obsidian, but instead of finishing them i just focused on the riot shield. I then did the knife in like 1 hour. Next, for the launchers you wanna level them up to max before doing anything, that way you can knockout multiple challenges at once by shooting down personal radars. The JOKR is hardest to kills with. The RPG is hardest to shoot kills streaks with. For killstreaks, just continue camo grinding other categories and have your launchers as secondary. Be ready to shoot down UAVs as soon as you hear them. Let me know if you have any questions on any of the launchers. I got each launcher done in 2 days, which is pretty fast considering how tedoius they are. I can give you some tips on getting those platinum really fast. I can help with the riot shield also, that thing was a pain."
Alright. Any tips on how to get Jokr kills somewhat effectively? Since there isn't shipment I can't just lock on random spots and fire.
None
Good choice.
After you get the kill challenges for the launchers just use them as secondaries and every time something pops up just shoot it down. They go a lot faster like that.
I was expecting a rant
And while we�re at it - BRING BACK SHOOT THE SHIP.
yeah thats been broken for a couple days now.
I got so excited when I saw this lol
"visual bug. that mission is not supposed to be available and you cannot do it (same goes for similar missions on most other operators, they all appeared last week along with the other 20 bugs)"
Same
"Also, it would be too much to ask for the weapon   XP tokens we wasted I guess"
but the xp for leveling up is not fixed yet right like im still stuck on level 171 and getting 0 xp after games
"I have a question: in hardcore, there is friendly fire, but after a few friendly shots, it becomes reflected so only you die. So, if you have the jug and friendly fire, will you insta-die and lose the jug? Or just take damage?"
I wish I was good enough to get a jug to answer this question
"Pretty sure you'll take damage. I have no personal experience with it, but I've seen quite a few Juggs in HC and not seen them suicide from TKs"
"Damage reflects, so you don't instant die."
I hate how whenever you finally get jug everybody leaves the lobby
And then new ones join this fuckfest
This is evil
What song is this
Turbo Killer by Carpenter Brut
Damn son! I wish I could experience this
Upvoted for the music
[Carpenter Brut - Turbo Killer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy9r2qeouiQ)
well yea on shipment where u dont really gotta move lmao
Carpenter Brut? I can respect the music choice for sure
It's the only time this fat ass can run faster lol. Nice video.
How many kills did u end up with lol
It feels good that someone is still getting some xp.
"I tried, played four matches and it�s still 0/7"
I had an issue with the scorpion not showing progress but when i hit the required games it unlocked. I think it just stays 0/7 visually but havent tried with the LMG
Try it in plunder
the weapon xp was fixed??? what???
"[Yep, T'was fixed](https://twitter.com/RavenSoftware/status/1360257492383637507?s=19)"
"What is going on here, why is there a new gun what am i missing"
"There are 3 unreleased guns that are currently only usable in survival and weapon drop field upgrades: the RAAL LMG, the Sykov pistol (aka the Makarov) and the cx-9 SMG."
"Still broken btw 10+ matches, 0/7"
unreal.
[deleted]
nobody could love THAT
"nope, i still dont progress that challenge"
"Try and do it in plunder, I unlocked the pistol and smg through plunder."
What�s considered a scout optic?
Scout Combat Optic and VLK3.0X are the ones I know
can anyone confirm this is working now?
Yes you are correct about these things. Unfortunately no fixes yet. Ridiculous.
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, my controller was also  only a few months old when I had the sprint issue, and it also worked fine on other games. There are ways to �fix� it, which consist of pulling up on the stick, rotating and blowing into it. That fixed it but only temporarily, sometimes for a day and sometimes for a game or two.
I got a new controller and it went away completely. Best advice I can give is to turn on auto tactical sprint so you don�t have to spam L3 and have the same thing happen again"
Only solution I can think of is to turn on automatic Tac Sprint. Try that and see if it works.
"This game can bug out really strangely.

For months on my 3 PS4 accounts, I can't mount to anything... it just doesn't work. Tried every option for mounting, just refuses to do it.

On my Xbox account... which ever operator I choose, isn't the one that's used in game... so now I just leave it on random.

This game is the buggiest CoD ever."
"when i try to tac sprint on PC it doesnt work like half the time, but i am seeing the packet burst logo. annoying as fuck"
"Just thought I would update for posterity:
Two significant updates later and my sprint function works fine. Same controller."
I'm on PC and my soldier rank icon in-game is stuck at recruit. I suspect that is related to lack of end of match XP.
"Yea on ps5, fixed hitmarker issue but still not leveling up"

This happened to me for like two days then stopped.
"I�m having the exact same issue, they need to pull their finger out their ass."
I�m waiting on the download as I type this. This pisses me off
Thanks
"YES, hopefully your not messing with us"
"I can post proof, but it may be just me. We'll have to wait and see when more people post on this thread."
Nothing on Ps5 yet
"While not showing the numbers IRL on PS4/5, it�s still tracking. My VAL just leveled up after playing Reinforced"
Looks like player levelling is still broken... just played a match and got 0 XP
Same
"Wait, when did Raven start informing the community of updates instead of IW?

What the fuck is going on?!"
Raven took over Warzone/MW when CW came out. My guess is that IW moved on to the next project
They�re taking over support for warzone/MW I think
PS4 here still not gaining weapon XP
They changed the UI selector to be Black Ops themed. This is fucking embarrassing
I've been getting literally zero player XP
Just played a few matches of TDM and S&D and my reticle is still taking time to load or sometimes completely invisible.
"I thought I was the only one having this problem.  Have to snipe using only my tac laser in warzone basically.


Only started happening like last week too"
[deleted]
[deleted]
"weapon xp appears to still be broken in my case, I�m on pc"
"Same here, wtf???"
Same I�m not gaining anything
Wow. Fixing bugs in MW to lure people into a false sense of security so they buy Cold War. These sick fucks.
I knew if I checked the comments there would still be people suffering with EXP loss. Feels bad MWbros
"At this point, I honestly think its a ploy to get us to play cold war cause my cold war xp works fine"
PS4 still getting NO PX other than challenges!
Hit markers still broken
Still broken as fuck. Stuttering constantly
LETS GOOOO
Now if only they could fix the standard exp issue and the operator missions not tracking. Ive been level 133 for a week with multiple hours a day playing.
Did they re add a shipment or anything?
The my lowered it�s rotation I have played it once in 5 days.

its backckk!!
Pog
"Finally.

<spoke to soon>. They only fixed Weapon XP. End-of-round match XP and soldier rank are still stuck at recruit level."
Yep.  Just played a round to test it and I�m still stuck at Level 1 on PS4.  Still don�t get any XP to level up.
"Can confirm, just played a round, got a grand total of 0 XP. Following round, 42 kills, 250 XP. -.-"
"Wait hang on. Soldier xp? As in �normal� levelling? If that�s broken and they haven�t fixed it that�s disgusting, but I could�ve misunderstood"
"Aye-firm-ative still fucked.   I was able to get a level up on my pistol I've been grinding so I can at least get back to camo's but  FIX the damn XP!!

An if this is their Valentine playlist for us then I know who's getting the ""Kiss MY Ass""  candy heart!"
"Doesn�t matter that they run the same engine, Raven software is as far as I know not touching MW multiplayer, only Warzone as it�s a stand alone title"
"Cynical side of me says they purposefully removed XP from MW multi-player because they don't want you to level up playing the older game anymore.  They want you to buy Cold War.

Until they fix it, that's what I'm thinking.  Hope I'm wrong and it was a bug."
my weapon xp is also still broken
I can actually level up my guns now. Man. It really shouldn't have taken them this long to fix this.
So you updated already?
"Still not getting match xp after games, after the update today."
Same
already? man i love these guys they�re so fast
Still better response times than EA/DICE.
Eh some could argue lol but hey.. it's here and hopefully a fix
"Just went 23-1 in tdm and got 0XP lol game mechanics are fixed and feel good but XP is absent still, for me at least."
Same here. Hit markers are back which is a win but still no goddamn XP
"Thank goodness, it's about damn time."
"Oh, just rebooted game after update message, seen fixed ui. Now going into match 8)

UPD: as i see weapons getting XP now."
"What about player rank xp? I just got my PS5 and got MW like 2 days ago and have been stuck at 1 and can�t rank up, can�t even modify my damn load out till I�m level 4.."
Fuck yeah! Cheers
I still see no XP tho...
You get an update yet? Or playlist update or server maintenance notice?
"Soo I'm not getting XP after a match but the hitmarkers, reticle, and camo issues are fixed for me. (OCD me) notices that the white lines (N,S,E,W) on the screen reticle still turn to the load ping dots after tac sprint for a split second."
Hitmarkers are fixed for me as for weapon XP all my weapons are max anymore so it doesn�t apply to me but I still get no rank xp.
"Same, wasn't too worried about XP cuz i got everything leveled and damascus but the no hit markers was fuckin me up"
"Weapon XP is fixed, menu is fixed, match XP isn�t and reticle lag isn�t."
"Finally, 1 week later"
You must be new around here

Thanks for the link
"I�m getting Servers undergoing maintenance atm. ~2 min wait time to get in the game. One good thing about this bug, got into the campaign, it�s pretty fun"
"Good deal, bout to log on myself and see"
Bro they best give us something for it
Forreal man
"Fina-fucking-lly. Now this sub can move to something else. It was hard visiting this past week. 

I�m trying to see cool replays, not dumb theories about how MW is getting sabotaged"
"I'll be sure to add some clips for you homie, cuz yea past week has been cringe"
I wonder what they broke now ...
I believe the issue stems from Warzone still using MW client in Battlenet etc?
"I believe so as well, that's why I'm hopeful"
yep just got a small update and hitmarkers are fixed for me now
"Awesome, yeah I'm at the server undergoing maintenance screen"
"wait, why isnt infinity ward not fixing this?"
Because Raven is in charge of Warzone and warzone runs off the engine as MW. Infinity Ward is working on the next MW
Raven isn�t doing Mw multiplayer that�s infinity wards job
"It was, now it's in Ravens hands.. IW is focusing on the new MW"
It is Raven�s job when they were responsible for fucking it up in the first place
I still am not gaining any weapon XP
Yeah same here what gives
"I may get roasted for this, but the SPR short barreled quick scope is the new noob tube.  IMHO, zero skill and over powering.  Then again, I just enjoy running around with a knife and dead silence."
"Yeah I agree, but if I may ask what does the SPR have to do with this clip?"
This games optimization is garbage at best. Every update seems to degrade further and further.
"Definitely. I used to be able to get over 200 frames around season 5-ish. Can�t get anywhere near that anymore. 

Every update has lowered the amount of frames I can get, which is annoying. Latest update has butchered my frames, though. I don�t know what�s going on."
"I just jumped right now to check if RAAL�s challenge was fixed (nope), and I lost 10 frames."
Driver issue more than likely
"Drivers are fine. Updated, then uninstalled, then reinstalled. 

Issue persists. No issues on other games."
"I mostly play ground war. Before I would get between like 220-320 depending on the location. Now im getting between like 160-210, so yeah something definetly happened to this game with all the recent updates."
"There�s been a bug that�s affected everyone�s ability to level up guns in MW since the update a week ago. You can still unlock camos in the categories you�ve unlocked, as well as complete missions for wepon skins and daily challenges, but you for some reason won�t obtain any XP for your guns to level them up. This apparently doesn�t happen in Warzone though, but ranking them up there will take much longer. Infinity Ward has apparently acknowledged the bug and had said they�re �looking into it� despite not changing anything in yesterday�s update. Maybe it�ll take more time? Who knows. Some people have been claiming that this is deliberate Sabotage by Infinity Ward to get more sales/player numbers for Cold War, but I�m still a little skeptical. 

TL;DR - For now, for some reason, there is a bug that doesn�t let anyone level up their guns in MW. Infinity Ward knows about it, and is �working on it�"
"Thanks for the reply you kind soul. Yeah I've finished the camo's that are available to me, just need more level's to unlock the two last camo's. Thanks!"
Oh my...
Give me Shoothouse 24/7 back and fix the fucking progression
"While I agree this game is better then BOCW,
You dont have an argument because you saw a popular reddit post, and you want only 1 map.

There are many more issues that are more important. For example, on xbox one, me and my wife keep getting memory error 13-71. We have tried everything to fix it but a couple updates ago they all stopped fixing it. Other issues include that this game became a advertisement for BOCW.

While its true the community wants shipment 24/7, if they made the most popular playlist constant, it would lose the want the playerbase has. If they make  keep it a rotating game mode, but increase the speed in which it come back into the rotation, I think the playerbase would be happy."
"The gunsmith armory free content, battle pass and crossplay were what made mw great. Map packs just led to dead lobbies especially without crossplay, i could spend a whole hour creating multiple variants of a gun, only flaw is big barrel no stock looks stupid asf but it worked too good. The saddest part of all is that MW became a great game towards the end of its lifecycle only to be replaced by another incomplete game that will also be at its best when its replacement is already released. This is why we need a ""Year Two""."
Nah I think the peak for MW was the season 2-3 era. Performance has gone downhill with all the poor optimazing they needed to do with warzone and the content on the last seasons were pretty shit IMO.
"Ye right, there's no need for ""every year's cod"" anymore because CoD can be great, it IS great already, and it can receive at least some more love from devs & players. Idk what is Bobby Kotick thinking about with this BO:CW agenda and ""erasure"" of codmw everywhere"
"I�m sorry to say a post on Reddit won�t change Activision�s mind. The only way to affect change is to vote with your wallet. The reality is people will buy Call of Duty games every year and Activision knows this. It�s guaranteed money.

MW 2019 was the best CoD since the original MW and I play it every day. If I hadn�t gotten Cold War free with my graphics card I would never have played it. It�s a shameless cash grab. But people still bought it and that incentivizes Activision to keep making a yearly iteration."
"Not only have people bought it, there is an insane amount of cock slobbers that won't acknowledge how subpar the clearly underdeveloped game is."
"It�s just TDM on WZ ""maps"", so you choose from your loadouts."
"Ok, cheers"
"There's always a bunch of snipers in Rumble, I've seen them the most on Bridge, Hospital, and Promenade East. But there are plenty of people going mid with ARs and the like"

Apparently there's a trello board on the subject with them saying they are currently working on it but can't seem to find it. ModernWarzone on Twitter posted confirming they saw it so who tf knows at this point..
On twitter they say theyre aware of the issue
Which Twitter account? I have seen them comment on it....  maybe I�m following the Twitter account.
Whilst you�re at it get rid of sbmm pretty please
It�s fixed now
wait actually?
Oh yeah the Xp bug is fixed ?
"the free operators you got is a bug thats why you cant unlock them.... hate it as well and i cant even unlock skins from S5 (that i actually got) and its still bugged for months.

IMO Activision deserves the hack and not CDPR so we could build our own MW with private servers and without SBMM :)"
No? I already had the operators unlocked after I completed the campaign
They say say they list to their community my arse they do
"I've even tried it on all of the operators, like gaz, rodion, minotaur, azur, all of them aren't even working"

I've had this happen in Headquarters on Vacant once. I was so done with that round even though we won.

what platform are u playing on?
PC
did repair the game or do something about it? some say  reinstall it but I'm in no mood for that
What IW gives us.. nothing the past 2 months. Feelsbadman.
"Ayo, don't blame iw, blame Activision."
Same for the guns... I just want a completely plain goddamn carry handle M16. And some real world stylized blueprints (e.g. the sig should have a blueprint where it has the M4's close quarters stock since they manufacture a real variant like that).
"I completely feel this, and I will never forgive myself for missing out on the ""OG"" m4 blueprint"
99% of the posts on this sub are exactly about this problem
"Pretty shitty that this is still happening. Honestly. Play Warzone Rumble, xp works there for me and it's pretty much Groundwar but in a smaller area with no tanks."
Really? Weird. You must be the only one with this issue. Surely there aren�t 75 topics a day about this issue.
"It's happening to everyone in modern warfare atm. It's a ""bug"", but considering it's been happening to some players for like a week now it's suspicious how long it's taking them to fix it.
If you want to level up weapons unfortunately you're gonna have to play warzone, plunder or that big tdm mode that's in warzone atm. Guns still level up in wz, just not mw."
Dude I literally need 4 more levels for my last attachment and I cant even get it bc of this shit
"Unfortunately you're gonna have to play warzone or plunder or something.
I've been doing that team death match rumble mode on warzone to get a few levels for some guns so I can grind camos in modern warfare.
Isn't it crazy how we have to play another game, to level up our guns in the game we bought."
"Yap, so I played ,2 hours of MW and didn't get any level XP , and no Battlepass Xp ! I went to ColdWar and suddenly I leveled up 15 level and 4 battlepass tiers after 1 hour.....

It isn't a bug, I think is for purpose to people move to CW since MW is forgotten.

Activision is acting like EA and only wants money , not community respect."
Spot on!
"Wrong sub. This is a CW weapon being used in Warzone, irrelevant to this MW sub.  


You want r/CODWarzone"
Bruh you even considered the air flow and aimed slightly right.

"Nope you cant, cuz you dont own them. Unless you owned them back then. Lets say you owned season 4 BP, and you have cpt. Price, but you never did its Challenges. If you do now, you get those skins, but if you haven't bought season 1 BP you cant get mara skin from season one, even if you have her season 3, DD skin.
Its a glitch that last update messed it up."
"Yeah that makes sense and i hate the fact that i had hopes that its actually active lmao,thanks for answering and have a nice day."
I believe thoes are tier skips and you have completed the battle pass by the looks of it
Yeah I've only got two tears to go and didn't they remove tier skips
"I've tried a few, straight up broken too"
"Guess we'll have to wait for Season 2, maybe the challenges work then"
Yea I tried them for rodion and d-day. Broke af. On top of the no xp thing...
"They from S1. If you didn�t have S1, then you (like me) are SOL."
My disappointment is immeasurable. And my day is ruined.
"No challenge should be locked unless you don't have the skin unlocked? I have done multiple challenges from season 1-6 in this season and they all worked. Even before CW integration they worked. I think it's just a bug, like the rest of the game."
"To add on to the maybe 20000 times this has been posted, these are visual bugs. These challenges are from previous season passes and operator bundles, and if you don�t own them you can�t complete them. It�s probably in anticipation of vault packs of season operator skins that are expected to drop in the near future"
Or just play the game 0_0
Weapon progression is disabled in full version of the game
"First post about this that I have seen. No one seem to mention that unlocking stuffs in Warzone works just fine? Maybe because they filter out all of them. And how they said Warzone is the new frontier of Call of Duty? As much as people want to dismiss another tinfoil-hat theory, honestly, you would be a fucking idiot to say otherwise. It�s pretty obvious that they want people to play Warzone since they couldn�t force people to play CW.

This is bigger than the M4, MP5 or the 725, bigger than the AS Val or the SPR, bigger than SBMM. THIS IS LITERALLY GAME BREAKING. I CAN�T LEVEL UP MY FUCKING WEAPONS and I refuse to believe that the team behind the best selling CoD tittle of all time and the team that was running one of the most popular BR in recent years...CAN�T HOTFIX THIS SIMPLE OF A BUG!!! It�s almost intentional, or maybe BECAUSE IT IS.

I couldn�t even make a post discussing with people in this sub about Warzone but people can bash CW just fine? Warzone will die, MW/CW and CoD itself are gonna go down with it when the pandemic ends and other studios capitilizing on what MW was and what it was supposed to be."
"Bumzone is not a new frontier, it's just a free demo of CoD MW. You can try one map and two game modes and if you like the game you will buy it"
"It is obvious they want to kill MW. They are gonna keep releasing shitty cods after mw and that's why they are looking so desperately for a way to intentionally make people quit.
So yeah, you are right, it appears that IW made a game with such a level of quality and love, that Activision cannot allow it. They want more games like CW, a rushed and recycled easy-to-make pile of garbage."
Or just play plunder... way better method than this shit. You get to use your own load outs while earning xp
"Plunder has only one map, it's boring to play the single map all the time"
"No one seem to mention that unlocking stuffs in Warzone works just fine? And how they said Warzone is the new frontier of Call of Duty?

"Honestly, I can see why you might think that, but I don't think it is intentional. I think incompetence and lack of willingness to allocate resources trumps nefarious intent as a likely explanation in this case.

Others have mentioned that most of IW's team is probably busy working on their next title. That seems plausible. It's not that they put the bug in the game intentionally to encourage migration to CW / WZ, it's just more profitable for them to work on the next thing to start selling us than fix a game for customers' whose money they've already taken.

Obviously, this is a really short-sighted move. I think Activision will be surprised at how many people decide to skip the next CoD installment and just move to Battlefield instead. That's certainly my plan. But what else can you expect from a large company whose decision-making process is entirely governed by a handful of shareholders whose only objective is maximising revenue in the next quarter?"
"It's such a shame, but Activision is Activision, a scummy as hell company. The ceo is a real piece of work.
Modern warfare is the most fun I've had in cod since Bo2, and maybe it is intentional but I just can't see it. If they wanted people to stop, they could just shut down the servers. I mean you can still play MW3 on the 360 (weapon levels work fine there haha) so I doubt infinity ward want to neglect modern warfare. It's just Activision being scummy again"
and i fucking bought it the day before it got on discount:(
sadly ur taking a shit they're never hotfixing it
"Yes they will. While they've been ridiculously lazy, infinity ward still makes a ton of money from mw. I mean the mw3 servers on xbox 360 are still up, even tho thsts technically peer to peer, but even still. They love making money off their old games, and this game isn't even that old! It's got a ton of players, the engine is what warzone uses etc. We aren't talking about a 5+ year old game here.

But activision/iw are being ridiculously lazy with it. I mean this kind of shit needs to be fixed ASAP."
"Possibly, I hope its fixed before that it's been about a week now for some people, for me it only happened the past couple of days.
The part that annoys me is there is no response what so ever from them."
"I don't think the discount has anything to do with it, unfortunately. It was a seasonal thing that they applied to lots of games on Battle.net."
"If I'm not mistaken, daily challenges are different every day for every person. Me and my partner both play and we have different ones
Saying that, I love it when a daily challenge comes up with a charm. I just missed out on the ghostly one before :("
"Oh I think that was something like kill some people affected by concussion? It wasn�t hard challenged whatever it was

Did you see Ghosty show up yet? I really want to get him. I wish there was a webpage that showed what charm challenges were up that day."
"No, I didn't see it, I'm on the lookout too! I don't get on every day tho as I sometimes forget..."
... why would anyone downvote this
[deleted]
So we cannot unlock them extra skins?  Because it was from a different season?
What's so NSFW about this post?
Hot damn! What a skilled trick shot with that aim assist SO SOOOOOO DOPE!
He was using M&K on PC if I remember correctly. I played the next game with him and he is cracked.
Good for you man.
"I think a lot of people bought MW after having already lost faith in CoD a while back. It seemed to offer the promise of a new beginning for the franchise.

Well, the illusion has been well and truly shattered in the past weeks. I'd expect a mass exodus to other FSP titles in the future. Personally, I'm stoked for the next Battlefield."
You can also use new massive team deathmatch on warzone for some quick weapon xp. Its fu*k fest tbh - 48 vs 48 on relatively small maps tho it does its job.
"That's what I've been doing to get my last few levels on some guns, mainly snipers. It actually makes getting the snipers easier than on normal multiplayer, since there's so many enemies you're basically guaranteed kills every match."
"He must have a Vitrazza glass office chair mat.  

Anyone who can drop a grand on a floor mat must have solid skillz."
"I want to download MW again, but it just downright doesn't let me, saying I don't have enough space even though, quite clearly, I have enough space."
OmG bUy It AlReAdY!
XD
"This happened to me not too long ago. The only way around it was to uninstall everything (including the base game) and reinstall. 

.... sorry.

It sucks."
It really does suck. I prefer multiplayer to warzone
[deleted]
"OP is asking for the watch, not the gun."
That�s the watch?  Because that�s the name of the sniper rifle
"Honestly, I don't know what the actual Fuck is going on at IW and Activision."
"Bean counters counting beans would be my guess. 

CW needs to be paid off. MW is already paid off.. why work on the thing that's not costing you money"
All the expenses are going to hookers and cocaine. For them to half-ass all this and sit on content that could get them more money if it was released means they have to be on some shit. /j
"It's not IW's fault, why would IW did so much good on MW19 and let its vastly popular game die.

Talk shit at Activision overlord. There's not a single update on IW's all social media platforms and I follow all of them."
"Sadly I just read this article on ign.

Really disheartening.

"If more people read earnings calls they wouldn't be surprised, the merging of the three bolstered the income of CW immensely"
Where�s your ign so I can apply.
Fuck Cold War. Fuck Activision.
Cold War is terrible and it�s ruining Warzone
Define failing game please.
"Hemorrhaging a fourth of the early adopters already sure isn't healthy, that's for sure."
You guys keep saying this but the people that would have purchased MW probably already have after over a year on the shelf.  But those people are still making $20 micro transactions buying skins they can use in MW and WZ. Activision wouldn�t be one of the biggest gaming companies in the world making stupid financial decisions like that. What�s really probably going on is they didn�t expect WZ to be as big as it is and all the cramming the three games together is breaking shit that they weren�t planning on when the development started on these games a couple years ago.
"Yea i gotta say im really disapointed in this, if this keeps up im done with COD, unless they continue or expand on the MW system which is better in every way than CW than theres really no reason for me to continur with it, i loved COD then gave up on it before after , licked back up with MW and fell in love all over again so"
">failing 

I�m pretty sure it�s the top selling game right now but ok"
And when loads of people get refunds...?
"The [RAAL MG](https://youtu.be/MbOyv91YeQw) is also complete. Still waiting for the proper release, please IW :("
I used it in ground war yesterday from a weapons crate. Unfortunately I got sniped as soon as i got it
While still selling MW in the same price of cold war... the audacity of these mfs..
"I know it's stupid, but that's just the way *Call of Duty* pricing is.

When they're not on sale, *Advanced Warfare* is the newest one that's less than the full launch price on Steam, and even then, it's still not cheap. It's $65 CAD vs $80 CAD. You have to go all the way back to *MW2* and earlier to find any that are less than $40 CAD, and even the oldest ones are still $22 CAD

Here's their current standard prices in CAD, not including DLC (all the games on Steam are on sale for the next couple days though, so if you want to pick any up, now's probably the best time to do it):

- *Call of Duty* - $21.99
- *CoD 2* - $21.99
- *CoD 3* - $21.99
- *CoD 4* - $21.99
- *Modern Warfare Remastered* - $49.99
- *WaW* - $21.99
- *MW2* - $21.99
- *Black Ops* - $43.99
- *MW3* - $43.99
- *BO2* - $64.99
- *Ghosts* - $64.99
- *Advanced Warfare* - $64.99 (Gold Edition. Standard doesn't seem to exist on Steam)
- *BO3* - $79.99
- *Infinite Warfare* - $79.99
- *WWII* - $79.99

On PC, everything newer than *WWII* is only on Battle.net, and other than *Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered*, which costs $26.99, they all cost $79.99 for the standard editions"
MW is over a year old. The game is dead. Get over it.
"> The game is dead.

Weird, I don't remember sitting in a loading screen with ""Waiting for more players"" in Modern Warfare, ever. I do seem to remember that happening more times than not in Cold War."
"The point is that it's not dead or dying, its being killed on purpose, and it would make more money with less overhead by not being killed and replaced."
"It�ll come out. Say what you want, but Activision knows what they�re doing when it comes to making money. I�m sure they�re just waiting for a window where it�ll be most beneficial to them, given that they seem to be pushing Cold War pretty hard."
"if you really wanna get xp grind plunder if you do alot of contracts you will get a good bit of xp, thats what if been doing atleast"
Play a different game
Good idea
"Play plunder you can get xp there, thank me later"
I don�t play Warzone
"Okay, but you can play the game and these issues like no xp and hit markers are like 0.05% of the actual gameplay. But, you are filling up your diaper over it? It might be time to log off and embrace more of the real world. Your level of immersion has become unhealthy."
I appreciate you saying that just in case though tbh
"Lmao wtf I haven�t played the game in 8 months I just started playing again, literally barely any time a day, whatever I can squeeze in to my schedule, and not progressing in that very limited window of time is really frustrating and that�s why I got unhappy. Don�t try to sound like a philosopher with no facts to back your claim, just by randomly accusing someone, literally I just made you whole argument irrelevant with the first 3 sentences of this answer."
If you wanna fast track your way through the first challenge I�d put it on a LMG and play a few rounds of shipment
"Thank you, thats exactly what Im aiming for. How about am I to do that please? Is there any secret way to get to play shipment only? As far as Im aware the rotation is quite randon right?"
"You can progress with your reticle challenge with any weapon, provided that you can slap a scope on it"
Why you crouch walking everywhere lmao
I thought there was someone at the top and was trying to stay down ig lol. Kept hearing someone running around but didn�t have my headset and thought they were on top rather than behind and I don�t ever watch the mini.
Your to slow lol. Walking up like that no wonder you got killed lmaoo
"Hey, I never said I was good at the game lol"
The guy you DONT want on your team.
He definitely jumped out the window and ran around through the door and got behind you; or were never up there
"Real talk has anyone else been witnessing enemies actually disappear?? Like they aren�t glitching the game just makes them be there then literally go away then be there again. I was playing ground war fighting a sniper at medium distance and his head was all I could see and it kept cutting him on and off my screen, he was NOT crouching/proning and standing up again because I would see him drop or rise. He just was there then he wasn�t. Happened multiple times with multiple players"
I�ve noticed it a handful of times yeah.
Omae wa mou shindeiru
"I'm going for Rodion too, I've tried it in MP and Warzone + Rumble, it's just not tracking, for multiple operators too, I'm guessing it's just another bug like XP right now"
"Same problem here. At first I thought it was something like ""get 15 kills -> in one game <-"" but I did it multiple times in multiplayer and it didn't work."
"Thoughts on this y�all? Every time I try to pop on survival it shows me this. I have all the packs downloaded but cannot figure out where the survival pack is. I�ve played survival before but it�s been a minute. It just says the store is unavailable after the second prompt

ETA: I do have both spec ops packs. I just don�t think it�s the same thing as the survival pack."
"Acti wants MW to die. Move people to Cold War

Thats how this cycle has worked for 15 years, unfortunately

If we get post launch content, we're definitely not getting until CW is 6 months old"
Its sad that they do that so long time.... But I just don't think that many people get interested in cw. Like me.
Cold war sucks i bought them sold it after I finished the campaign. Multiplayer felt like a cartoon.
"I dont know why everyone is suddenly so pissed off that they arent supporting mw anymore once cold war is out. As if every other call of duty that came out is still being supported with content. It happens every year. The new cod releases, then they start to work on their next game. It's been happening for 17 years. You're not used to it?"
Did you see the thread about contacting senators about it lol this sub has lost its fucking mind.
I just expected something better than what we've gotten ig
"Fuck, never read something so fucking dumb in my life, its not about the new game you dumbass its about putting out a patch that wouldn't even take two days to fix, so people can go back to playing the game."
"There are like 15 fully finished bundles in the files, which include new guns. New maps are also finished. They�re not just going to scrap them, especially considering that the bundles are fully complete and useable (there are YouTube videos of them). Just be patient."
"I'm just more confused if anything, I get that they want to focus on CW sales and I would be surprised if the three guns we know if are all we get but like we know they're in the game, just drop them idk maybe I'm outta pocket"
"I get it, but I'll just be happy if they keep the game running smoothly (fix the fucking weapon xp). They've moved on to cold war, fine fair enough. But you aren't alone in playing mw, more people are sticking with MW than cold war. It's honestly the best cod I've played since Bo2 and the most fun I've had since mw2. If they just fix the xp bugs I'd be happy, there's already a lot of content tbf"
"I love the game but it's hard to play dom, hp, and snd using the same shit all the time I just want something it doesn't even have to be like like some meta breaking gun just gimme something man"
Why exactly would they care? The franchise has moved on to the next cycle. I think you guys need to work on your acceptance
I think u need to suck a dick
"They unlocked the Makarov, Skorpion and SIG MG to use in Survival

And they added a bunch of free to all Operators Uniform !"

It doesn't matter. Tweets won't fix incompetence.
at least it could show them people still care about this game and it needs an urgent fix
I think your priority of bug fixes and their priorities of new content and cosmetics aren't the same.
true
"It won�t fix it. Weapon XP is working in Warzone and Plunder still, but isn�t in MW."
that�s so stupid. everything works but multiplayer huh
Agreed
"No. IW is doing MW. Raven made WZ using MW/IW engine and using MW game assests. 

When CW came out, raven ported CW content to WZ engine and will continue to maintain and evolve WZ by porting new stuff from other future CODs:

IW is making MW2.

The start of my original account was on PS4 and then transferred to PC.

Also, I had that activision account I believe since Call of Duty Elite was a thing, I got old old emails lol

edit: I guess the start of my account would've been for CoD Elite, not the ps4 thing."
It works in warzone but not in mw
Ah okay. That's shitty then. I thought I'd share this to help out others but I guess it's just Activision gutting Modern Warfare multiplayer or perhaps a mistake on Infinity Wards part during one of the patches I guess
"this has nothing to do with the bug, it's only in multiplayer and it's not fixed."
Yeah I just found that out. I'll take down the post as to not confuse or spread false hope. Was just trying to help people as I wasn't aware this was a multiplayer specific issue
"EDIT: Apparently due to a bug weapons can only be ranked up in Warzone now, not multiplayer. Sorry for the misleading title everyone, just wanted to try and help :(

For those trying to rank up weapons for camo grinding, I suggest going into plunder trios alone and doing a bunch of supply runs and scavenger contracts. Fastest way to level up guns without needing to actually play Warzone if you're not a fan of it."
"I'd like they bring back the 12v12 playlist on all maps and modes. (Yes from Rust, Shoot House and Shipment, to Aniyah, Grazna, Euphrates and Arklov Dam)"
10v10 is one of the deader modes and i wouldn't be surprised that a party of 10 wanting to do it just doesn't exist. just how many people that can join 9 friends for some Euphrates Bridge action do you think are out there?
I�ve got a group like that right now
"Some people have friends.   
And you can make friends on Discord, Reddit, Forums, and even directly in the play lobby.  
I made like 50's of friends just by good gameplay and openly interacting.  
I for one could actually fill a private BR server with friends  
If you want to join just upvote or reply me"
"Agreed, 6 person limit seems dumb

It might be a hold-over from when the game didn't separate 10v10 and 6v6, though that was changed very quickly after launch so idk."
"Some operators have challenges to do and other encourage you to buy a bundle. But for battle pass specific skins, no"
"You want that Roze skin don't you? No way to get it now. 

I would like to get season 2 Ghost skin myself."
"I'm not against BP exclusives, but find it slightly jarring that you can't unlock certain operators at all now. It would have made more sense (IMO) for the exclusives to be unique skins rather than the operator itself."
"every operator says exactly what will unlock it. you cant purchase past battlepasses so that's out. it will be either an in-game challenge or you have to buy any skin for that operator. for example i didn't play during season 1 so Mara is still locked for me unless i buy a skin, but she was free with the season 1 BP."
And with the lawsuit you'll probably never have Mara lol
"The other issues seems related to your hardware dude.  
Also change your audio settings from Boost/Midnight Mode to something more decent, that doesn't crush the audio dynamic range."
Ngl hearing those airstrikes in my first match is one of the things that made me love this game. They sound so awesome
This almost happened to me with my fortnut account it kept saying some dude was logging in to my epic games account and he even unlinked my Xbox and PS4 account and linked his own. Luckily I was faster and was able to unlink his account and change my password so now he can suck a nut
"Hey there - first off, I�m glad to hear you got your account back! That makes me a little more hopeful for my situation. I�m in a similar boat right now (lost access to my account somehow, fairly sure it was hacked). How exactly did you go about contacting support? I seem to be striking out as far as finding a working phone number goes, and their ticketing system has only sent auto-generated emails to me from a no-reply email address.

Unfortunately I don�t have many/any photos or clips of the account or gameplay, so I�m not sure how much additional evidence I can provide them with. I do have the email I received when I created my Activision/COD account, so hopefully that gets me somewhere. 

Anyway, sorry to ramble, but thanks for sharing your experience! I�m just hoping there�s more I can do to get my account back."
You should check on cod stats if your account is being used to hack because most likely it will get accidentally banned by a rolling ban from activision. There is a support chat (https://support.activision.com/results-page?g=Call%20of%20Duty%3A%20Black%20Ops%20Cold%20War&pt=Xbox%20Series%20X%7CS&t=COD%20Points%20and%20Battle%20Pass&i=I�m%20missing%20an%20item%20I%20bought%20in%20the%20Store) which is a game changer. I tried contacting through social media but that was a dead end. The email would be a good photo to submit. Make sure to show the date in the email. If you need anything else I can answer more
So wait you�re telling me they can unban? Lol Microsoft is pathetic
"Yep, I had a few support agents that told me my account was permanently banned and there was no appeal system but once I got a support agent who understood my situation they were able to create a case number for me to check out if I was hacking while the account was in my possession or the hackers"
Yes
im glad im not the only one. I couldn't find anyone one else talking about this and though it was just me
Yep get a 'dev error' crash every so often when joining a match!
"Do you have On-Demand Texture Streaming enabled in the graphics options? If so, turn it off and see if the problem's fixed."
"Crashes a few times a day for me. 

Usually a dev error. My frames also drop to 50-70 a lot, when I normally get 170+."
do you have LGHUB?
"Yeah I've been having problems with modern warfare for a while. No matter what I do, even disabling texture streaming and reinstalling shaders and everything, the game still crashes. It's been irritating since I've not been able to finish a single game since the beginning of the previous season"
"I changed settings till VRAM wasn't red, made it DirectX11, let windows use more Virtual memory. Nothing worked till I cleaned my Hardrive. Didnt have a crash at all today. Cleaning the SSD might have fixed it for me.

My guess is that it might have been using too much ram, and when RAM usage was 100%, it might have started using the hardrive as temporary storage.. when the Hardrive got full, it could have crashed. But I have 32 gb ram lol. Warzone is so badly optimized I think this could still be a possibility."
"Also, oh, Sparks was on Shadow Company.... Interesting"
"Something is seriously wrong with the lighting when Soap is looking straight. Feels like all his side hair disappears

I like his Mohawk haircut when seen from the side, but through the front, something looks really wrong


*Thank God in game it looks way better*"
He looks way better everywhere else besides the operator menu
"""Known as a perpetual FNG, a label he wears as a badge of honor."" Damn it's been years I'm so emotional rn."
Is that a glitch or did you do that yourself on pc?
I found these on twitter from a dataminer
Isn�t soap supposed to be a marksman rather than a cqb expert ? His role was mostly sniper missions
I think they might�ve forgotten to add it (it did mention he was a cqb and marksman expert in his bio when first found in the files too so)
How I can read this
"Sparks is a traitor, he goes with Shepherd then he returns to the Marines and THEN he kills Ghost"
"???

The fuck you on about"
"I've just always prefered IW cod's to Treyarch, the aim feels different. I think MW was a step towards the old golden age of cod, I feel like blackops while it can be fun is too much effort to get people interested."
"MW is everything I wanted back when I was playing cod4. More tactical, more realistic, vantage points and doors, but playing it I also realized some of these things don't really work well with a casual arcade shooter, but it's still a lot of fun to play it and I'm glad the devs tried a lot of these things out and I hope they polish these things out for the next mw"
"I have it, regret it. And now refuse to play that substandard game. My ass went to destiny again."
It was so bad I took a break from gaming. A month long break
That is a no for me. Warzone and modern warfare multiplayer is fine for me.
"Treyarch is the weakest of the three CoD developers, IMO. 

Zombies mode is trash, Black Ops continuity is fucking terrible, come at me."
Are you seriously saying you prefer Sledgehammer over Treyarch?
CW could be free but I seriously doubt I'd ever play it again. No way I'm ever spending money on it.
"zombies is fun af,and campaign is fun other than that multiplayer is bad"
"A touch of fresh air, a game on which you can really move through the map without getting insta killed by a corner camper who heard you coming from the other part of the map. The contrast with MW 2019 makes it feel even better."
"I would appreciate the option �Got it, Mistakes made�. 

It�s sorta fun, just not what I want."
My friend bought it on release and we are gamesharing.
The game is a good example of how rushing a game and using ways that encourage you to buy microtransactions has consequences which punishes the COD community
If I DID want to get it I would buy it used on EBay so none of my money goes to Activision�s coffers. Didn�t like them much before they ruined MW and I really don�t like them now.
I'd buy it for maybe 50/60% off just for zombies
"What is cold war?, is it a game or something?"
"Bought it on sale, played MP for a bit, wasn't feeling it at all. TTK is too long for my liking (I've played BO4 and I do much better on that for some reason so I'm not biased about MW). Everything just feels off about it. The game made me miss MW so I went back to this instead. Much more enjoyable, even though SBMM is still in the game."
I bought it and got it refunded on the same day
"I bought cold war during the month where warzone and was unplayable because of the DMR.  Zombies is fun, MP is just your generic Treyarch fare. Not much different to BO2-4, just kinda bland and unsatisfying. If I didn't have MW I'd probably play it, but MW is just better in every way. 

Haven't had time for the campaign yet but I'll play it soon"
Cold War just feels like a C list knockoff version of MW
I have Cold War and regret buying it.  I've moved back to modern warfare after 9hrs game time lol
"Haha you mean the game that looks like it belongs on last gen consoles? Whose development was rushed during a global pandemic so that it could still be released before the end of the year? The game that looks like a knock-off MW, but with dumbed down gameplay? The game that Activision is trying to kill MW2019 for?  


Nah, fuck that game. Never buying it."
"I pre-ordered (sadly) CW. I thought the zombies mode was the best zombies mode that Treyarch has released, but fell short on the multiplayer. I don't think it deserves all of the bad shit that it gets on this subreddit. And for some reason, I feel like this sub would've just been like ""meh, bad game but I don't really care"" if it hadn't been forcefully integrated into MW."
"I played the demo, not that impressed with it so not bothering with it."
"I bought Cold War full price on the PlayStation store and then the next day it was 25% off so I guess you could say I got fingered.

Then my wife bought me MW for Christmas which is infinitely better and I haven�t touched CW since. Just started my grind for Damascus! 

For reference, was F2P in Warzone since season 3 - was really happy with MW until last week when they broke it."
"Nope, these nazis are pretending there�s an XP bug to get us to buy this shit. Also I�ll never spend another penny again because the company and game is backed by communist and Nazis who are engaged in genocide."
"Welp, that escalated quickly."
r/modernwarfare moment
"I got CW to play it with a friend, and god i can barely think of anything it did better."
"I had some fun on CW but that�s because of I was using someone else�s account that has the battlepass on Xbox, giving easier lobbies, but no way I would buy a copy of it for pc, especially since CW has some more gameplay fundamental issues"
Logically I would think the casuals always play the newest games while those who still play the older games likely due so bc they like it more and or are better at it
the playerbase is shrinking so you'll be more likely to go against good players
"If you�ve always gotten top 3, it means they were consistently matching you up with players worse than you. Now, they�re matching you up against players that are around your skill level, so sometimes you�ll get top3, sometimes you�ll be in the middle, and sometimes you�ll get bottom 3."
"> sometimes you�ll get bottom 3

I'm normally in the bottom three    :("
"I don't think so, i got 43 - 7 with crossbow on domination yesterday"
The matchmaking algorithm of MW and CW are exactly the same...
That is shitty man!! Weapon xp has been broke for over a week now
"Wow you think they would hotfix that or have an announcement in game or disable tokens...

1 whole week is crazy."
"big oof. I tend to actually check weapon levels between games to see how it's going. you cannot get weapon XP in multiplayer.

on a positive note tomorrow starts a double xp weekend, so you can have like 100 hours worth of 2X tokens for nothing.

Play plunder solo and just do contracts (supply run and recon). that levels your weapons faster than anything else even when MP wasn't bugged.

you can also watch the CDL tourney this weekend and get a few hours worth of tokens as reward."
Double xp or double weapon xp?
"None of my guns are leveling either, 200 kills today with the m14 and I�ve gone from level 37 1023/1700 to level 37 1031/1700"
"No offense dude but how did you not notice your weapon wasn�t ranking up after about 10 minutes?

The sign that your weapon has leveled up pops up right in the center of your screen"
I haven�t played mw since like november and i noticed after a few games then tried different modes
I know this is off topic but is there gonna be new modern-warfare content ?
"Probably not, they have the guns in file and you can use them in spec ops but not in mp. Its shitty"
Uninstall and reinstall game. Will fix the bug.
proof?
I have the same problem??!!! Can�t get any xp!!
Triple A game producers everybody!
According to support they are looking into it. I told them its been 7 days and still nothing is ridiculous
"Ok I�ve been noticing a bunch of people having this problem, myself included. My problem is with the PILA. I�m getting some xp but it�s not adding up, maybe like 20 per match"
"Yes, I had that issue a day ago, but now it�s just not giving me any xp, I have checked my classes after every game, where I have shot down at least two things a game, and it�s still at 480 xp."
"My Xp was getting fucked around a week ago when I noticed I was getting like 9xp for an assist and 50xp for a kill, I didn�t think that eventually I would be getting none smh"
Oh man. My account got hacked a few months ago when I was like 3 challenges from Damascus. Read enough online saying don�t bother trying to get any help with the matter. So I stopped worrying and never looked back. Life is better without this kinda bs
"Don�t believe everything this sub says, my account got hacked as well a few months ago, and it was recovered in 5 days.  Also I personally, nor anyone I play with, have been affected by the no xp or hit markers thing."
"Wish I took heed of these posts earlier, my acc just got hacked earlier this week (RIP Damascus, all season passes, Cold War, etc) and have yet to hear anything back from Activision.

I'll likely be doing the same as you and just straight up quitting, I've had enough of this shit."
"I�ve been surprisingly lucky to not be hit with any hacking bullshit but this week is keeping me on edge. I love this game (I truly do) but if they don�t fix this shit by next week, I�m going to uninstall"
I�m playing warzone rumble to get the XP since it�s working on there.
"same, I'm tryng to level my galil and RAM but it's always stuck at 1349 XP for RAM and 243 XP for galil.
It's so annoying"
I somehow unlocked platinum camo for all my smgs
The store changes every few weeks
"It�s not even under the uzis blueprints, which it usually would go to after it was in the store"

where were you looking, Ask Jeeves?

There are almost 20 weapon XP posts in this sub's new tab, and the top post on the frontpage is about weapon xp (along with about a dozen other posts on the hot tab). There are 100s of posts about it in the past week, which is when the bug started.

If you want to level weapons until the bug is fixed you have to do warzone, and if you want to do it fast do contracts in Plunder."
">There are almost 20 weapon XP posts in this sub's new tab, and the top post on the frontpage is about weapon xp (along with about a dozen other posts on the hot tab). 

Does this sub not have mods? The bugs should be pinned to the subs front page."
I always play plunder. Battle royale gives barely xp. In plunder I get 2-3 times not xp.
oh shit my bad i guess i was just looking on google and not here...
"XP was broken on last Thursday's update, well known."
"Ok I�m getting xp for the pila, it�s just astronomically slow. I just made a post about it too lol. Idk what�s going on I hope we get help"
"Nah I mean somethings bugged, maybe try another class to see if it�s just subs"
I'm not getting any XP whatsoever on the P90 or the Uzi. Should I try weapons in a different class? Or more submachine guns?
Try co-op online see if u get any xp. It worked for me but it�s long and boring to play co-op.
"ATTENTION: I'm making it my mission to post to Twitter and/or Instagram on Raven, Activision, Activsupport (whatever they are),  COD plus the Gamer ezines Twits too about how fucking broken MW 2019 is and WHY isn't anyone fixing it or paying attention.  

Post to social media because they value that more than the numerous support tickets we put in and NEVER get the promised email!     Promote this hashtag on all their posts :

"Yeah, I�m not getting any XP for the AS Val either, thought it was just me, and I�m on PC"
Is there something on the official activision or call of duty websites we can do? Or complain or something? I gather that'd be a super waste of time because they're so done with Modern Warfare and leaving it uncompleted....
"Yeah, they appear to me"
So can I play the game if I download them ?
I just wanted to kill the tower campers :(
"I think it would be cool to also put launchers in gunsmith. Heat seeking reticles, customizable payloads (Anti Air, Anti Armor and Anti Personnel) Maybe a few ""less than lethal"" options with more ammunition."
I want to see a perk with same function from WWII called �Saboteur� that shortens the fuse on anything explosive
"I think it'd be nice to be able save blueprints and add/switch optics on launchers like for RPG7 and CG.  
But I think throwables with different camos/etc are too much. It's not a eye-candy party. I don't want it to be a gaudy ostentatious show"
">Perhaps the MODs will sticky this 

They're sooner to remove this post. 

>/r/ModernWarfare is the developer-supported, community-run subreddit for the Modern Warfare community.

Dev supported. AKA The devs are in control of this sub"
When was the last time anybody affiliated with MW even visited the sub though
"And likely you can take it to any of your choice of game journalists for censorship. That can put Activision on the radar as well, may not change anything but at least you tried."
"If it's the MW devs, then we should have a good two weeks before this gets taken down."
"of course it is, after 400 upvotes my thread, where i was talking about the xp bug just got deleted"
Lets wallstreetbets this motherfucker
Lmaoooo... let�s get it!
"I think a main challenge with this is most people in the FTC are still trying to figure out how to use flip phones.

""I can't earn XP in my video game anymore"" will probably sound like ancient Aramaic to them."
Complaining to the FTC is like pissing in a bucket and tossing it into the ocean to get back at a fish who told you he fucked your mom over Xbox live game chat in 2008
"�A mandatory update that removes and/or breaks a lot of functionality was pushed to last year�s product, which I believe was done to incentivise purchasing this year�s, since in that version, all functionality is in tact� should be understandable, I feel.

Besides, the actual complaint isn�t as important as the volume."
"Thank you for this, I did file a complaint. If you plan to do so aswell and are wondering what to write as complaint, this is what I wrote:

""After buying their game twice (for different platforms) the game is now (since around December 2020) rapidly losing support by the developer (Activision). This complaint is one of many, either on this site or through different media. After paying this sum of money it should not be innapropriate to expect transparancy and acknowledgement by this company regarding the many problems that their product is facing. They are leaving the games' community without answers and no support for various issues regarding loss of access to the accounts that have been paid for as an example. The positive experiences that buyers have with this product are declining due to the many unadressed problems while the developers are taking a very passive stand towards all of this."""
"What's going on here isn't the same as what went on with other Call of Duty games. This isn't an issue of the game no longer getting content made for it, and the player base dying off. That's what happened with Modern Warfare - Ghosts. (I speak of these games as they are what I have the most experience with)

The issue here feels like Modern Warfare 2019, now called Warzone, is being forced into obsolescence, with the intent of ""upgrading"".

On PC, this started off as the advertisement for Cold War being larger than the portion of the window for the game that people purchased. Personally, I thought this was in bad taste, seeing how there was no lacking information regarding the upcoming release of Cold War, but whatever.

Next, the in game advertisements because a large portion of what was seen. This was annoying, and I personally felt it was pretty crappy of them, but whatever.

That is followed up by the name of the game being changed, and 1/3 of the main menu is taken up by a game that is unplayable. During this period, the Battle Pass season goes from what would have been 7 to Season 1, and the content in this battle pass isn't even for the game in which people purchased it from... While I am not a lawyer, this would fit under my definition of fraud and accepting money under false pretenses.

If the previous stuff wasn't enough, this game suddenly gets an update which more or less removes the ability to unlock items in this game, and match making has started to feel as if it's been manipulated to the point of frustrating the player base into ""upgrading"".

It's started to feel like going throw a bad break up with a desperate ex. What's next? Is there going to  be threats that if we don't buy their new ""upgrade"", they will sell our personal information and/or use any personal information on our accounts to make the transaction for us? This has gone beyond petty marketing and bad business practices."
"Thing is, some of what you've listed is a problem in a Cold War as well though.

- 2/3 of the main menu are for a completely seperate game (Let's not forget MW and Warzone ARE the same game.) So it feels like they're trying to get you to play anything that isn't what you've chosen, regardless of what you've chosen.

- The matchmaking in Cold War is almost exactly the same as Modern Warfare, if not worse to the point where it stops you wanting to play.

The problem with any legal issues they might have had with the battle pass is that they can say ""It does work for Modern Warfare"" and in one way, it does. Most if not all the content works in Warzone which is part of Modern Warfare. Not to mention them rebranding MW as Warzone.

The main difference between what they're doing now and what they used to do, is they essentially forced their own hand. By attaching Warzone to Modern Warfare in such a core embedded way, they've made it extremely difficult for themselves. If Modern Warfare and Warzone were seperate, my guess is they would've left MW like they traditionally do but since they can't update Warzone without updating MW they've shot themselves in the foot.

They've bitten off far more than they can chew and it's only going to get worse as more games release. 

What are they gonna do when they release a new game with new weapons and operators? Add MORE into Warzone? Further breaking the fragile weapon balance that currently exists or are they gonna start removing stuff, which will cause them MORE hassle due to people having bought stuff like cosmetics and blueprints. 

Their focus on Warzone is likely gonna be what loses Call Of Duty a lot of their playerbase"
You think they�d actually respond for a mere game?
"I think infinity ward has no say in what is going on with THEIR game, i think it's all Activision. in my opinion, there is only ONE problem with the entire game of Modern Warfare 2019, forget SBMM, forget the matchmaking, forget the battle passes, forget Warzone, forget Cold War, and as hard as it is, forget the hackers. the only problem with Modern Warfare 2019 is...

that it is TOO GOOD.

i could keep playing MW2019 for years, everything,from all the work they put:

\- in the new engine (go ahead and compare cod ghosts with this,) , 

\-the animations, the feel when walking, running, sprinting, sliding, reloading

\-the sound design (yeah footsteps suck sometime but still) ,

\- the exact amount of nostalgia with old maps like rust, vacant, shipment, you all got goosebumps loading a match in these maps for the first time in years, no other modern cod gave you chills like this, fuck outta here with nuketown or raid from black ops.

\-the campaign, while not groundbreaking, was exciting and great globetrotting fun with the man himself, captain price.

\-i think there's a difference between being a hater, and WANTING to be a hater, and the internet just wanted to hate MW2019 for so long, that's why everyone bitches about nonsense, that's why it attracts assholes who cheat in multiplayer, because everyone wants a piece of it, but they can't bring it down, it's too good.

\-so the only entity that can truly fuck them over is Activision, because they own the thing, no one in there has the balls to stop making a new game just for a year, so this great experience that is MW2019 can breathe and truly reach it's potential. they're too greedy too much enslaved to shareholders, so treyarch had to step in the middle of the development of cod 2020 and shit out this clearly inferior experience because it wasn't looking good to begin with.

\-i bet the top dogs at infinity ward are looking at this entire shit show with a smile, no because of how Activision has butchered their baby, but because they know they're the fucking best, these guys created COD they KNOW what works and what it needs. i wish i could buy them and let them do whatever the fuck they wanted.

\-sorry, i just really like this fucking game, that is all. i'll go back to not earning a fucking thing in multiplayer, bye."
"I agree and disagree somewhat. I think the general experience improved when it comes to gameplay, but the game feels like I have far less control over my performance personally. I feel like I am being manipulated I feel like its pure coinflip oftentimes wether I win 1v1 gunfight even vs console players...

And the movement well, its cool to slide around n shit but the sprint to fire speed is so retarded slow that you literally can't rush around the map with all the mobility you got properly because anytime a camper sees you you WILL die. Even if you see him just as quick because he didn't sprint, he starts firing first and he WILL win the fight. In older cods I felt far more capable in dealing with campers and sweaty ass players with just pure aim and reaction time and still did fairly well in a game full of sweaters and campers. In this game, I feel unable to deal even with console player campers lol as a fricking PC player. If the lobby is sweaty I go 0.3 KDA lol  


In older cods I got positive KDA in literally every single match in which I didn't quickscope or meet an aimbot."

"Don't think it will help, they will have 1000s of lawyers. Probably saying that the update had lots of bugs and requires work."
I don�t understand how they thought Cold War looked better than mw it�s a joke really
"I'm torn on this subject, Im hoping it's an honest mistake. But Seeing Activisions track record lately makes believe this ""sabotage"" scenario is plausible. Regardless of what it is they still havent acknowledged the issues nor is there any sign of a fix coming. If they think they can take our money and behave this way they are sorely mistaken. Large companies and corporations need to be kept in check other wise this behavior will only get worse down the line"
"I still lean towards incompetence. I don't think they're able to make bug free games anymore, especially during a pandemic."
I'd rather go after Treyarch for the abysmal CW launch
"Blame activision for that, Treyarch had a whole year less time for development due to activision rushing them."
This is fucking stupid.
"Hey, I found the Dev"
"Upvoted and filed a formal complaint. 

Thanks for creating this thread."
your welcome
Is this post a satire?
"From edgy kids? Pretty sure, yes. This sub can't think straight anymore..."
Right lol
"Probably only me but the only maps I get in quick play 6v6 rotation are Euphrates bridge, grazna raid , gun runner and st Petrograd."
Are you on pc or console? I havent seen euphrates bridge in 6v6 in about 6 months.
Haven�t seen Euphrates Bridge for months actually. Thought they removed it due to complaints.
"I can't say I'm too hopeful this will succeed in all honesty but you have my best wishes! I hope I'm wrong and this at least acts as the boot in the ass they need. I honestly think it's unlikely that Activision/IW are **actively sabotaging** Modern Warfare. Perhaps I am just easily offput by conspiracy-type stuff, but I definitely think they are at the least severely neglecting (knowingly and uncaringly) the game and taking its player-base for granted."
They are absolutely creating bugs in MW to coerce people into buying CW. It's complete and utter bullshit that we can't earn XP anymore on MW going on 2 weeks now without Activision addressing the problem. I hope they get fucked hard and people find out what this company is really about (making shitloads of cash from consumers). They shove the battle pass fuckery down my throat after every few matches I finish. With no option to select  *don't show me this again*. Greedy mothercuckers.
"Finally! I remember being a laughing stock of BFV subred when I propose same thing against DICE/EA. People forget they should demand quality of the products they consume, instead forming a cult around lead dev�s Twitter accounts."
"The only thing posting feedback on this subreddit does is get you harassed and messaged for months about ""keep crying."" So yeah, the devs and fanboys are sooner to try to lynch you over actually helping."
"im annoyed too guys but lets be serious, this isnt going anywhere"
Any tips on how we categorize this?
We have to do this!
"This is the dumbest shit Ive seen yet on this sub. It's a game bro. Step back take a break. The shit they broke will be fixed in time. Sure it sucks it hasnt been fixed yet, I'd love to level the amax I finally decided to try and unlock. But if you think any formal board is going to look at this like a case youre nuts man."
"Bro, when you earn the money you pay to purchase your games, you will understand. Until then - ask your dad about consumer protection rights."
Do people really care this much?
If people let this happen it will only get worse & more widespread in the future
I bought the game and now the updates for this game are not only for a different game but the updates are also breaking this game.
Yes
I paid 10 dollars for a battle pass that has no mw guns. Its completely unethical what they are doing.
I do
"And reported! If we get this going and a few hundred more complaints we might actually have a chance of changing something

Edit; who the fuck downvoted this"
"They also falsely ban people, never tell you why. They changed the game I bought to something I haven't bought and advertised Cold War so much.

I paid for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019. Campaign, Multiplayer and Spec Ops and not Warzone. When I open the game I want to see Modern Warfare and not Warzone.

I got randomly banned after I downloaded some update...I never used cheats, the only things I used that probably got them to ban me was the discord hook or the performance monitor from MSI Afterburner. Or they also ban people who insult other players which that I can understand, I did call other people idiots and what not. They never told me why is my problem.

I wasted 60$ and they a future customer. I'm not buying Cold Warn, I'm not going to pay for an unban."
"I'm tired of St. petrograd, Azhur cave, and all the other dumpster fire maps, just bring back shoot the ship"
Challenge stills bugged.
Did they finally add it to MP or is it still only for spec ops edit* I�m dumb it shows specs ops
"I fell for this shit right at launch of the season. I was mad as hell. People talk shit on not reading but in all honesty at LEAST we would expect some content or camos for MODERN WARFARE, the game WE FUCKING BOOT UP to play.

Shit was vague as hell from the start and I dont blame you for falling to this trap. If only I would had taken my time to read the fine print then I would definetely not have bought this shit pass. I DONT GIVE A DAMN about warzone since day 1. Yet here I got to sit through 1 hour and a half updates for a gamemode I NEVER play, yet it breaks my entire experience with the shit hole bugs it adds"
Exactly bro! I don�t play warzone at all just a waste of time I�ve been killed last few times from people with aimbot shooting me miles away
"Don't mind the Activision apologists. Yeah this post ""again"" because you're not the only one who thinks this is pure horseshit.

I'd say just play through the BP and get your CP back but with the current bug of no in-game XP, no weapon XP, and Battle Pass progression moving at the speed of trickle-down economics, you'll have to spend all of that time in Warzone instead of multiplayer."
Thanks bro lol I literally have never posted on here and was surprised how people just jumped to defend this. I had 900 from a long time ago so bought 1000 and the BP and already have enough fir the next one like you were saying.
"Late to the post (9 days LOL) but I agree. I do not buy battle passes until I get far enough in it that I get my CP back. So I am still rocking the initial $10 I put in a long time ago. But I agree, I was shocked how little content there was for MW. I knew some of it was for CW but damn, wasn't expecting almost all of it. 

Kind of pathetic IMO. Let's give you crap for a game you are not playing. They are assuming you will buy CW since you've already unlocked crap. SMDH."
"oh hey it's this post again.

the only thing this proves is that you are dumb enough to buy a battle pass that ends in less than 2 weeks, and too dumb to read the BP descriptions that CLEARLY state what each of the 100 rewards is for.

congratulations, i guess."
Damn never seen a more fitting name you mong. Sorry I don�t live on MW Reddit to notice this post �again�. And dumb? It�s $10 I won�t be missing that just keep doing your chores and save for the next battle pass. Chances are you play mainly Cold War now cause you�re tired of being shit on in MW.
Damn don't need to call me out for the first one lol
"Fuck outta here.

Calling someone dumb for expecting a battle pass that they bought in their game to actually work for the game they bought it in?

Fuck

Outta

Here"
"I mean it was heavily implied that the battle pass was Cold War and Warzone only but go ahead, downvote idk"
Casual cod player bro just saw a  style pass on a game and got it. Maybe it was implied somewhere but I didn�t see where bro.
"You mad bro?
-16 year olds on cod that don't think before they speak"
Idk if you tryna talk shit but if you are you�re not doing it well by signing your comment as a 16yr old..
Probably a new feature. Lose xp and get booted. Makes the game more challenging. Some may say its a bit much. Hardcore gamers think of it as a cakewalk.
"I am having the same issue. My dad and I always play splitscreen and since the update 9/10 times we get a blue screen back to the menu.

I thought it was an issue with his account since we recently swapped main ps4s but this confirms is the damn game"
it's the game. 95% of my playing time is split screen with my wife and I'd say on average we spend 15-20 min out of the night just trying to actually start a match.
Mine has been doing the same thing! One player is fine but as soon as we try split screen it crashes the game. Reinstalled the game but no success
"We've tried everything, with no success. It's on the devs."
"I�m hoping they�ll address it soon. Playing solo is okay but with split screen, it crashes and puts us back to the Xbox menu."
Me too. Driving me insane. I would expect a smaller to have some occasional issues but this is ridiculous.
"I ran into this at around 5pm PST.

As far as I could tell it was only a first person issue. 

My squad mates said they didn't see anything abnormal about my operator. 

I will make an update if it happens again. 

Have you encountered the Texture Glitch recently?"
It's a new feature
Lol
My wife after not playing for months was at level 95. She should had been set to level 55. Did Warzone 100% reset when Cold War dropped?
Yes actually. No joke. They ripped away everyone's level progression and reset everyone to level 1.
Good luck bud. Mines been gone since September. Some times it�s better to move on. They don�t give af.
"Keep trying. I lost my account sometime shortly after my birthday in July. It took me two weeks of constantly contacting support, but one day I got on and my account was back."
I�m sensing aggravation.
"Yeah, I'm fucking pissed"
"My account almost got hacked into, luckily I had the blizzard authenticator so my account was fine. 

People, please make sure to secure your accounts, Activision doesn't give half a flying fuck about you, and their ""Support site"" is a site filled with Activision ""Ambassadors"" which are basically just mw players that want a in-game camo. 

The people you're talking to on the support website are not even affiliated with Activision and dont know jack about how to fix your issue."
I got my account hacked a year ago and they were pretty prompt I'm restoring it. Less than a day or two. Hopefully they fix it and it should make all your stuff 2 factor authentication from now on.
"Last year when Cold War wasn't out, I guess.."
They don�t call it Microtransactivision for no reason
"did you have that 2 factor authentication thing. im just wondering if you still got hacked into even with it, cus that would be crazy"
I�ve seen plenty of people who have had that and we�re still hacked. Just saying don�t expect it to be an impenetrable firewall.
"No, I didnt, but that was cause most of all the accounts I make on a site/game ive never had hacked into, so I never had a real reason to have it active. it is now though, and id like to remove this fake account from my Activison account so I can relink my personal account so I can continue playing."
"The sad truth is they don't care because they can afford to not care. This, like many, many other problems the player base has are not significant enough for them to do anything about because the solution to that problem will cost them more money than doing nothing. This is modern corporate gaming (i.e. EA, Activision, 2K)"
"I hate to say this to you, but you NEED to create a new account. You don't have to play on it, but this new account is the point of reference they will use to get you your old account back. I created a new account and while it did take 2-3 weeks to get the old one back, and sucked going through their process, at least I got my account back.

(Also, it was kind of fun testing my skill level on a new account and seeing if I could get a better k/d and winrate.)"
This happened to me last night and lost gameplay from day 1. I'm really disappointed but we all know...... they don't care!!!
"I know this doesn�t help you, but maybe it will help someone else.

This is why you don�t reuse passwords, use a password generator so everything is unique, so a breach on one site doesn�t cause you grief on another.

Activision accounts are easy targets, they don�t even tell you when a new IP logs in, make sure you change your password for your other accounts that share your email, or you�ll have the same problem there, too."
Yeah same here. Lost fucking Damascus and half of my weapons that were done on CW.
If this keeps happening i hope when they release a new game it gets BFV treatment when BF6 releases. One of the reason MW succeeded was there was no competition due BFV being shit.
This happened to my buddy and they told him to create an account to file for his old account back and got it back within an hour
"Once you�ve paid your money and definitely after the first year they don�t give a fuck, the game has a number of bugs that they aren�t fixing, Activision has a lot to do with their inaction ."
How did they manage to get past your 2FA? That is a cause for concern I think.
Didn't use 2FA
"My account got hacked last year and support dismissed me twice because my personal info didn't match, even after showing them the receipt of buying the game etc.

Nothing you can do, however if you can still log into your Activision account (via PSN, Xbox, Email etc) you can still get your progress back"
Serious question. Why do people hack accounts like CoD? What do they do with them?
Mine was hacked but the idiot didn�t unlink my Xbox account from it and I was able to get in and reset everything.  The fuck face actually emailed me asking me to unlink his PSN account.  He showed me the website he bought the account from.  He was a cheater who got banned and didn�t want to start a new account and level and unlock shit so he bought a fully leveled account.
This is especially shitty since the xp is fucked so you can�t even regrind camos if you did make a new account and no one would want to respend all that money nor should they have to
"I had my account hacked a couple of months ago. Shit is frustrating as hell. I called the support line and submitted a claim. They said to give them a week to look into it and they would email me if their ""security"" department found anything. I waited a week and never got an email so I called them again. They gave me the same wait a week bullshit as last time. So I did. 2 weeks go by and nothing. So I decided to go to their Twitter and say how horrible of a company they are and that they don't give a shit about any of the players that spend their hard earned money on their content. The next day I got an email with a password reset for my hacked account."
I quit Call of Duty a long time ago because black ops cold war matchmaking was just annoying to deal with. But Jesus Christ Modern Warfare is just a klusterfuck of problems that could be fixed and both Activision and the Developers don't do anything about it. I just quit Call of Duty all together in that point because how bad it is nowdays.
"You file a ticket, create a new account, attempt to reach customer support every day for the next two weeks unsuccessfully, keep doing it for somewhere between 2-6 weeks... then eventually someone will email you and tell you to set up 2 factor authentication.... then about her 8-63 days pass and you get it back."
"When I used Origin my account was hacked into and EA restricted my account to offline play only. I was pissed so I made a new account only to have the same thing happen to that one less than a year later. Shit sucks dude, I�m sorry"
Post it on twitter  #modernwarfare\_brokenupdate
Raven doesn�t say anything and nothing new in the store...
"They stopped caring about MW yall probably wont get another update until season 2, their focus is on cold war and warzone"
im not getting xp from warzone either
I'm getting weapon xp from co op
i have the xbox series x and bought the game 60 bucks. been playing since yesterday and im starting to realize im not getting any XP THE THE HECK
Have you tried beating your meat??
"No, I beat my wife"
"Only thing that awards weapon xp right now is plunder. Do contracts and open boxes, it goes by pretty fast with a buddy helping you."
"Thanks, I�ll def take that route from now on then"
0*2= 0
wait this is dope
"Good for you! I really rarely get these, although i\`m decent with the marksmans."
k
Job security.
"There's been more and more ""bugs"" and little discrepancies ever since cold war launched, from what I've seen. I'm no conspiracy nut, but I honestly think Activision is intentionally having raven fuck MW up so people would go play cold war"
"It could be that one or more of the devs are just plain incompetent.

And I don't see how fucking up MW would encourage people to play CW. They're tied together with Warzone. It seems safe to say that if one's buggy then they're all buggy."
I've had this game since launch and I can assure you that the devs just don't test anything when it comes to patches.
I'm worried when they release a patch for this bug something else will get broken
They hired Funcom to maintain the game.
Wow I feel like it's 2007 again with this video quality
"People are frustrated, the game is letting its fan base down in a huge way and ignoring the community. What do you expect peoples reaction to be?"
D2 actually got significantly better when activision split lol

"I'm not in HS, was in college, got a good-paying job instead. And I don't think Activision is intentionally sabotaging the game, I think it's greedy negligence. They care more about profit on their next game than fixing the one people have already bought. Activision's greed has become a problem. Also, the reason Destiny 2 is worse now is that Bungie doesn't have the budget it did with Activision, I never liked it to begin with, but at least it's free; MW's in an objectively worse state RN than Destiny 2 and it's 60 bucks! Don't pretend that Activision is some altruistic company or that they're good for the gaming community or even that they're tryna make decisions that are good for anyone but themselves. You can say that ""they have a company to run,"" and while that's true, other companies that are just as big also have companies to run but have found a much less scummy and greedy way to do it."

"Imagine white knighting an absolute garbage tier company. They should be embarrassed, every update since the inception of the game has introduced a new bug, many of which are repeats.

They're completely unprofessional and inept, and this is coming from someone who has worked in commissioning for multi-billion dollar Oil & Gas projects. What do you do for a living, work at fucking Walmart?

If I continued to fuck up every single week like they have done I'd be canned within a month."

Devs good. Praise devs. Must get every single kidney stone from devs with my mouth.
My ADHD couldn�t handle 80% of what you wrote but I love you too.
"Thank you, and I'm so sorry."
"> In short, Multiplayer had potential, but it was dragged down by poor decisions and problems that never got fixed 
 
Iw's map design and basic gameplay changes combined with activision forcing sbmm is the reason why I can't call this game the best cod game."
"Imo the map ""design"" is the worst offender. Not only are a majority of the maps impressively bad, I have a fairly decently sized list of maps I flat out refuse to play. I think it's genuinely concerning that some of these maps weren't rejected or at the very least improved at all. Very puzzling. Many such cases!"
"Love you too. I still have fun with the game cause I�m just learning how to quickscope. :) I wish they didn�t make a game every year as well, kinda frustrating."
">Luck-based, brings out the worst in me, etc. I'm not gonna touch another BR again and Warzone is why.

Warzone is probably the least luck-based BR out there so if you are having issues because wz is luck based you are definitely better off not playing any other one.

And I'm not trashing you, BRs just aren't for some people. I play warzone more than MW multiplayer these days for all the reasons you point out in your post. I roll with friends that like to try playing warzone tactically and wz is pretty much the only mode in COD you can do that."
"Thank you. Call me a boomer (even though im turning 20 this year), but I never understood the appeal of BRs. And I'm glad you're not trashing me just because I said I don't like Warzone."
"Unfortunately the game has taken away for me and i cant play MP anymore, but still with all this problems i like to play it again, tbh its been one week i cant play the game now and its been like hell for me. I miss it so much that sometimes i think its still there. I wish i could play it again and finish my Obsidian camo grind, but my wallet wont let me...

Love you too bro."
"The only thing i can't stand is saying ""warzone is luck based"".

I don't want to sound hateful because i'm not, I just don't understand how this mode can be described as ""luck based"" and i hope i made my opinion clear enough (because of my shitty english).

No. It isn't. Maybe you can call it campy at times, but if you know how to shoot a gun you just need to pick up the worst first weapon or in some cases the pistol is good enough to get the first kill and a better starter weapon. After that you have to get 10k and you can get your personal Loadout and from there, go at the finish line.

You can also choose where to drop: into a mid map zone full of people or into an empty land without them, so i don't get the complaints

For the rest, yeah i agree and i'm also pissed because i wanted to go for damascus and it has been with no gun XP and no fix for a week now. Now i'm looking for another good FPS multiplayer game (i re-downloaded BF4 lol)"
"Sorry for the late reply, but I never had a good experience in Warzone. Found a decent gun? Enemy that found a better one materializes right next to me. Building looks safe to enter after double checking all entry points? Camper has been there the whole time. Small amount of ground to cover on foot? Sniped from another country by a silenced Grau. I had to *PRAY* that none of this happens when I tried out Warzone. I'm sorry, but does that not sound luck-based to you?"
"I just played one round of rumble. 

I�m going to officially start the term, �Runble�. All i did was run back to the zone most of the time."
"Right? And mostly thanks to snipers and the fact that you spawn so far away. Use the spawn flare, it's a nice band-aid solution"
It reminds me of an old ps3 game called MAG. Man I miss that crazy ass game
[deleted]
That's not entirely true. MW has played like ass since the merger update. It also has Warzone/Cold war plastered all over it.
"what is your question exactly? no one is forcing you to play anything from CW if you don't want to, and nothing from CW is in multiplayer."

"I am most excited for the Sykov. Hopefully it drops in Multiplayer soon. It's simultaneously the Makarov, and the Stechkin APS. Really looking forward to having a Russian sidearm to match my slav loadouts."
The special requisitions feild upgrade will occasionally give you one of the new guns so you can use it in multiplayer if you're lucky enough to get it.
"I think the CX9 will be the meta SMG when it drops, so far in survival it is insane with its  mobility and base reload speed."
True
It unlocks after you got the sniper rifles too
I'm baffled. Bamboozled. Quite possibly speckledorfed!
Yeah you have to get snipers too for marksman rifles so....
Hold up no way... My buddy who has Damascus didn't have that happen and I even told him what happened and he was confused. Also it says in the description for Platinum camo it will unlock when you have gold for the weapons in that class. Which tells me marksman is one set and snipers is another set? Honestly with what you're telling me it wouldn't surprise me bc Activision is dumb lol
"It really doesn't like secondary kills for the play of the game. I got a six headshot killstreak in quick succession with the Deagle running and gunning and some dude with the AN94 mounted to a wall got it for getting a triple where the enemies lined up for him. I was shocked and honestly had a good ""what the hell?"" laugh. This has happened to me a few times and I can only assume because I got it with a secondary that the game didn't approve."
That's sad.  Body thumping breaking potg anyway.
bruh what fov do you play on?
Looks like 120 with dead silence to me. He just got a shit ton of kills for that deady duration
"Too long in-between kills to be Play of the Game, but nicely done XD"
Bien ouej
where do you find players that have no awareness lmao
Same
Sir I think you�re in the wrong sub
"Oh,what sub do I go on?"
"I�ll have you know I paid in CAD, not euros!"

Microtransactivision
I finally caved and bought MW yesterday so that I could level the RAM... nope guess not. Rumble is a complete shit show unless you have a Kar98 and Plunder takes forever...
"First they get rid of Shoothouse / Shipment. Now I have like 0 point in playing since I'm getting literally nothing each game. Shits wack yo, that's crazy they haven't said shit, is it like this on cold war too ?"
"Except they did tweet about it though...

Problem is Raven doesn�t know what the hell theyre doing. This isn�t a matter of pushing a button."
"But they fixed the operator selection really quickly, cut them some slack...

/s"
"If we don�t finish the battle pass and get all the free money to get next season, we have to pay for it again. It�s the way they market it. Just like meta guns every season, that just all seem to be in the battle pass to get them."
No xp gain in infected but there is in warzone
still getting packet loss burst in addition my shots sometimes not registering hitmarkers.
"COD has been a yearly franchise for a long fucking time buddy

This is like people complaining that ea isn�t updating and working on last years fifa or madden

Inb4 downvotes for uncomfortable truths"
"So you're telling me that because they opt out for this business model of releasing a game per year, it means we should not receive updates when the game is completely broken less than two years after it?  


I think what you just said is well, stupid AF"
They did an update which ruined the whole game and now everyone is mad that weapon progression isn�t being fixed while the people making the cod games are probably making another fucking black ops game and not fixing a game which was one of their best ones since black ops 2
"Difference is the developers are different. This is infinity wards latest game. There is no reason why they can't support it, especially because warzone runs off the same engine, uses lots of the same guns and equipment etc."
Bruh I�m snowed in. Arizona just is on some shit that�s all.
Is that right? I've never seen snow lol. It stayed in the 80s this year so we had a pretty warm winter.
Damn! There is snow covering the ground up here in PA and it snows pretty much every night.
Yup there�s snow everywhere up hear in New York lol
Where the hell is the Rainbow Sparkles bundle tho. Hurry tf up Acti. Thanks.
"they didnt, its part of the next battle pass"
There isn�t going to be another MW battle pass.
They literally added it to the game they aren�t going to ban you hell they dont even ban hackers
"I have the Sykov and CX-9 max leveled on Survival

As soon as the RAAL MG is unlockable, I'll level up that too

So far I'm not on the bad list, so you're fine"
Any tips for leveling up the sykov? i struggle to get kills with it and have to melee all the time
"Fortunately for you, apparently the new LMG is unlockable! How you unlock it is beyond me however."
I�ve done the challenge to unlock it but it�s not appearing.. anyone had this issue?
The update bugged weapon progression and challenges too thats why
It is only available in survival mode. (Go to Co-op)
Wait you can actually use the Sykov pistol in MW multiplayer?
"He �unlocked it� not used it, he�s asking if it�s ok to use it in survival since it can be used over there"
"Well that didn't take long, i spammed ""Fix Hitmarkers"" maybe 20 times on twitter and got blocked/flagged by activision support LMFAO"
I salute you soldier.
I�ve been spamming their Instagram(no twitter).
"Im lost, ""Fix hitmarkers"" ?? Is there a problem idk about?"
The only way they will give a shit is when the profits start to drop off significantly but unfortunately too many people give Activision money for that to happen.
"There's only one way to fix this. Go play something else, for a couple of years. If you keep giving them money when they fuck you over, your complaint has no value."
"I agree. That's what I and a lot of other people already have done. MW 2019 is the only COD I've bought since the first Black Ops. I waited until they came out with some shit that was fun  and a better installment of the good days.  
I won't be buying another CoD after this shit show on an otherwise excellent game for probably another decade."
"Bro they didn�t take care of this game when it was the current CoD, they�re not gonna take care of it now. 

Sorry to say, but you would be wasting your time."
"Fr people on this sub acting like this game never had a single issue before cw and are suddenly surprised this game is broken

They didn't give a shit before and don't give a shit now"
Trust this is the only way to get them to give a shit. It isn't a waste of time.
"I just want to play your game like I did before where I could play for hour uninterrupted. I forget what patch it was now becuase I stopped playing for a few months now. But since that one patch the only other thing I have changed is my ram and I constantly get disc read errors.

I remember months back trying to find solutions or any acknowledgement of the issue on your part and found nothing. I've tried all the fixes that have and have not worked for others with the same issue to no avail. 

I just want an answer a proper fix from your end, and not "" Have you tried scan and repair? or have you tried reinstalling? "" YES I have multiple times. And everytime I maybe get a game or 2 in and then insert random disc read error since they always seem to be different. Its bad enough there are dev errors but those I have been able to get under control with fixes from others. 

I just wonder why multiple patches since I played last and I even did a refresh install just last night. How can it be I upgrade my ram from 16 to 32 and it breaks the game lol."
I also play on PC and had a similar issue. Only way I resolved it was a full re-install which fucking sucks given the game is like 270GB now.
"If you really want to wake them up, have everyone stop playing the game in unison. That�ll be a fucking wake up call. But i doubt that�ll ever happen."
"woah there pickle, why do you doubt that will ever happen? i think youre definitely on to something here and it will absolutely happen.

 we just need to get anonymous to hack them, get the email addresses of everyone that bought the game, send out emails telling everyone to stop playing on a certain date, then bobs your hoskins -we fucking done it! 

then they will fix the game and we will celebrate outside the whitehouse with warm milk and egg salad sandwiches.

you should spearhead this campaign. be the voice we need in these dark times. o captain my captain x"
I say we go to google/apple store and give cod mobile 1 stars as well. Do anything we can to hurt them untill it's fixed.
looooool this guy.
"That'd be kinda petty, but hey, whatever it takes (unless it's illegal or harassing individual devs or employees, but that's a given)."
Or stop supporting them. There are so many better options than cod.
Like what?
"Yeah, and at the same time might as well also tell them to put Shipment and Shoot House 24/7 back and make them stay there permanently (and separately too)"
"These guys know that rn Warzone doesn't really have a competitor. They aren't afraid players will leave because they got no where else to go. I'm just disappointed that in their fuck up that is cold war, its bleeding into Warzone. Like why did they have to ruin a game i paid money for and enjoyed."
"I was with you until you said to comment on Treyarch's social media sites.  I'm pretty sure having content about a game that isn't related to their game wouldn't be helpful at all.  It would be equivalent to them putting BOCW content in MW that we had to look at all the ti.....hey, wait a minute"
"That was my logic. They're working together closely enough to at least say ""hey, you guys are fucking up over there"""
"Man, people weren't kidding when they said the CoD community was full of children, including the adults."
"5 years ago I would have agreed with you. MW 2019 in my experience is full of toxic adults but I rarely into children or people acting like kids.   
This is 2021. People respond to bad PR more than trouble tickets and support forums. I wish it wasn't the case. But clearly they have no intention of fixing this & the goal here is to motivate them to do so. If they see a lot of people are experiencing these bugs and complaining about it, they're more likely to take some action on it."
Slagging them off won�t do anything lmao
"well clearly it will because a guy on this thread just said they blocked his twitter account after he spammed them 20 times. thats something that wouldnt have happened if he did nothing. 

man id love to see the look on their faces when they got those 20 tweets, they mustve been like ""ohhhh shiiiiiiit, battle stations. we gotta block this cyber attack before they ruin us."" fuck yeh

yo does anyone know where i can get a guy fawkes mask from?  i got my mum to make one out of paper mache but my dad sat on it."
Ive just been trolling that fucking joke of a community manager ashley. Seems to be a recurring issue with activision.
Egg their house
"I don't have twitter, telegram, instagram or facebook. Where can I buy cheap SIM cards and proxies to sign up for them?"
I'm just beginning to use Kovaak... What setup do you use to do so good in Warzone.... New to this.
Just did some research and the burger town code was a one week event with grubhub and burgerking back in early november of 2019 in only 12 cities in the US. The juggernaut calling card and emblem was a 5 gum promo in spain that lasted a month or two in late 2019.
Where did you get the codes from originally?
Yes if you complete all the weapon challenges that is probably the rarest one
"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Campaign is busted too (since November).

Not ""busted"" as in ""you can't play it at all"", but there's a bug that means loading times seem to arbitrarily get really, really long when booting a save or after death. I was waiting 2-3 minutes every time I died the last time I played it.

Honestly, imagine being someone who just bought this game..."
Bizarre. It was near instant when I played on my SSD. It was pretty impressive honestly.
OMG I thought that it's because of my hdd
I bought the game yesterday :(
i played thru the entire campaign and it didn't unlock shit
Cool?
Oh that was nasty!
Thank you good sir! EBR kinda hits sometimes !
"DAAAAAAAAAAAMN! Yeah, that was insane. Hats off to you!"
Thank you sir ...i appreciate your comment
It�s because there isn�t a ninja perk and footstep are so fucking loud. It really fucked the speed of the game. Best maps to play on are shoot house and shipment.
"Yeah so I've heard, sadly those are the only ones."
"I can feel what you mean but basically MW2019 has a better game engine, ppl just feel better in the game because everything flows better and attatchments ""make more sense"" which i can see. The people play differently due to this though, so i can see how its unlikable. But ever since COD existed ive gotten really good at ending campers, so i dont really even notice, but thats just me. Cold War reminds me of the BO2 days which is what ive always wanted, so its really a toss up for me. I still feel yah"
"Loved BO2, one of the best cods if not the best."
Cold War plays like an actual CoD game while MW was trying to be Rainbow6 siege on battlefield size maps. The animations and gameplay is great actually however the way the game is designed doesn't promote moving unfortunately.
I couldn't agree more! That's what I think too!
HELL no this game is wayyy better than Cold War
"They both have their ups and downs, but so far, even though Cold War has less content atm, it has more positives than MW imo.

Only thing is enjoying about MW would be the faster ttk and feel of the guns... yeah actually that's about it."
"Yeah I think a lot of people just love the game for the engine. Don�t get me wrong, it�s an incredible engine and the game feels smooth and the guns feel excellent, but I don�t like the core gameplay loop. It�s just designed to be so slow paced and tactical and because of that I�d rather play almost any other cod (within reason lol, I�m lookin at you BO4, WW2, AW, Ghosts, IW). However that doesn�t change the fact that I put a shit ton of time into this game during its lifecycle either way, even though I don�t think it was the best."
MW was the first cod I bought since mw3. I think it's just a lot different than other cod games. I wish I refunded cold war because that shit is busted on pc. It was also the first cod in however long to just be a regular modern call of duty. Overall I think it's a solid 6.5/10 game
Busted in PC how?
I agree. I only play it because I'm broke. Overrated average game. Not the cod I was expecting. Its all because of warzone. I rarely play that crap. I just noob it up on cod now. No point in trying to play with skill.
"This game won back a lot of people that had basically lost interest since the days of the original Modern Warfare trilogy (myself included). The modern theme appeals to a lot of people, but without the nonsense like soldiers wearing mech suits and all the other stuff that came in previous titles.

The Campaign was well done; the Multiplayer isn't anything special, but at the same time it just delivers the usual, fluid FPS gameplay that we all know and love in a more modern engine.

That said, with everything that's been happening lately, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of players go back to Battlefield for their AAA FPS fix in the future. Activision / IW aren't exactly inspiring a lot of hope with their behaviour lately."
I think Treyarch does things better even though their engine is a little outdated I guess.
[deleted]
"Yeah, it does well as a game that isn't under the CoD title."
"Is this a troll ?  
Anyway about camping I don't see that much (read my post about EU/Asia/USA mindsets)  
Attachements in BOCW are senseless and OP. Whereas in MW all attachments have drawbacks so a full stock weapons is very competitive.

I'm willing to make a full BOCW vs MW rundown, with things nobody ever mentionned. If you're patient it'll arrive"
"I'll be waiting for it, Cold War definitely has drawbacks to the better attachments. Link me it when uploaded."
"The people who claim Cold War looks worse than MW are blind fanboys. And that�s coming from someone who�s enjoyed MW2019 since launch. 

All you need to do is compare the Handler and Heist skins for park across both games. In CW she looks realistic, in MW she looks like the love child between Michael Jackson and Cynthia from Rugrats."
"Also idk what's up with woods' hair in MW, sometimes he looks like he got his hair shaved."
I'd your playing on xbox when u record clips check the video quality if it's low it' take less time for the video to load if it's high like 1080p it just takes more time
[deleted]
My video settings is 1080p it might just be my brightness
Rewarding good players isn't in Activisions vocabulary. See: SBMM
Exactly. They don't want you to do well thus no incentive to do so.

"I liked mw2�s style too. I liked the gold emblems you unlocked for getting precision kills with weapons. I think it was like 2000 headshot kills, but I can�t remember."
If only there was a feature allowing you to lower your head and find cover during a reload.
Kinda like crouching.
"Hes already doing it wrong, trying to do wall peeking with an SKS on core, lol.  Dont expect too much."
This is the way
You need to level up to unlock them :) there is like 40 weapons + DLC weapons
I think at this point most of the weapons are unlockable through gameolay as well (maybe not the melee weapons). There are alot of variants of the weapons you can pay for as well but as far as I can tell they are just a pre-setup gun with a cool Camo on it.
"You just level up. You should get a new gun every level or so at first. Also, the DLC guns are all unlockable through challenges. Just look at the gun in the menu and it will tell you what challenge you need to do to unlock it. You don't have to pay for any guns in this game."
"In multiplayer you have to level up yourself to unlock weapons in general and the weapons to unlock attachments.  Due to a bug from the last update you may not currently get experience in multiplayer but it is possible in co-op.
There are also missions which will unlock blueprints which are wrap with cosmetic changes and attachments already included which greatly alter the handling.

Hope that helps."
"and also you need to complete the tasks to unlock them, previously u got them through battle pass"
"Go on create a class, armory is for blueprints youve unlocked/bought"
By unlocking new guns in multiplayer
Level up to gain the main suite of weapons. The other weapons have a challenge associated with them
You need to level up. But right now modern warfare XP is broken so you can�t really level up
"I just figured out that you can see your weapons in the loadout screen, which you need to reach level 4 to unlock. The armory is kinda irrelevant for new players."
You can also get guns from chests and use them until you have leveled up your own guns.
Only on Warzone though
"Time limit should be longer, and probably slightly quicker to pick up the suit, I agree. But I think the mode is pretty fun tbh"
"Yeah onslaught is basically what team dwfendr should have been 

Map wise the only stinker is tank factory. It's so so open it literally ends every round in a draw."
My squad had a tonne of fun with onslaughter and reinforce last night.  Honestly I'd prefer to lay those modes regularly than WZ quads.......
Onslaughter fucking sucks tbh
true
Unless you somehow are able to give us weapon xp that�s a no from me (Simon cowell voice)

Your post is gone
"Yeah, I think we should, just to scare Activision enough to start listening. At the moment, Activision doesn't take the community that made CoD what it is seriously, we need to do something to get Activision to start taking us seriously again."
"Just checked, no update for me. But yeah, it�s annoying to play and not progress."
"Huh, it's weird how they do updates. I've heard varied results on this update, so maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones."
"I dont understand why I have been seeing people say they cant play. I have been playing just fine. Multiplayer, warzone and private matches"
You're prolly just not getting the bugs everyone else is. The bugs seem to be on a case by case basis.
"yeah, who cares about warzone?"
" A lot of people, but still, it shouldn't take so much precedence over the MP, since you need to buy the MP."
I'd keep your celebrations until we're sure. This isn't the first such post I've seen in the last week.
Denizen with the truth!
"Yeah, none of the issues I started experiencing last week have been fixed. I still crash every four games if I don't quit back to the main menu (all things, considered, not that bad since I can deal with it). Servers still laggy, no hit markers, no XP of any kind. It's not fixed."
still broken for me as of 30 minutes ago. played for a couple hours and got zero weapon xp. hopefully it'll be fixed for me soon
Same here. I've been trying to do Grinch's challenge forever now.
"You�re new here, aren�t you?"
it just got fixed
"It�s still not working for many, myself included"
bruh
This entire subreddit has covered this
Same thing happening to me.
"We don't have any issue getting signed in and joining a lobby.  But once the map begins loading, the screen freezes for a second and then quickly flashes a red, or green, bar across the bottom half of the screen and then kicks us back to the Xbox home screen.

Sometimes we can get in a game or two before getting kicked, but usually it's so frequently that it's not even worth trying.  It would be really nice if they would at least acknowledge the issue and tell us if a fix is even in the works."
Same this is annoying
"Same bro, help plz"
Same here. Ever since coldwar integration! They need to fix this. At least before there was a work around to get splitscreen to work now it's down right unplayable. I vote coldwar should just mix with rhere black ops 4 and do there br in blackout . And leave modernwarfare/warzone alone
"I was hoping today's update would resolve the split-screen crashing issue, but apparently not.  I'm guessing the overall number of split-screen players is a small enough percentage of users that they simply don't view it as worthwhile endeavor..."
"Unfortunately, that seems to be the case. Split screen problems in modern warfare doesnt seem to be in their list of priorities"
Is there a solution/fix for this? It's happening to us aswell
"Apparently not. Maybe there's just not enough people complaining about it for them to spend any real energy trying to resolve it. People keep playing the game anyways and there's no real competition. So, they can afford to leave that as it is"
I ran with the Kar for a good while. I always use the NVG scope on it. Damn good gun
"Never tried that scope, might have to give it a try! But definitely one of the most versatile snipers I�ve ever used"
"Holy shit! Those are some god-like shots, Nice one dude!"
Thanks bro!! Doesn�t happen too often but when it does ;)
A fellow Cronen + T-pose user. This is the way
A man of taste
damn that was clean
"Thanks man, minor heart attacks is all it took"
Meanwhile I get fucking hit markers from 10 feet away lol
Whats bunker 11? Sorry I'm a turd
Its a bunker in verdansk which you can open by finding the 3 digit code and then activating the code by using 3 phones which then opens it for easter egg.
Sorry which was the weapon you get from the bunker?
MP7. Blueprint looks really good with gold
"I was having this issue and managed to solve it. 
May not work for you, but if you have Nvidia GeForce Experience, Open it up and go to games & make sure MW is unchecked for Optimisation and then remove it from the list. That solved the issue for me! Good luck"
Thanks! Imma take a look thanks for the help!
I got a response from fx_reed on Twitter and he @�d one of the associate guys at Infinity Ward so hopefully this just gets resolved in general soon
From what I understand the camo unlocks still work in MP. But if you can unlock enough attachments it could still be difficult...
"if you are actually serious about gun leveling you have to do Plunder and complete contracts. It's straight up as fast (often faster) than multiplayer. Leveling guns in WZ is real close to the zero XP bug, since at best you get like 5 kills per 30 min? very few people will average more and the vast majority will only have 2-3 if any."
I just edited my post and meant to put warzone rumble
"actually i find out that going in Solo and doing supply run is actually better for several reason :

\- people tend do camp more and not shoot at random vehicles passing by                          
\- you don't actually need to exit the vehicle to finish the contract, so get a trophy with thebig one and you are super safe                                                                                                 
\- this is the main one, you get 20% more exp bonus each contract you do.

Without boring you with math, here's a quick example : 10 supply run in Plunder vs BR.every supply run is 500x2 weapon exp considering double exp token.Well in Plunder it's 10k, in BR i'ts 19k. and 10 is a below-avarage number, even in BR, if you play for contract only. if we go up to 15, the difference become way bigger, being 15k vs 36k, more then double exp.

Beside that, going for this playstyle in BR gave me a lot of top 10 placement, and a couple of wins, (low kills win, but still win).                                                                       Another upside is that in BR, after the supply runs out, you can get one last bounty contract, and if you manage to kill the target  after 10+ contract, you will get an insane amount of exp, i did like from 41, to 44 only with that final boosted bounty kill on the FFAR.

It actually has one major downside, that of course is the fact that you do not spawn with your loadout. That's why it is better for lvl up ground weapons so you don't have to waste the time getting money for loadout, but even for other weapons it could be done starting off with a scavenger into loadout, it may be delayed a bit, but it's still doable and worth."
It should be lesson for them to keep supporting past games no matter the newer games.
I played Cold War Beta and the first thing I said when I loaded into a game was �oh my fucking god they made a step back� Then I got Modern warfare
The skill based match making made it way to sweaty for me and I miss ground war :(
How did you get the Beta and can that be done for a console?  I�d be interested in one for the next title as I am definitely not a fan of Cold War.
They haven't done anything yet so I doubt they'll do anything now
Why I said hopefully but yeah seems like a far shot
"Straight up, cod 2021 needs to be mw2 made by same people who did mw2019. Sledgehammer is fucking horrible so hard pass if they're making cod2021. I hate bf since 2 but 6 is going to fuck cod so hard in the ass if it isn't."
Here's proof I have the og btw just so poeple don't accuse me of just wanting to get it since I missed it.   [https://ibb.co/yypXDjy](https://ibb.co/yypXDjy)
"Well, I would reduce the requirements to 75 or 60 kills, but I like that idea"
I would kill for that gun. Got the game at the start of December 2019 but I was too busy with uni to play enough  to hit 155 :(
"Weird, as long as the first camo of the category is unlocked, I have no issues progressing. Just can�t unlock the next set without leveling up."
"Camos are fine, I unlock a bunch every match. It's the actual weapon unlocks that have been giving me trouble. I unlocked the SPR with the Kar98 in Plunder this week as well, so I think the issue is Modern Warfare exclusive."
"Ive been having the same thing with a Grinch operator mission, im required to kill 5 people whist aimed down sights, but it never seems to progress haha"
I was just able to unlock the CR Max yesterday
Holy shit did they fucking rename or delete the function that tracks challenge progression across the board or smth? There's not much that's small that can bung up everything on this scale.
"Just yesterday I unlocked the an94 with no problem, seems weird"
"i tried this, once you unlink a account you cant relink for 12months. Currently im on month like 4 I have 2 accounts both level 1. I was tryna move my 155 from my smurf to my main but got stumped here. Waiting out my 12 month thing so i can get my acc back with everything i paid for its all gone until the 1 month period is over:( Now i have 2 PSN account with Neither a activision linked bc i cant relink or link with a new one"
"I'm sorry, that's really unfortunate. I could just login in-game through the new account though no? I can't log in now though else I get an error so I need to unlink the old account first but I'd like confirmation first is all."
"That�s really lame. I was gonna do this once I could unlink my account. You�re telling me after I wait however much longer I have, and I unlink my account, I can�t link it with a new account for 12 months? And it just sits there dormant?"
"No, i did this recently and nothing transferred except my cod points and the starter pack I bought. Worst mistake of my life"
"I'm sorry your shit got lost. If you go on the Activision site and go under support, there's a tab for account recovery that might help you there. Live support might also be able to help you out. It's weird though cause everything transferred for me except my cod points but I was told that it wouldn't. I hope you get your stuff back dude."
"It was a great mode in Ghosts, was my fav.

It really didn't work in IW, haven't played it on MW before.

I'm hoping it'll play well."
It's pretty awesome
"Played one game, seems quite good really. But I wish it was available in hardcore."
"I wish hardcore was the base game, and core was the mode we had to switch to"
"Have 1 guy hang back and all 3 of your team push. If they die you bring them back 

Having said that the risk is they you then might get trapped, but there's only 4 enemies so the risk isn't that big. 

Man I love reinforce.

Randoms are pretty bad though. Always get that one guy who just hides and doesn't cap flags. Had a game where noob was in a 1v1 next to B flag and he just camped it. Even when the other guy started capping a different flag he still didn't cap B. Very frustrating to watch haha"
Reinforce has been out for a while. The just make it an LTM.
All of those issues sound like bugs introduced in the latest patch. Your connection should be fine :)
"Its would seem these are all bugs that have been introduced alongside the latest patch. Majority of the people have been complaining about it on this sub and rightfully so. Its definitely not your network, we just gotta wait for IW to fix it when the start giving a shit again...who knows when that'll be haha"
"Oh thank god, it�s typical day one being set up these issues come up, you think it�s the ISP. Thanks for letting me know"
"I normally have no problem with virgin, the latest patch has messed it up for me, the lag is really bad tonight. I did have NAT open, but when black ops came out for some reason it went to moderate, I haven't bothered trying to change it back."
"I�m glad it�s not just me then, have you noticed anything odd about hit markers tonight?"

I WASTED A ONE HOUR DOUBLE WEAPON XP TOKEN THE OTHER DAY TRYING TO LEVEL UP MY AMEX GOD DAMNIT.
I was trying to rank up my fennec for like 4 hours thought I would be max level because I used all my dwxp and when I checked it I literally had to progression. I almost threw my game out the window
Still can�t get support over my account being reset sadly
"somehow weapon progression works for me again. It didn't for a while, but I tried 12h ago and I somehow got xp again for my AK. Don't know if it was the normal amount though"
Also put an anti cheat please your game will not be successful if it is call of duty hackzone. Its not just me but everyone wants this so please put one in
"Promote this hashtag on ALL Raven's and Activision social media sites, make noise they'll pay attention too.   I've got to wonder why all the ""Gamer""  ezines are ignoring how they broke MW 2019 so badly.    Tweets, Fb's and Insta's count more to them than our support tickets.

I cant hit my shots so I dont have this problem
I felt this in my fucking soul.

r/suicidebywords
Yeah me too
"Is that still not resolved? The last I had was no hit markers, then the update took away the red one on kill, I haven�t played since. Think I�ll wait till it�s sorted"
"I recorded it yesterday morning, so no, but I have not played since."
If I get hit markers they�re replaced with 4 of the pulsating load circles. My reticle for my sight and hip fire it also being replaced with these load circles so maybe it�s a new feature
"they can't be serious about not fixing this for a week now. I'm seriously addicted to fucking cod for years and i fell in love with mw gunplay but this will be definitely the last one. Fuck Cold war, fuck activision, fuck carol baskin"
There's something odd with the crosshairs too.
It like takes a second to load in
The game is just all kinds of fucked right now
Developers fucked it for cw to get sales
"tbh idgaf about the hitmarkers, I sometimes play without them. I'm just really bummed about the xp and the random weapon skins changing every 3 minutes. Its throwing me off too much."
Do you mean your xp is glitched or something? I feel like it�s taking me forever to level up guns and I�m only getting 100 xp per game regardless of kills
"Same. Thought I was going crazy, glad it�s not only me. It�s intermittent for me. Some matches I�ll make the correct amount others my gun won�t level up at all. Pretty upset tbh don�t know why they expect me to �upgrade� to Cold War if it�s probably just going to hit the same issues."
Ok glad im not the only one!
"I had this in warzone and was losing my mind, checking my damage constantly"
"Lemme guess, they still have HM in Cold War?"
Yes
"This is why I play Hardcore after I got Damascus on the DLC guns I like, at least in hardcore there�s only a *few* guns that give out hitmarkers....."

Holy shit I thought I was the only one. I was blaming it on lag because the other thing I am seeing a lot is people teleporting along instead of moving smoothly.
"They took your hitmarker, but they took my whole ass damascus acc :("
There�s no weapon XP atm it�s bugged
"There has been no Weapon XP for a week since last Thursday's patch. Yesterday's patch did nothing to address this issue. All we have is they are ""looking into it"". Apparently they need some glasses."
im curious what that bullshit patch did anyway considering theres no patch notes
"Ah, it�s �bugged.� Lovely."
"the 11gb update they gave us last week came with a weapon xp bug, meaning guns aren't receiving any xp. We don't know when this will be fixed. I believe ravensoft is aware of this situation? But don't quote me on that"
"If you need XP, do plunder supply runs, since kills give no xp at the moment."
As in warzone?
Xp is broken right now
That�s happening to me with the FAL. I think it�s bugged
Don't spend on dime until they fix the cheating problem.
well I'm glad I only got the battle pass once and got a bunch of leftover CP
You don�t have to spend a dime let other people use their own money
What weapons do the Spetsnaz pack have? Or do they have any?
they have none which is really annoying. it's one of those bundles with no weapons
I Want the demon dogs outfit
Spetsnaz is out!!
is it in the just for you in your shop
this glitch has been going on for a week now. We don't know when the glitch will be patched lol
"Yes, for some reason you don't earn WXP in MW2019 multi-player. That's Infinity Ward for you."
I wonder when they will fix this I�m slowly giving up on cod :/
You can gain experience in co-op special ops.  Not sure if it has returned to multiplayer with the update today though.
I don't think it has
Also playing plunder gives wxp
You�re definitely not the only one...
I am honestly going back to battlefield because of this bug.
"Hell no! Stay away. I lost $60 on this last week. The game has been broken since Thursday last week and my dumb ass purchased it on Friday just assuming it would work. You'll be stuck with all base-level weapons and no unlocks. If you do end up buying. Don't make my misake and wait 72 hours before asking for a refund. 

The only communication we've had from ATVI is ""looking into it"". And when I talked to support they said no ETA. Some have even reported that chat support has told them it might not ever get fixed."
"Damn, yeah I'm really feeling like I shouldn't get it, and like I said I have cold war anyway"
"i personally love it much more than cold war, but i�ve also always favored the modern warfare games to black ops"
"The current bugs will go away soon enough. the multiplayer is still quite active but the battle pass doesn't work there, you won't be able to unlock any operators without buying them, the playlist is a nightmare, and both regular and weapon xp gain is much slower than CW (that's when they work at all, which is currently not the case).

You can get most of the experience just thru plunder / rebirth / special modes like rumble, and save $45."
"Can't get operators without buying them?? Since when? Most of the operators are unlocked through gameplay either through the campaign, spec ops, or multiplayer challenges."
That's what I've been doing and it's worked so far
I think it's a great game when it's working.... It's currently not working.
"I love this game, but **don't buy this game**.  

They already have my money, they don't deserve any more with the way they've been treating the game and the playerbase.  The neglect in balance, updates, and **bugs** that have been plaguing the game for so long, it's just not worth jumping into it and coming to the same discovery many of us that got lured in with the initial product and hope."
"I'm seeing this is a very divided issue here, but I definitely understand how the rose tinted glasses have worn off from mw. I still overall love the idea of getting the game at a better price and a game I enjoy overall but I guess I'll give it some thought. I do agree they are treating the community like dogshit and by basically just doing a playlist update instead of putting it off till they fixed the bug that's essentially killing their game, it's pretty stupid."
"I'd say yes. There's some weird bugs that just came out in the last update which suck but they'll be fixed soon enough. You can always play the campaign in the meantime, it's fantastic. I've put over 20 days into multiplayer and I'm not sick of it yet. There's a ton of guns and maps that will keep you satisfied for a long time. I exclusively play Search and Destroy, TDM won't be nearly as enjoyable in my experience."
"I bought it a few weeks ago and has really been enjoying it. The campaign is in my opinion a truly great single player experience with some of the most action packed, breathtaking scenery and heartbreaking moments I had in a game for a long time. 

Co-op is also also a great experience. There are a total of about 8 different missions excluding survival and classic special operations which feature even more missions that I haven�t done yet. 

The multiplayer is really good when it works (last week has been pretty rough, but the week before it was a blast) and when matchmaking works you get some pretty good fights. I personally really like almost all the maps. A lot of the maps kind of force you to play a bit slower and check all angles before rushing in, which I personally really like. This is kind of controversial as cod usually features extremely simple map designs (three lane setups) without many dark corners or rooms to camp in. If you like the more tactical approach, flash bang a room before moving in, slowly checking all angles and generally moving around the map a bit slower I think you will enjoy multiplayer. 

All in all I would recommend the game to everyone, even though it is kind of broken as of writing this. The movement, animations, setting, gunplay and design are all really superb, but if I were you I would maybe wait until we get an update that fixes the no xp bug in multiplayer, or just play single player and co op until they patch it."
"COD BOCW has Zombies and a more interactive Campaign in my opinion, but MW has better Multiplayer and it's Campaign is more realistic. Co-op is barely used but you can test out the guns that are coming in Survival there."
Use this to help get better pros and cons to make a choice :D
When is the next time modern warfare will be on sale?
I don't know but I don't expect it to be soon
Cold war is on sale
"I bought it this week since i have stuff unlocked from warzone and i can level up the cold war battlepass otherwise i would never buy it. 

Most Maps are awful unless it is an objective game mode. Movement exploits are tilted to rushers so it can play like CW sometimes.


TDM is unplayable for me, otherwise it can be fun."
"Yeah I can see that, I'm very much intrigued by the aspects of mw vs cold war and it truly looks like warzone is gonna keep getting support for this year and maybe even going forward so it makes sense to buy in my head and on pc on sale it's great imo"
If you've already got Cold War then I'd say no because at least people move and run about in Black Ops where in Modern Warfare everyones just a camping pussy unless if you play on two maps lol
No
"just curious, why"
"Better than CW, this is at least working game"
"that is true, and like i said ive enjoyed it in the past when the free weekends were going on"
If there is no patch by tonight we all definitely need to spam
"I will make a Twitter just to spam them. I�m his is insane, I�m all my years of gaming I�ve never seen a bug this bad with literally no acknowledgment from the company for so long"
"Trust me, if the entire community spams them, they will make a new patch in 34 seconds."
I ain�t giving up on the game. Best thing that�s rolled out in a while but I am willing to spam tweet those losers
"i really don�t want to either, that�s why i still have hope somethings coming tonight. im halfway done with demascus and it�s been super fun."
At what time do the patches usually drop? Or how many hours from now anyway.
"I live on west coast, california, so for me it�s around 10PM PST. that would about 10 hours from now(me writing this comment). but this is just based on previous updates, there�s no guarantee it�ll be the same today."
"Hey man! I've had the same issue for a while. If you want to take a little time to read this, maybe we can start a thread here of possible solutions because I'm in the same boat as you. From December of 2019 until about June of 2020, I played COD: MW/Warzone flawlessly. Afterwords, I uninstalled to reinstall windows for an unrelated reason, and installed MW a month later. Hasn't worked since as of today, February 12th, 2021.

What I tried was the following:

* Scan and repair
* Added command line for MW in [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) software as -d3d11 for starting in DX11
* Ran CMD as admin, sfc /scannow
* DISM check and image repair
* Switched ram sticks
* Updated drivers, both studio and game, to the latest drivers (currently on 461.40)
* Used DDU to uninstall drivers and tried 10 game drivers and 10 studio... These were all the GPU updates listed that were available from the geforce drivers tab
* Tried installing on on HDD and my SSD, no joy
* Updated Intel VGA drivers
* The game flashes and glitches between a black screen in safe mode kind of view on my main monitor connected to my RTX 2060 Super and moves into my second Intel screen and glitches that too until I Alt + F4 the window to close it; I decided to unplug the other monitor and disconnect the monitor in my MSI bios settings
* Installed a windows 10 virtual machine in VMWare and used the most up to date driver for NVidia, same crash, just in a windows VM
* No GPU overlcock ever
* Went from 4.9 GHz back to basic clock at 3.65 GHz on i7-9700k

The game has a pretty wicked crash that causes a black, flashing, glitching screen on both my monitors. Whether overclocked or not, game doesn't work. Nothing seems to work. I'm completely bummed and Activision support has been anything except helpful. Blizzard couldn't help.

Specs: i7-9700k, Corsair ram 3200 Mhz 32 Gb, RTX 2060 Super, MSI Z390 Gaming MPG motherboard, Castle 240EX AIO cooler, 1TB HDD, 1TB SSD.

Edit: I have tons of games that work... MSFS2020, Lockheed Martin Prepar3d V5.1 with thousands of dollars in addons, Destroy all Humans, Fishing Planet/The Fisherman, Halo, Squad, Battlefield, Darksouls 1-3, Bloodbourne, Bioshock (all games), and Payday 2, etc etc etc etc. None have failed except COD: MW on PC."
Yeah man..still crashing at mine
"Out of interest have you tried in Windows 10? You could try an older driver, not sure how newer drivers would play with an out of date operating system, despite I'm assuming nvidias best efforts..."
"I only have WIN7... Do you think it would relate to that ?

I play like 7 other games where I do not have this issue.."
"I still don�t like Cold War, feels like a complete downgrade."
"It is, it's a cartoon shooter with heavy amounts of SBMM."
Zombies is a banger. Everything else is shite.
"Imo it feels just like black ops 1/2 so I really like it

Mw feels better as a shooter, but I have a soft spot for the black ops style maps/gunplay & weapons so I pretty much only play warzone over mw multiplayer but that�s just me"
Only because it is
"Graphics are a downgrade but it�s a much more enjoyable game for me. Faster paced, better weapon balancing, slide canceling is punished, ninja added back, etc"
"""This might be an unpopular opinion"" followed by the most common opinion on reddit"
I said that cuz u never know how many cold war simps there are in this subreddit. Don�t want to risk it.
"better =/= more popular. With that said, I did enjoy my time in MW2019 back when they had free week/weekends for it. I'm not here to debate which is better or which is more popular. All I want to say it's ridiculous that as a cold war player I am forced to play Warzone to complete certain missions and that some of them are just nearly impossible to do because they entirely depend on coordination with teammates and I always end up in shitty squads. On top of that I can't grind for MW2019 camos in WZ but yet I can grind for Dark Matter in WZ (not that I'm going to do that when I have CW)"
">	This might be an unpopular opinion 

Lol"
">this might be an unpopular opinion

>opinion that is posted on here 5x a day"
"At this point i'm hoping someone makes a mw clone, i'll switch to that if it was like mw. I don't want bf6 before anyone says to wait for that. Bf is the exact opposite of what I like=giant maps like warzone full of vehicles and getting sniped."
There is this free game called Iron Sight obviously not to MW standards so don�t expect a MW clone but for a free game it�s fun and something new
When will this sub shut up already lmfao
I need to stop going on this subreddit and r/blackopscoldwar they're both filled with pretentious oldheads who don't even know what they're talking about.
Probably never unless MW is made the main center of attention
Finally... guess there are a couple of us on the same page. These dummies think activision and Infinityward aren�t a business trying to make money.
"I�m die hard MW but damn, stfu. We get it, cw bad. I don�t think you need to broadcast that to a sub dedicated to mw."
We will shut up once they leave the game alone in peace.
yeah this post made me finally unsubscribe from the MW sub. this is the 1000th time i�ve read this exact post
"There might be more people on MW than CW, and that's not including Warzone.  Read somewhere a lot of people who play WZ for free end up buying MW."
"I mean, I never remembered leveling up very fast in modern warfare. Plus the game is too full of try hards that anyone joining isn't gonna have a ton of reasons to stay when cold war has an overall more enjoyable experience"
"Yet another ""Cold War bad"", ""MW good"" post."
CW bad MW good
"MW was the first solid Call of Duty game in a while (besides maybe BO4, but I didn�t play it). They are trying to make the game a battle pass service now, and that battle pass is for the newest game. I think they will learn from all of this as they are trying to manage MW, CW, and Warzone."
"Are you a comedian? Bo4 was probably the worst cod game other than ghosts. The problem with bo4 was that it was rushed, it didn�t have a campaign, all the maps were remasters and if u wanted to play on a new map you needed to pay extra for a season pass. I agree with everything else."
[deleted]
I think cod has peaked with Modern Warfare. I really can�t see any studio making a better title any time soon.
"Battlefield needs to heavily redeem themselves for the atrocity that was BFV.

BF1 was one of the best war games I ever played and I enjoyed it more then I've enjoyed any COD game since MW3 or BO1."
Literally no one was saying this during the games life cycle eveeyone hated it
I would agree. The only thing I like about cold war is their campaign mode and the zombies mode. Their multiplayer I'm not fond of compared to modern warfare.
I guess thanks for this comment. I haven�t played the campaign yet since I feel the same way as you about the multiplayer
"MW and CW both have their ups and downs. Mw has terrible map designs with great graphics and engine, CW is great map designs and worse graphics and engine. I can go on and on, but yeah"
It's almost like they should just combine them and commit to making one really solid good game rather then two subpar games every other year.
"Never...? Its not about popularity to Activision- its about ***Profitability***.  


CW sucks? Whatever. They still gotta sell it, and sell it better than every other COD has previously sold, ever. CW has showed us that actual game development, time management, and overall quality is second to ""new games sales numbers"". And Activision promises it's shareholders ""RECORD BREAKING PROFIT"" every time, no matter how unrealistic or unsustainable that is. And even if it does somehow break records like they promised, they will still layoff a bunch of their staff, just cause they're done with em.

[It happened in 2019, and it'll happen again](https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions), they'll never learn, because they don't have to."
"I wanted to like Cold War more than MW. I like the map design better for the most part and the revival of dead silence as a perk rather than a stupid field upgrade but he down grade in graphics, the bad hit detection, the horrible character movement, and the absolute garbage fire that is SBMM ruined it for me. I didn't care much for MW either but it at least got some things right that made it bearable. Cold War drove me back to Apex."
Modern warfare is trash
"I love Modern Warfare ngl, I really have been enjoying it the most since MW3, I even played it longer than any COD before. I bought Cold War and played the campaign, which was great and Zombies is Great as well but I quit the MP after 1 or 2 hours. I regret paying 60� for this game it just felt like a huge step back."
"Ohh, they know buddy. They have the data for concurrent players. They just want to shove in your face to buy the new Cod.

Their biggest nightmare is people not playing the current game"
Well then they must be waking up screaming since like half of CoD youtube is still uploading Modern Warfare halfway through february lol.
"They already know, that's why the pasted cold war season 1 all over modern warfare and changed the name to warzone as well as every time you launch cod the first thing you see is cold war."
"MW is indeed more popular than Cold War, numbers and all. People are still going to play the new COD regardless because it is new, different, and is not MW. Not everyone likes MW, myself included. The game is a little broken, especially after the integration and all, but people still play it nonetheless. There will always be people that play the newest cod & last years cod for next few years. It�ll eventually still receive more content and occasional updates for holiday events etc, just like BO3 did w Zombie Chronicles, Black Market weapons even after Infinite Warfare was out.. just like how IW still released a few more weapons even when cod WWII was out, and so on. The �previous� cod will still be alive and well even with the new one being out. That�s simply how it is...

Even with the success of MW�19, that won�t deter them from stopping and releasing cods every year. Yeah MW19 is popular, but that success won�t be lived on forever... I mean, look at Fortnite.. that game is still �popular�, but same time, is it really?"
Man that last sentence hit my brain real hard.
This is very much not an unpopular opinion OP lol
Bro...real talk. I hated mw when it came out so i played bo4 still.but the maps at the end mw made me feel like i lost a whole year. Mw was actually really good. But im loving the shit out of cold war.
How many damn times do i have to see the same post on this sub. Post something new and original for once
As I speak MW (not Warzone) has 50% more viewers than BOCW on twitch lmfao
They do know. That's why they are basically forcing it onto MW players.
Cope
I installed cold war again yesterday to play zombies. I got connection interupted every match 3 times in a row after 15 mins. Never installing cw again
"Raining down more than 15 cluster strikes at once!!
https://youtube.com/watch?v=lSK2Rp_kmSw&feature=share"
"I pre purchased Cold War as the first cod game I�ve bought new ever, I decided to pick up Modern Warfare since I�ve heard it�s great and my friends recommended it. I�ve been having a lot more fun with modern warfare than Cold War, besides zombies modern warfare is a better game in my opinion. If only the 0 weapon xp but was fixed and they stopped pushing Cold War so hard I�d enjoy it more. After seeing and hearing about how good modern warfare was I decided they would improve upon that so I pre ordered Cold War. I was disappointed in almost everything, the reload animations, map design, sound design, character design, colours, and even zombies to some degree."
"They�ll probably end up realizing that CW was a big flop financially.  Money drives the decisions, they�ll want to milk CW for now but on a go-forward basis I�d expect COD 2021 easily to be an MW2 since MW was so popular.  And for 2022.... I don�t know if they go back to black ops.... I�m thinking CW was a big financial disappointment.  They�ll want to make money.  They�re probably aware that COD 2021 has to be pretty good or some people are gonna permanently write off the series.  This is the kinda game people buy every year, so your loyal customers are really what matters.  Perhaps we can hinge on even though customer satisfaction doesn�t seem to be a priority for them, at least our dollars have spoken and they want our dollars so they�ll Kinda do what we want a little."
"Was so disapointed when i first played CW(with the exception of zombies, best part of CW by a mile) MW knovked it out of the park in just about every sense, ESPECIALLY with the attachment system in terms of looks and weapon performance, i mean they basically got rid of the best things about the attachment system in MW and replaced it with nonsensical new aspects, NO tac laser, barrels that increase damage to vehicles but not players, no trigger attachments, no tactical/commando foregrips and everything is a handle which looks stupid IMO,etc etc., i just feel like there is less loadout versaitilty in CW, definately a step back from Mw attachments, and of course dropshotting is slow AF(only with the right griptape of course) and no more mounting or opening doors, not sure why those changes were even made, glad i played the free trials and didnt buy CW, if zombies comes out as a stbadalone ill buy that, otherwise i dont feel like im missing out on much."
"I really would like to know the official player count on both games. 
Ps:
Thank you for your last sentence. There are so much people here who start a discussion, don�t discuss but tell anyone who has another opinion that they should fuck off..."
Just watched a video by JGOD and he didn't talk about the zero xp stuff but he mentioned that infinity ward who is in charge of MW are working on the next game while the other 2 companies are CW and Warzone so it seems like it will or never be fixed since MW is focused on other stuff. This is BS.
Cold War multiplayer is trash.  The campaign is pretty good.
"This posts make since, mw has a more realistic vibe to it, Cold War is more arcade vibes. But it�s been like this forever lol modern warfare tends to attract more passive players (aka campers and sound whores)"
"All I see from this sub is people bitching about Cold War, how did you think that might be an unpopular opinion?!"
Now post the same thing in a different sub.
"They don't care and they will never care. They release a CoD every year and its quality does not matter. It only matters if copies get sold.

As long as people keep buying the game, they'll keep doing a yearly release where every 3rd one or so is gold."
"Cold War was one big disappointment because mw was my first cod I bought and when someone said that new cod is coming I was hyped about buying it because I thought that it's gonna look similar to mw. Because I wasn't never guy who was focusing on storyline so graphics, details and style of movement is most important thing to me. And I didn't know that cw gonna have different studio from mw. So me and my friends (who started playing mw with me) were hyped to buy new cod. When I saw first ingame video I thought it's meme because the game just looked so bad. But few weeks later I realized that the game really looks like this. So I still wanted to buy it because I wanted to try story and multiplayer. I remember how first free trial comes out on ps4 and I played it with my friend and we were talking about how the game feels and how balanced the weapons are but in our minds we both know that the game is just bad. I played all trials then and I end up that I don't want to buy this game. 

So no I don't want to buy your cod mobile- sorry I mean cold war."
"So you claim that MW is more popular than Cold War, but then preface your next claim by saying that it's an unpopular opinion? What?"
"Cold War is selling better right now. Opinions on gameplay and which one is better aside, Cold War is simply making them more money at the present moment."
Cold War is now in the top 20 best selling video games of all time in the US. They know what they�re doing. People are buying CW just like they�ll buy the next MW.
"When will this sub get over itself lol. They do this every single year, now all of a sudden everyone is shook? Now, THAT�S an unpopular opinion"
Yeah it's too bad. Recently went back to Modern Warfare and noticed a lot of the casual base has jumped ship. Just a bunch of people with spr rifles and mp5s trying to level up their battle pass in MW for Cold War is my theory. Hard to find a fun game.
This is how cod is every tear the old game stops getting support whole the new game gets all the support and the same thing will happen when cold war is at the end of its life cycle
Lmao CW is the the top selling game
Yeah because they put it on sale a few weeks after launch. Also they put it back on sale very recently (idk about ps4/pc).
Its not tho?
"I agree cold war is a complete waste of money, it should not have been merged with MW.. i hate seeing advertisements in a game i paid for, they are trying to leech players off MW player base.
Black Opps serious died after Black Opps 2 (best Black Opps game to date)"
"Didn't buy CW not going to or any other future cods MW is my last one. Not because I hate cod but because it's a waste money buying literally the same game every year just with a different brand, not to mention let's be honest they've become a shitty franchise. A shitty franchise which I no longer wish to buy from."
"They know, that�s why they are pushing Cold War so hard."
yeah the graphics and animations in cold war are dogshit
"Graphics are fine, the lighting isnt realistic, but MW games have always been more realistic than black ops games"
Yeah the animations feel very clunky
Disagree.
"Cold War is more popular than MW, but warzone is more popular than Cold War."
"They already know but what do you expect them to do,abandon their new game for the first time ever and go back to the old one?That�s just ridiculous"
Apart from they don't care about Cold War neither most of the challenges force you to play Warzone instead to unlock stuff in Black Ops lol
"I can't believe that this would need to be explained. The people who make these games and oversee the production at the publisher know for a cold hard fact which of the games is more popular. What they're concerned with is the $60 retail they can make from a new COD release then the money they can make from the game as a service model in microtransactions following that. The simple fact is that while there will be a MW faithful they would be braindead to not release a new COD to hit people's wallets for over $300,000,000 plus the additional revenue from add ons. It's like saying, when are companies going realise that my feelings are more important than 1 billion USD. It's not going to happen."
"Bro they do this every release. 

* COD2 awesome
* Cod3 sucks 
* Cod4 awesome
* Cod5 / wow rubbish
* Mw2 awesome
* Blops rubbish
* Mw3 okish
* Blops 2 dogshit
* Ghosts pretty good
* Advanced warfare shit
* Modern warfare fucking A
* Cold War rubbish
* Next installment of modern warfare probably gonna be ace."
finally someone who admires ghosts
Did you really not like WaW or Blops?
"For me, all the games have been fun to play with friends, and none have been outright *bad*, but I definitely prefer the Infinity Ward games overall. Here are my thoughts:

- *Call of Duty* - Haven't played it

- *Call of Duty 2* - Decent, but not great. Probably really good for its time, but I first played it in 2010 as part of [the War Collection](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_The_War_Collection) instead of in 2005 when it first released

- *Call of Duty 3* - Same as 2. One thing that was awesome for me is that part of the campaign follows Canadian soldiers

- *Call of Duty 4* - Great game. Modern setting instead of WWII was a really nice change, and (as far as I know) was the first majorly successful shooter to do it

- *World at War* - Pretty good. Felt similar to 4, but set in WWII again

- *MW2* - Amazing. Still one of the best campaigns in the series

- *Black Ops* - Decent. Like *Call of Duty 4*'s modern setting, the Cold War setting was something that not many other shooters (if any) had done at the time, and added a little more variety on top of WWII, modern, or future/sci-fi

- *MW3* - Great, but pretty much just more of the same from MW2. A decent end to the trilogy

- *Black Ops II* - Okay campaign, fun multiplayer, especially with friends. This is the first one I was able to actually play a decent amount online thanks to getting better internet. Up to this point, it was mostly only campaign and local multiplayer (split-screen and system link)

- *Ghosts* - Good gameplay, okay campaign. The space mission was cool, and I loved the introduction of DMRs as a dedicated weapon class. This is where I started playing mainly hardcore instead of core

- *Advanced Warfare* - Not bad, but it started the annoying double-jumping and wall-running trend that stuck around for the next few games

- *Black Ops III* - I remember the campaign being fun, but not much else about it. Not very memorable to me... Multiplayer was fine, but I never liked that the double-jumping and wall-running was pretty much needed for you to be decent

- *Infinite Warfare* - I liked the campaign, but the multiplayer was like *BO3*. While it felt a lot better to play, the movement mechanics were still annoying

- *WWII* - Great game. To me, it was the best since the *Modern Warfare* trilogy. Great campaign, great multiplayer. Loved that it went back to boots on the ground gameplay instead of keeping the movement mechanics from the previous few games

- *Black Ops 4* - Never played it. It doesn't have a campaign, so I skipped it. Later got it through Humble Monthly, but still haven't bothered even installing it

- *Modern Warfare (2019)* - The best campaign so far in my opinion. My current favourite, and easily the best-feeling *Call of Duty*. Some of [the recent changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lfbwha/does_anybody_know_why_these_changes_were_made/) are annoying to me, but it's still my favourite, even with Activision trying to push everyone to *Warzone* and *Cold War* instead

 - *Warzone* - Not really a fan of battle royale games. If I had to choose any to play though, it would be this one. It's just Modern Warfare with some battle royale mechanics added on top

- *Cold War* - Campaign was good, and the multiplayer is fine. I enjoy it, but coming from *Modern Warfare* though, it just doesn't feel great to play... The character models don't look as good, the animations aren't as good, the hitboxes seem inconsistent to me (I shot a good distance beside someone and still hit them from pretty far away, and I couldn't hit another that I was directly aiming at from across the room), etc. Again, not *bad*, but pretty disappointing compared to *MW2019*"
[deleted]
Warzone had the best zombie mode eva.
Man the quickscoping on cold war is so trash
"They both suck MW is nothing without Warzone, the only thing keeping it going."
The latter. Integration happens at Activision
"So I was able to link my Xbox profile to my Battle.net. But when I login from my Battle.net on PC, in the title screen it is still asking me to purchase MW. Any thoughts ?"
did they fix reticles and hitmarkers on Warzone yet? they break something new with every 'update'
"i havent got on today yet, but whats the playlist update? also the weapon xp fix might come thursday NIGHT. just being hopeful. thats when they usually roll out patches"
"[https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lhqocz/full\_mw\_playlist\_update\_11feb2021\_onslaughter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lhqocz/full_mw_playlist_update_11feb2021_onslaughter/)

&#x200B;

Hopefully they fix it so I can start my camo grind again."
Activision doesn�t give a single fuck about their community they only care about profit
Same here. Absolutely  ridiculous  .
For someone like me that�s been around this franchise since call of duty big red one seeing it go to shit like this is absolutely heartbreaking I�m seriously hoping BF6 is the break we all need
"Unfortunately, EA has also damaged DICE almost beyond all recognition. I've watched that happen over the past 15+ years with the BF franchise. Very said what these moneyed corporate interests do. They squeeze the life out of these franchises and destroy gaming communities more and more with each iteration. Expectations couldn't be lower for BF6."
All we know: [https://trello.com/b/jLwmgJbt/black-ops-cold-war-warzone](https://trello.com/b/jLwmgJbt/black-ops-cold-war-warzone)
"Lol no hit markers, no exp notification at end of match, wack af playlist, but I get a free bundle?
And it�s basically a fucking roach? THANKSSS"
I have a feeling the playlist updates would just be on an automatic schedule and wouldn�t have anything to do with any fixes
"Sucks that Bizzardvision dropped the handles on this game. MW19 should be thriving. Just think, they will be pumping out another game in about 10 months. 

Get your preorders in now boys! /s"
I bought modern warfare yesterday since it was on sale and since I figured out I wasn�t earning any level XP I assumed they were purposely doing this to push Cold War and to kill modern warfare
"Everytime I tried to play Infected Ground War the game would freeze after 5 minutes and time out, did anyone else have this problem?"
They can but they won't.
"I think you're assuming a whole lot more common sense and decency to a publisher that's taken every opportunity to show how little they care.

More likely we'll get a 15-minute double XP token and free bundle only redeemable in Cold War."
"IIf they have records logged of how much we earned and were SUPPOSED to get, they might as well just push it back to us. people who played for hours and didnt get anything could actually be rewarded"
If they fix it*
It would be a republican to think they won�t fix the glitch.
"Ok, I did some ad hoc testing:

*Weapon XP:*

* Hopped into a HC match, got 1 kill, quit (sorry team) - 0 XP
* Hopped into a Ground War match - got 3 kills, game ended (Defcon) - [31 XP per kill](https://ibb.co/cCDQhYc)

No idea how it's tracking - you might get it after match completion or you might get it only by playing Ground War. If someone is willing to test a bit on their side, it would be appreciated.

*Also* \- people who are downvoting this post - don't bother. I'm making these updates as a service for those who uninstalled. I'm not a developer, just a dude. Cheers."
Upvote for the information. Thanks.
"I made another round of testing - this time in Warzone Rumble (which is *kind of* linked to MP (assuming the missions/challenges)

* XP for CW guns tracks straight away after a kill (+ 125)
* XP for MW guns track after the game (+ 125)

So, the only way to get consistent weapon XP at the moment is by playing Rumble or other Warzone modes. MP is very inconsistent and mostly totally broken."
"It's exactly the same bug as the entire past week, no changes. You randomly get like 250 xp even for 50 kills, or zero, or 24 xp. 

so no fix, no acknowledgment of the issue."
does the bug also impact warzone?
"Here, take our upvotes!"
Garbage. Always garbage...
" it's not sts but onslaught is fun,try it if you can."
They�ll only put shoothouse and shipment when they think it�s time
"But the question is, did they fix bugs? No"
My automatic load out keeps falling out of the map on rebirth lol sucks getting mowed down with m13s while I have a pistol
Haven�t even acknowledged them yet.
"Warzone Rumble

Nice. That's the mode that got me to buy MW"
[deleted]
"I love rumble, its the mode that really made me love sniping"
"Rumble is how I got good with the AX50

19,000 kills, 4.7kd 15+ nukes with AX50 since"
Man why can't they at least pretend to care about us
Lol. I expected nothing but disappointment and still managed to get disappointed.
Lmao same
i just want shoot the ship back :(
Well as long as I can level up my guns gonna be happy for the week
Did they fix the xp bug?
"I can't be 100 % sure, but it was working well for me today."
It�s still not working
I played a game after update but still no weapon XP for me
I miss Ready to Mingle: Rust 6v6
Bring back livestock!
Yet no shoot the ship...
I mean it did just leave. And don�t get me wrong I don�t play unless shoot the ship is up but it�s a bit early to expect it back
"HOLY SHIT YESSSSSS

I fucking LOVE reinforce. Like, I even play it with bots. I somehow managed to miss it EVERY SINGLE TIME it's been in rotation so this is first time I'll get to play it with people since Ghosts. 

Sure this sub will hate it because it's not StS, but man I love this playlist update. Last few have been good

They should keep doing this weekly rotation of past modes, maybe put small map or StS on weekends to make this sub happy"
I have to agree with you on reinforce. I played this when I first bought the game a year ago and could never remember wtf it was called. I ended up thinking it was just cyber attack or that I was going crazy
I might be the only one but reinforced ground war was fun
Can confirm XP isn't fixed for everyone. I still am not gaining any XP on my weapons. Gonna scan and repair and see if that miraculously fixes it. Worked back last year.
"doing the work of the gods, thank you for doing this. helps out a lot for me"
"You are very welcome, I'm glad someone can make use of this!"
Onslaughter was a fun mode from the Halloween event.  Are Jugg pumpkin heads returning too?
"wait, wait, wait... I have been trying to level up a couple of guns in MW MP... and you're telling me that NOTHING is happening? :-("
Hit markers still broken?
"Me and my buddy reinforce, yay!"
Reinforce needs more people..games way too short
DOGSHIT DOGSHIT DOGSHIT DOGSHIT!!!!
"Aw man, am I gonna miss all or nothing. Hope it comes back on the regular maps soon!"
am i the only one that gets no xp and no gun camos on rumble?
Even though reinfected ground war is great mode in some ways I'm glad they removed it cause in two maps the game would freeze and crash especially when I got the juggernaut it happened. It's interesting they brought back onslaughter. I like that mode.
Onslaughter is a pretty good game mode. Was able to grind out Uzi gold camo playing only that.
oh boy more garbage
" every week or two i will boot this game on ps5 and it makes me  re  download the map packs over and over again. this just happened to me   again one hour ago even after the latest patch. has there been any   official word from infinity ward about fixing this? i went over my data   cap last month because of this, i probably downloaded 200gbs of the  same  thing over and over. is there any fix? thanks guys"
Warzone Rumble back!? Let�s Gooooo!!!
But XP for guns... No. I remember when i was playing rumble frist time i was able to unlock jak-12 and i did it and i can boost my wepons but now... I buy morden warfare 4 days ago and i ulocked 2 Guns: rytec Amr and rkm (i dont remember his name) i did So much kils on guns i was using to unlock other guns +200 kils and i got the same level. Sorry for bad English.
"Use the Renetti to unlock Akimbo, its a text error"
That's wild lol I really was annoyed. Thanks a lot!
I second that. Just unlocjed it 5 mins ago
sykov not out yet
this happens to me too
Got me at the end!
"the menu and XP glitches are happening to everyone but I still 100% agree with you, i play on a ps4 slim and throughout the year everything was going pretty fine but ever since the integration, textures barely load, I love ground war but every time I enter the game the ground looks like mush for the whole game. i have been looking at old/new clips and comparing them, MW def got a graphics downgrade over the past couple months"
"Hit marker thing is a bug that is worked on, but I totally agree that the performance has gone to shitter because of the poor optimazing. MW was better year ago."
guys cold war treyarch bad modern warfare infinity ward good amaright???!?!? give me fake internet clout please
[deleted]
"mw good, cw bad, gimme karma"
No.
Yae that's true.
Throwback to when each game took up each amount of space on the screen
Me when I saw you fatties crying about no new content
i don't think ATVI is going to be really spending any money towards MW even tho MW made them a lot of money it's all prob going to CW now
Yeah peak hours on both games are terrible. The stutter is unreal even hardwired with the fastest internet possible through verizon. It's like 150 bucks a month. My downloads and other games are amazing. Cod unfortunately not so much. Cheap asses with the servers.
"i'm gonna be honest with you, $150 verizon internet is probably slower that sending the data in a written letter to the servers."
"i've never had server issues in this game before, but today the entire lobby jumps to a 200-250 ping at the same time, and happened numerous times, this better not become normal"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lfsfba/man_i_miss_pre_cold_war_mw_multiplayer/gmomoma/

Maybe it's regional thing, seems like EU has no lag.  In NA it's pretty bad.  I heard in Aus it's bad too."
"My activision account got unlinked, meaning I lost all my progress in all CoD, and I'm pretty annoyed about it.  I assumed I was ""hacked"" but the more I think about it, the more I believe they just nuked my account during some server maintenance or something."
" 

I just want to play your game like I did before where I could play for hour uninterrupted. I forget what patch it was now becuase I stopped playing for a few months now. But since that one patch the only other thing I have changed is my ram and I constantly get disc read errors.

I remember months back trying to find solutions or any acknowledgement of the issue on your part and found nothing. I've tried all the fixes that have and have not worked for others with the same issue to no avail. 

I just want an answer a proper fix from your end, and not "" Have you tried scan and repair? or have you tried reinstalling? "" YES I have multiple times. And everytime I maybe get a game or 2 in and then insert random disc read error since they always seem to be different. Its bad enough there are dev errors but those I have been able to get under control with fixes from others. 

I just wonder why multiple patches since I played last and I even did a refresh install just last night. How can it be I upgrade my ram from 16 to 32 and it breaks the game lol."
"Same as you, mid to late night my game stuck in fetching online info or unable to connect :("
It�s also due to mw dogshit netcode
Guessing you have cable internet? And don't understand how things work?
"Def not my internet. Speed tests don't show any substantial differences at different times of day for me, and this issue has been widely reported by people who aren't on my internet connection."
Aim assist or not idc this was still hella clean almost nutted had to hold my self back
What's that kar loadout

"so recently I had to reinstall my OS, and now i can't install MW only Warzone and the ""new"" engine sound for cars is used for wheelson, plus there no grenade launcher sound"
wheelson has had that sound for a while...i have no idea why
The wheelson is so bad man... I�ve gotta stop using it
raven is in charge of bug fixes
Activision would have such a profitable only fans from the amount of times they've fucked the community in the ass.
Hope its shoot the ship. Btw does anyone know which weapons you have to get gold to get platinum for Kilo?
You need first 8 assault rifles to get platinum for all ARS you have gold
Why did yall vote for shoot D ship
Grinding Damascus?
I�m fucking praying for shoot the ship
"Rumour has it that the 2021 CoD is being made by SHG. Not sure how true that is, but it would make sense. So you�d be waiting until 2022 for MW2."
"There�s also rumours that it�s developed by IW, so until we get confirmation, it�s up in the air.

But for now I�m believing it to be an IW game considering how SHG was working on BOCW but got put aside to a supporting role in favour of Treyarch."
"CoD games don't typically release until Fall. If you can wait that long, great. I personally find that $60 stretched between 8 months is not a bad value. The XP bug will be fixed, and until it is I don't suggest purchasing, but I've still been having fun with it otherwise. There are a myriad of aesthetically pleasing skins, you can check them all out at [https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/loot?c=2](https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/loot?c=2)"
there is a rumour about a mw2 multiplayer remaster being released around may time
"Not sure how I feel about that tbh. COD4 remastered worked because it's COD4. Games a classic, and quite different to modern COD. MW2 is a great game but I don't know if it needs a full remaster. I still play it on PC. It's fun but I can't see how it'll play in 2021. Plus if it's the same engine as the campaign it won't play as nice as MW19"
"I'd rather it not be mw2. Modern warfare had a 3 year development didn't it? I'd rather they take their time and give us another great game, unlike cold war lol"
nah i refuse to believe they didnt reuse the mw engine
"and most of that time was spent on the new engine, which they now have"
God that thing is overpowered. Good clip tho
"yep. ruined the game next to the VAAL, Mp5, and Mp7"
I can assure you that it�s not as OP as the clip makes it out to be. If you only knew about the amount of hit markers I get with this thing sometimes..
"Fucking clickbaiter, change the title to �8 kills in 25.3 seconds�. Pussy"
meh
1v1 me on rust bro!!!11
Good job mate
Damn you�re still getting XP? I�m still not getting any in any game modes
"Nope, the footage is from about a week ago"
The people usually shoot back at me
Seems like this clip hit a nerve with some people. I promise you all it�s not THAT deep. Go cry somewhere else
meh
"For some reason, I dont have that many equipment slots. It only has the sights, muzzle, underbarrel, and perk slots. Am I missing something? Or do I need to level it up to change the ammo type, barrel, and stock?"
"You need to get it to max level to begin with. The equipments I use are: 
Barrel: SP-R 26�
Optic: Solozero SP-R 28mm
Stock: XRK SP-LITE 208 BLITZ
Ammo: .338 Laupa mag 5-R
Bolt Assembly: Sloan KR-600 Feather"
So is the xp and hit markers back now then?
I'm not getting xp for the spr anyone know a solution
Dog setup
Impressive ((:
Diamond hard scope
Aaaand thats why I dont play anymore.
"Welcome to the 'blow into left analogue stick every 30 seconds' club, its nice to have you here"
"Yes, but my controller (left stick on PS4) was, in fact, broken."
Think it might have to do with tab or hold to slide being buggy.
I am. I thought it was just my controller messing up but sometimes it seems it�s faster to just disable auto sprint. Stopped getting stuttering when I do it manually but I think it�s a bug
Yup the games getting dry I feel the same but with maps and their shit playlist
Easily could be fixed by just supporting the game with making good playlists. But they can�t because all the focus is on Cold War.
"Ive seen similar posts before, this must be a console thing. I start up the game select MW on the right and i don't get harrassed by cold war at all."
"Man search here in Reddit, tons of ppl have the same problem"
"Sorry I didn't think of that right away, never hurts to ask a question. Isn't that what this site/ app is for ? Typical everyone's catching a attitude like I'm the idiot. Garbage cod community like always"
"Help, not using the search function."
Not sure what your riddle means...
Uninstall and reinstall the game a couple times. Fixed the bug for me.
[removed]
Started happening to me last night on S&D
We all know it's not gonna happen cuz they've literally forgotten about mw
"Lol, I wonder how big the outrage will be when they release MW2 when none of the micro transactions carry over."
I don�t think anyone is expecting they would transfer over
This!!!
"That's a great and frequently-requested idea.  Likewise, if I swap out a part on a blueprint, it would be nice if that new part retained the blueprint paint color."
"Hopefully, this will be something they implement going forward into future titles. Right now it would require massive changes to code to disjoint tracers from their assigned blueprints, add another category for customization, and (not so much) to allow tracers on any assigned weapon. The amount of work required is not something a company that focuses on pumping out titles as fast as possible will find worth their time. They've already been working on the 2021 title, and likely 2022."
I want to put dark tracers on my og.
On your OG what??? May I ask??
nah not gonna happen
"It's not even just weapon xp either, hit markers aren't showing up, operator challenges are getting no progress, they really fucked it up this time"
This and more
The hit markers has me fucked up
"Ive got these operator challenges which seem to be from season 1 of modern warfare, they wont progress so Im wondering if theyre not legit and just showing up, or theyre legit and wont progress."
Not to mention these weird bubbles appearing on when using certain scopes!
"Not to mention sight reticles have loading screens lol, half the time I zoom in to shoot someone theres a loading circle thing"
Same here but getting like 200 xp for 20 bombs
operator challenges for Rodion and Wyatt haven�t tracked for me in weeks
They don't care.
No wonder people aren't buying Cold War... Fuck the Battle Pass too. Hope BF6 does to Activision what the community did to EA...
"I tried to post a way to force them to respond but literally no upvotes...we need to go wallstreetbets on them and all file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission. They can�t purposely destroy a product we paid for to get us to switch. Apple got fined millions for doing this to consumes by slowing down old iPhone performance.

https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lg401q/file_a_formal_complaint_with_the_federal_trade/"
"If it isn't pertaining to warzone, they don't care."
Another way to put it is that they care about mw2 more to divert man hours to fix old game bugs.
They wanted people to buy Cold War by comparison of how bad Modern Warfare was looking after the update.
"Obviously they don't care, dark matter has had complete shit coverage for 90% of the guns for months now. Such a simple fix"
I've literally spent the past week trying max out my FR 5.56 and Stella but cuz of this bug they've only gone up  about 2 levels
Thought I was going fucking crazy ive logged over 400 kills with the PILA trying for gold and its only at level 7
"At this point i'm just trying to finish out camo's for guns i've either maxed out or close to maxed out, so I can actually make some progress somewhere. But that will only last me so long until I run out of runway with the camos. 

It's super frustrating."
Exactly! I've wasted like 2 XP Tokens now trying rank mine up. Not to mention all the time spent after grueling days of work...
I decided to finally get the finn. Got it and then they broke the game. Been stuck on level 7 for a week. Wasted a couple double xp tokens in the beginning because I didn�t know what was happening. I was hoping on them fixing it today but clearly they just don�t care.
Why have you been trying for a week if it very clearly isn't working?
"My advice is to do plunder supply runs, since those still give XP, and do the challenges afterwards."
I just thought it was really hard to level up launchers good to know it�s not just me. But XP works in Warzone you can do plunder hot drops to level up quickly.
"I purchased the game on Friday. It's been broken the entire time I've owned it. I just tried to refund the game and was met with request rejected because it's been more than 72 hours since purchase. I clicked ""appeal"" and it just refreshed me to a blank page (of course).

I tried to contact customer support where they used to have a call back option. Now the only option is a web ticket. Guess they got me this time...."
"Bait and switch man I'm telling you. If this is how they treat their customers then they can keep their fucking product. And the only thing they respond with on twitter is ""Have you tried clearing your cache?"""
"Same boat.  I just bought the game on PS4 last week because it�s 25% off and I haven�t purchased a COD since Black Ops 2.  I�m stuck at rank 1 with the ridiculous preset load outs and can�t change them.

What a damn waste."
"If you paid with a credit card, consider doing a chargeback. You paid for a product that is not working as advertised."
Try to refund it through your purchasing option.
I�m really sorry I never got to see it in it�s prime.  Best cod I�ve ever played
I purchased this game at launch and it's also been broken the entire time I've owned it too lmao
"same, purchased the game like 2 - 3 days ago when it got a discount, so far I have found only glitches, no weapon xp, bugged operator missions. Im fucking pissed"
You fucked up this game was amazing season 3-6
[deleted]
Is anyone not getting XP at all for the last week or so I can�t level up or level up in the battle pass
Everybody isn�t getting any XP right now mate...
This only way I can level guns up now is plunder or warzone which is bullshit
"Nope, I�ve been level 113 for the past week. And I spent all of my double weapon xp tokens trying to see if that would work and nothing"
"I wasn't earning any XP or gun XP on PS4.  Switch over to Xbox One (still same Activision account) and I was earning XP.  Then tried it on PC, and I was earning XP again as well.  Looks like I'm just not playing on my main console for the time being"
"I was gaining a little in multiplayer then it stopped. So I went to co-op to test it and got my last required levels on my deagle and ebr14 very quickly in survival mode.

I then equipped two more guns I needed to level and tested spec ops on the bank mission. Managed to level them up fast to what I needed, though I already had mo'money available on both."
"i'm getting level XP just not getting any Weapon XP.. just started going for camos and i can't really continue since i'm not able to fucking level anything up.  
Fuck the Cold War collab. The game is dog shit and has brought nothing but bugs and fuck ups to MW"
That is definitely disappointing to see the state of the game. All so activision can tout their newest game that is far worse ruining Modern Warfare that many still want to play and enjoy.
"Another thing that's broken: Operators' Missions. I'm currently playing as Ghost and I'm stuck at ""Use the Dead Silence field upgrade 5 times with Ghost as your Coalition Operator"".

I've played several matches. I've used the field upgrade more than 10 times. Guess what? My progress is still 0/5 -\_-"
Same thing to me exact same operator so frustrating. I'm done with Activision never again
"Yeah - I got the same issue, trying the operator mission with Wyatt.
I'm on xbox and nothing happens.."
Is anyone else getting very small amounts of normal xp. Yesterday I only got 250 for winning a match and dropping 26 kills in tdm
"See for me my Level XP is alright, it�s just the Weapon XP..."
"Yes, 250XP exactly after a whole game of ground war going 59-8"
They killed an amazing COD game
they don�t care or they did it on purpose. They don�t want this game to retain players. They will do anything they can to entice you to buy the newer game.
"They should at least stop selling the game if that's what they doing. Had it for a month, a measly month.. waste of money."
"Neeeeever going to happen, I only bought this cod (the first I have bought in ten years) because it was on sale for like $20 at the start of  lockdown last year. And I only reinstalled it a week ago because shoot the ship was back. But I reinstalled bf1 and have been having far more fun there tbf"
"It�s like they knew there was no feasible reason to play CW multiplayer over MWs, so they shot MW in the head lol"
It's honestly so annoying. Have to do it through plunder
Same here... Just unlocked the SP-R and been trying to level up... Maybe that's the plan? Force people into Warzone so we can buy their shitty battle pass...
can't even do it there for me lolol
"If it were a bug that caused a game crash when performing a certain action, i�d be okay if they take their time to fix it. If it were gun camos glitching and not loading properly, i�d be okay if they took their time.  But XP is such a fucking fundamental part of the game, it is such a massive component in practically all games, it blows my fucking mind that this abhorrent, incompetent company manages to fuck that up. Enough with this �thEyrE jUst aN inDie cOmpaNy� jokes, this shit that they�re pulling is absolutely disgusting."
hAvE yOu TrIeD cLeArInG yOuR cAcHe???
"Got this game on sunday so i could use mw weapons in warzone with upgrades, but then i was like: damn, upgrading weapons takes a long time. Took me 5 hours before i realized it was broken. They still havent fixed it so i havent touched the game at all"
Imagine! People prefer this game over that new shitty Cold War and this is the price we pay for not shelling out even more money for a shittier game I suppose...
"I bought it for the same reason (along with just enjoying multiplayer), and I had like one day of blissful curbstomping on Shipment before that and weapon XP all went away."
"Can someone explain why my posts on reddit get all blocked? i tried to do so many post on reddit but all get blocked for no reason, even my friendly posts"
This
Mine too. Idk why
This is driving me fucking nuts. I have been chugging away at my CMAX for days and it will randomly level up a TINY bit of XP. I have played 40+ games with top 1-3 placement on my team and the gun is still at level 3.
They better catch up all that XP if they ever manage to get a damn patch out. Otherwise they can say goodbye to my business for another 5 years...
"Thee is no weapon xp for kills the only time I get any xp on any weapon seems to be when I'm playing obj game like hard point or dom and get attacker/defender kills, then i get the 25xp bonus or whatever it is. I have had weapons where I have got 300-400 kills and have not moved from level 16 up to 17."
"This is so weird - I mean even Charlie Intel keeps silent on this bug, and recently they have been reporting all tiny bugs and glitches in Warzone."
"There is for some weeks now a weapon bug so that you cant get any XP from killing people. I tried to do many post but all got blocked for no reason. I made like 2000 kills on some weapons and got no XP and that is realy sad. There are many players that cant get XP but i must say that i think this Bug exist only on Modern Warfare for PC. My friends play on the PS4 and they dont have this issue. 

I think they are all on vacation. Otherwise I can't explain to myself how long it takes to fix this bug."
"That's not right. I don't get XP on my  ps4 or ps5, my brother do on PC"
nor do i on xbox
I�m on Xbox and I can�t get XP
"Yea I�ve been having the same problems not just with my weapons leveling but also my rank as well. I�ve found that I only level when I use certain weapons, as I�ve been stuck on rank 22 for the past 2 weeks. I�ve been playing MW on Xbox since launch in 2019 and stopped playing Xbox about 2 months before the PS5 dropped. When I got back on MW on my ps5, I saw that my rank was at 1. I didn�t think too much of it because I saw all over that Cold War and MW were going to be linked, however it�s becoming a problem as I cannot rank up. I still have everything unlocked along my platinum smg�s and my classes weren�t messed up. It�s just annoying seeing no progress being gained from the matches I play. Maybe the switch from the original Xbox one to ps5 did something but the devs need to fix it!"
This shit has me fucked up dude. I just started playing this game like 2 weeks ago and I was only able to level like 3 guns.
"Fucking unreasonable man... the thing I don�t get is, if people are still buying the game, why the fuck are you trying to nerf it? Let people play ffs"
Activision is fucking pathetic and literally only cares about making money through their precious in game purchases. They know how dedicated a player base they have which means they can be greedy little fucks and treat us like garbage. Absolutely no respect for dedicated fans/players. Fuck you Activision.
"From their 2020 Q4 earning's call:

""Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty and has a fantastic pipeline of in-game content ahead across all platforms. We will benefit from a full year of Warzone, driving upgrades to our premium content and incremental in-game player investment. *And we have a substantial opportunity to* ***continue migrating the community*** *to Black Ops Cold War*, as well as another strong premium release planned for Q4 in 2021."""
Good luck to them! I will never buy that fucking game... whether I buy the next few after that will depend on whether or not they fix this...
"It�s an absolute disservice to the people that bought the full codmw game and have warzone be the only workaround for infinity ward�s xp fuck up. Someone needs to do their job and fix the game, or they will go somewhere else for their gaming entertainment. Other issues got fixed before most people knew they were even there, such as store exploits etc, anything where the customer gained anything or had too much fun was nerfed/fixed. Fix this. I�ve already spent $20 on other games so that I don�t have to deal with this crap for the rest of the year. Ridiculous."
"Exactly, I hope BF6 will shake things up. If BF5 were still around there wouldn�t be this kind of shit that we�re getting now..."
I think it�s affecting PS4 players only it�s doing my head in. I�d better get all my XP backdated!
"Nah, xboi here. My FiNN has been stuck 4 levels shy of max level for days now grrr"
Quick question. Are hitmakers still non-appearant in the game?
Yes in some games it comes back but mostly non existent
At least my hdr and m4a1 are max level so imma try for gold
Don�t post stuff like this the mods will ban you.         #FUCK ACTIVISION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
activision is shit thats why
This is why cod is so fucking ass and why I haven�t played it since before Cold War came out
The real question is why the fuck is there still no cx-9
They�re too busy with something called wArZoNE
You shouldn't buy CW. We should vote with our wallets tbh
"So that�s why my bruen wasn�t leveling up, I wasted so many xp tokens :("
"Wait, so you guys just aren't getting weapons xp? Wtf, I'm not getting standard experience from matches either on top of no weapon xp! My blue bar after games doesn't even budge anymore. Ive been lucky enough that daily challenges exp works but that's it. Not to mention the operator challenges are bugged as well. This type of intentional demolishing of a game to push new game sells should be illegal."
"Im getting standard xp, the problem for me is weapon xp, also the operator challenges like you mention. 

""This type of intentional demolishing of a game to push new game sells should be illegal""

Totally agree to this, but that won't happen"
"Because unless it involves MTX they don't care. They haven't for a long time even before Cold War came out. Then when CW did it just made it blatantly obvious they were full sending a money grab from this franchise.   


Remember in the first few months of the game they made 1 Billion Dollars from sales/MTX and then invested only back into MTX.   


For fucks sake some PC Players have still had to UNDERCLOCK their GPU's since the the damn fucking Beta or the game pulls an error and crashes.   


How can you pull in $1,000,000,000 in the first few months alone and not be able to fix a bug that has been there since Beta? Fuck Activision and this game. They got me back into COD with Modern Warfare while also ensuring I never buy another one of their games."
Exactly what I said... if this is properly addressed they can kiss my ass goodbye to this one and every COD for atleast the next 5 years... what the fuck kind of precedent are they setting? Actively fucking paying customers?
i have the same problem on ps4 and I'm still waiting to fix it
Ironically some guys on PS say their shit is fine... unless someone is lying or this is a wilder screwup than we thought...
I have some weapon xp coins I got that are 15 minutes. I can't remember exactly how but I think I just had one good game and I got one from a mission achievement I can't remember
Even if you use the coins they�re worthless... 0 x 2 for 45 mins is still 0 man
"Let's all get together and start a class action lawsuit against them for theft. We paid, they took it away without permission"
"Is this for Warzone/Plunder as well, or only multiplayer?"
"Only way im getting xp is for completing challenges.

Its killing any of my motivation to play the game when im not getting rewarded or progressing, funny thing is some of my friends are still getting XP

If they dont fix it soon i might just join cold war"
My weapon could works when I use the base gun but if I use any blueprints then xp is fucked. Still bullshit though
If I was a dev at IW I would be furious.
"I was just thinking that now would be the ""perfect"" time to release the Sykov and CX-9, if you wanted to troll the community."
Its intentional. My guess is not enough people migrated to cold war and now Activision is forcing Infinity Ward to force us out of modern warfare. If EA fucks up BF6 i dont know what first person shooter to turn to.
You shouldn't have to do this but I had to go to warzone or plunder to level up my weapons just popped a double weapon xp and do contracts.
"It's weird how bugs like this ""takes time"", but any time there is a bug that gives us any sort of advantage (unlocks stuff that shouldn't, more xp than intended etc) it's hotfixed within 24 hours........."
"Exactly my point... but fundamentals of the game that contribute to player experience, 1 week..."
"Well so that explains why the knife xp progress was ridiculously low, I bought modern warfare only to grind damascus and I noticed that in almost 5 games I didn't leveled the half of the knife, and now I am stuck in lvl 25, I bought this also bc I knew that the gun xp levels are not as painfully slow as cw but idk men"
Isn�t there an update today
"I just game up on the game, no point in playing it if I can�t level up"
"They added a new mode in warzone and i thought that was a perfect time to unlock some reticles for the cold war weapons.....but noooooo, nothing works"
I�m playing Cold War to finish the battle pass but I�d rather be leveling up my MW weapons
"I'm glad I haven't spent any money on cold war. I do have the game, but I got it from a code I got with a graphics card. Bought the battlepass with points I already had. Zombies is the only redeeming factor"
I was grinding for damascus (i know im late). And i was doing my ars last and i needed just a few more levels. Yurns out warzone still gives XP for some reason amd even better so does plunder. Just hop on there and go for kills
Never too late my friend :)
Reluctantly got on Cold War with a friend only to see weapon xp is working on there. Game is a joke
"Why aren't you guys spamming Infinity Wards twitter handle and Facebook? Publicity is the only way to get them to respond or care.  
Bad publicity always wins."
"Too many people mistakenly tweeting at the Modern Warfare account, they need to go to the Activision support one"
Because it didn't happen in CW
" I just want to play your game like I did before where I could play for hour uninterrupted. I forget what patch it was now becuase I stopped playing for a few months now. But since that one patch the only other thing I have changed is my ram and I constantly get disc read errors.

I remember months back trying to find solutions or any acknowledgement of the issue on your part and found nothing. I've tried all the fixes that have and have not worked for others with the same issue to no avail. 

I just want an answer a proper fix from your end, and not "" Have you tried scan and repair? or have you tried reinstalling? "" YES I have multiple times. And everytime I maybe get a game or 2 in and then insert random disc read error since they always seem to be different. Its bad enough there are dev errors but those I have been able to get under control with fixes from others. 

I just wonder why multiple patches since I played last and I even did a refresh install just last night. How can it be I upgrade my ram from 16 to 32 and it breaks the game lol."
"Look each cod is a yearly release the will leave the game cause the developers have to work on the next game in there cycle happened the last since cod 3 and 4, you lot need to grow up and learn that yeah they don't care about the fame cause the publishers (Activision) are a company and will put pressure on developers to get the next one ready for launch"
Well Activision is killing blizzard and they tried to kill bungie before bungie was like nope I�m out
"I�m not trying to be rude but at this point is it not obvious they�re doing this intentionally? It may be hard to believe because it truly is insanely scummy and corrupt, but just put 2 and 2 together and it�s pretty easy to tell they�re intentionally breaking the game. I really fucking hate it and wish I was wrong, but it�s the truth."
"I honestly wouldn't be surprised. If Ubisoft can give up AAA titles for F2P, doesn't surpise me that they'd fuck us like this to push everyone to Warzone..."
Seriously this is getting fucking annoying. About to go play TitanFall 2 and Battlefront 2 if this bullshit doesn�t get fixed soon
ps4 - no xp and constantly crashing between matches
"Anyone thought about contacting your senator about the shit that this company is pulling? You spend $60 for a game but its not at all what you were promised. Like I shouldn't have to go through 4 screens to get to the part that actually says Modern Warfare. I shouldnt have to be ass blasted with ads for another game before I can even load up into a match. I shouldn't  have to be able to unlock content for a different game in which I do not want to purchase. I love this game. I want to be able to call this game Modern Warfare when I boot up the game. But with whats going on currently, it's  really hard to do that.

I understand that a company can do whatever they want with their games. When a company promises a customer a product and it isn't what it is advertised, shame on them. BUT, when the customer spends THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY, thats a whole different level of shade and no one deserves that. You paid for Modern Warfare, not some bloatware thats plastered with ads and content for another game."
I�m convinced they�re breaking it on purpose to get people to move to black ops
Brooo I thought it was only me!!!! Wasted a double weapon XP for 1 hour fml
F bro
Most of the games menus remind me of a casino now. When I first boot the game it hangs and will only let me load into Warzone. Theres tons of flashing icons for new stuff and the store says it has some free stuff. Only I check and nothings free. Cold war says its on sale until you go to buy it. Looks like they have it 15$ off now again finally. I get it.. I paid 80$ for a game that I never played the campaign of. I just wanted to play some multiplayer like the old days. All the hours of changing pc settings to try and get this game to run without crashing... all the cool items.. I will say I had tons of fun playing realism moshpit.
"They don't care. They push MW off to the side and try to make it worse so by the time people decide to try Cold War, it's gonna be the worst option. It's only to force people to stop playing MW and move to CW. It's only about money to them. They don't actually care if we have fun and enjoy their game. Why would they?"
"I'm not sure if this was posted in here, and I'm not reading through 200+ comments, but like many of you, I'm not getting weapon XP on Xbox. What I do notice though, and what really bothers me, is that I get not only camo XP/unlocks (which I don't give a fuck about), but also unlocks for Cold War, A GAME I DON'T OWN. 

The only conclusion I can draw from this is that this is on purpose. It is not a bug, they're doing it intentionally to entice more people into buying COD: Cold War."
"I wasn�t planning on buying Cold War, but if this is their strategy then there is no chance I�m buying it."
"Wait, they removed weapon progression from MW?"
Welcome bro :)
I just wanna level up my guns man! It�s the only reason I�ve been putting up with this dumpster trash
"I started my camo grind late, but I�m so close to Damascus. No weapon xp has been a real kick in the balls"
Because Infinity Ward do not give a f\*ck about MW anymore.
"What pisses me off ...
I paid for battle pass and cant use any of the guns in modern warfare call of duty .  AND NOW A WEEK WITH NO XP !!!!!!! We all pay alot of money to play this ......"
They arent working on MW anymore. Its sad.
"Activision is the most shittiest company there is, like wtf are we supposed to do without leveling up our guns."
"When are they gonna fix the fuckin issue, fuckin seaon ends in a few days, i bought thr battle pass and im 7 tiers from 100, and im close to master prestige, but noooooooo, they'd rather add a fuckin Fortnite ripoff called Warzone Rumble than fix the ongoing bugs smh"
I have only launchers left for camos. I was wondering why it was going so fucking slow.
Does anyone else have the Green square notifications on multiple menus and have no way to get rid of them? I�ve had like one added each of the past 4 weeks and I can�t get rid of those fuckers
"Check down the bottom of your screen, there is usually an option to clear those (L3 on PS4)"
Wait. You can't level weapons and unlock attachments?
Im dealing with the same issue. No kill multipliers which isnt necessary but without them it makes the game look ugly and my SPR is still on LVL 1. I expected better from infinity ward.
"They purposefully crippled the game to get people to buy Cold War. Something else to keep in mind: Activision is a shitty company for what they�re doing, but don�t think every other video game maker isn�t watching this as well. If crippling a game causes people to buy the new version, every single game studio is going to follow their lead. This transcends way beyond Activision and Call of Duty."
"I honestly think its a ploy to get people to buy black ops.  Get people frustrated with MW and they buy Black Ops so they can make progress in something.

Its very true they dont care."
I know this thread is about weapon xp but Is anyone else having issues ranking up too? I have not been able to progress through the ranks for quite some time now even when I use my xp tokens. I've had no luck with Activision support.
"So I read a lot of the comments but this kinda stopped us from completing mastery camos if we can�t even level our guns up to max in a week,yea?"
"Bought the game like 2 days ago during the discount and it seemed weird that my weapons were not leveling at all, stupid me decided to check reddit after a few hours of playing and now I find this, Im really pissed. And this is not the only thing that it's broken, also the missions for the operators are not progressing and all the easter egg related weapon blueprints in warzone are bugged/unobtainable. This is a fucking mess"
"Not only weapon xp, but I�m not getting any match xp at all over the week and a half. I�ve had a ton of time off work due to inclement weather that I�ve missed out on 80ish levels or so. I want hour of double xp tokens for every 25,000 xp I�ve missed out on."
"Because of the 2xp in cold war I'm planning on going there this weekend and trying to grind out some zombies with a friend, but, before I get screamed at, the only time I ever play cold war multiplayer is with friends bcs it's dogshite, after that idrk what I'm gonna do if this xp glitch isnt fixed, I hit 26 gold camos last night so I'm 2/3 the way to damascus but none of my other guns are max level so I cant get it done now because without normal xp rates its gonna take years to level my guns up
I'm 100% not switching to playing Cold war full time tho, while the campaign and zombies are fun from what I've played, and raid crossroads express and nuke town are fun, the rest of multiplayer is garbage, the movement is sluggish compared to modern warfare, the guns look poorly designed compared to modern warfare, diamond camo looks shit, gold looks like they just used a fill tool on the gun, dmu and dark rather look cool, I will give them that.
Overall I wouldnt recommend switching to cold war unless you would consistently play with friends there but its fucking awful that theyd stop weapon progression in modern warfare to push us to cold war

Shitting on one game so its unplayable isnt how you get players to move to another, if players are staying on one game and not moving on theres clearly an issue with the new one, and it's that that needs to be addressed, not how good the one before it was"
"yeah, just got this problem too."
Congratulations mate you do a great job

"Plunder, Supply Runs, Double Weapon XP tokens

EDIT: as in play plunder and do supply runs with double weapon xp enabled. Make sure the right gun is equipped."
I used a double weapon xp tokens twice and only got 30 xp from a match
I read in a different thread that CO-OP isn't broken.
Coop isnt very good for leveling up guns so it isn�t really considered for gun leveling.
Interesting that completing the daily challenges does give you points.
"~~What�s the issue?~~
Edit: Sorry misread. Yeah I�ve heard a few people having this issue. Activision suggest to clear the cache on your console. 

https://support.activision.com/uk/en/articles/deleting-old-files-from-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-consoles"
"The game isn�t recognizing that I have modern warfare installed, thus its asking me to purchase the game"
Just gave it a shot to no avail.
"Hey, it's broken I think and you have to launch Modern Warfare seperately, not via Cold War."
"The problem there is that I don�t own cold war to begin with, only MW"
Did anyone get a dev error code 6063 when launching mw?
Do you get any errors? Make sure you have all the packs downloaded. There's like 8 packs and I think you need most of them to play multiplayer. You're better off downloading them all to make sure that's not the issue.
"I�m on PlayStation, was able to fix by updating licenses in settings, not sure if that�s possible on Xbox"
"I can't relate because I've had all MW and most CW weapons maxed, but I will say that these past few weeks have been bizarre as hell.

How could ***one*** ***update*** result in reticles being broken, loadout glitches returning, the PC ""gun-garbage"" graphical bug returning, interface highlighting issues, latency and ping drags, Bunker 11 being broken for some, player API's being hidden, Easter Egg blueprints not functioning, COD point issues, weapon XP glitches, invisibility glitches in Armoured Royale...

I'll stop here, and I understand game coding is very delicate - one fuck up and it can mess with many other assets, but good lord where is a Triple-A development company when you need one?"
Another big deal is that hitmarkers sometimes dont show up especially when you stun or flash someone.
Why hasn't the game been pulled from the store like cyberpunk 2077 ? This game is literally unplayable since the latest update going on a week. Doesn't patches need to be certified by sony and microsoft before released ?
"There is a big difference between cod and cyberpunk. Cyberpunk had refunds available the moment it released but up until now modern warfare and warzone have been perfect. Technically since the game is more than 1 year old there is no such thing as refund, kind of like how you can�t return something after 30 days. I think all these bugs are coming from activision�s greed. They want to promote cold war do they made sure modern warfare wasn�t fun. And like how u/BrandenRowe said in his comment, �the game�s coding is very delicate,� so by trying to mess the game up a tiny bit, they probably messed up more to the point where even cold war is affected."
Unplayable? Lmao.
It has nothing to do with them trying to push people into purchasing Cold War. They love making money off of older titles. Take off your tinfoil hat.
Nope it�s only on that one blueprint
That�s so stupid can I at least move the carry handle over or is that locked too
"You can. Idk if the carry handle is a attachment or not (i dont use the m4), but if it is all you have to do is unlock that attachment. You have to have the 1776 as your base blueprint then once you unlock the carry handle, you can use the frankenstein to put you old faithful attachments on the 1776. Unfortunately thats the only way."
The carry handle is not an attachment. How can I put it on then

this is like day 6 or 7 dude
"Exactly. We're at 7 days and counting with nothing but ""looking into it"". I'm just gonna try to get a refund. It's been broken since I purchased on Friday."
"JESUS  
yeah this aint an accident   
that stuff theyre trying to pull on us is intentional"
More like day 100 or so. MW feels like a dlc for Cold Warzone
"I don�t even care about the xp because I have all my guns maxed out but like, I swear I�ve been lagging way more than normal. My shots also aren�t hitting as often even when I�m dead center on someone standing still. This game just seems ridiculously broken right now and I wish it wasn�t."
This right here. Glad to hear I�m not the only one.
"I know the update comes out today, right? If they haven�t fixed, I�m actually gonna uninstall my game"
Is there actually another (download) update confirmed for today? I'm really hoping we can just finally get any of the new weapons.
RPG stands for role playing game.. I think you meant progression
"yes i did, thanks"
Rocket propelled grenade
"Mine are still leveling up just really really slowly, Ive managed to scrape 5 levels out of around 8ish hours of playtime this week. I hope its just a difficult to fix bug and iw are working on it, otherwise I dread to think everyones response to activision if it isnt, Im guessing everyone will go off to other games but I dont really know of any other major fps' on at the minute. Halo infinite is gonna be released later this year but thats really all I know about fps' so Im not really sure where I would turn for my next pvp game. At the request of my friend I bought CW, I got it off CDkeys so it was like �10 cheaper but it still wasnt really worth it, theres like 4 good multiplayer maps, the guns look badly designed compared to MW, the movement mechanics are nowhere near as smooth and the camo challenges are just as stupid, the only good thing about it is the campaign and zombies really, multiplayer and rebirth warzone are just dogshit tbh"
"i wouldnt have caved in and gave them more money, just hold out until the next BF game dude"
"My weapons don�t level up at all !!!
No matter how many kill i get!!"
Exactly. Weapon XP stuck since yesterday
I got like 50 kills in 2 games and my sp-r exp didnt make a single change
I�ve been leveling my guns in plunder
"bro i got quickscoped

me: by what? SPR? AX50? kar? HDR?

no. by an UZI"
what wasn't? someone explain I am dumb
"I headshotted the guy with one bullet and killed him, but all I did was aim and fired. It was a complete accident"
Fuck that fire shotgun
"I know, but it's fun to use at times haha"
What's the uzi load out?
action express rounds
"Monolithic suppressor, G.I. mini, .41 AE 32 round mag, FSS carbine pro, and the stippled grip tape"
"Mono, carbine pro, gi mini reflex, thats all I can see"
Why's everybody got an obsidian Uzi these days I see them everywhere in SnD.
when your inner aimbot reaction pops
Haha yes!
"Come on man, what is that shotgun"
"Jak-12, I think..."
Man I think I need to add fire to my shotgun that already shoots fast as hell
seems like it is
i don't even know what you mean tbh
if you use that shotgun ill fart on your dads balls
"I feel like they messed with it a little. In warzone I feel like it's a bit off. In CW it was as if I was fighting the assist and causing me to miss my shots, now it's happening in warzone since the 11gig ps4 update."
"Yeah, I think CW feels that way too..."
That�s been happening to me a lot. Even when my crosshair is just barely off of the target there is no aim assist to help me with that 0.0001 mm of distance. Also if anyone here also has cold war can you tell me if it�s the same there cuz I wouldn�t be surprised if this was another activision ploy to get people to buy cold war.
Cold war maybe a bit of no aim assist too... It's like the patterns the same.
"Yes definitely, for me it's toggled between sessions. I can easily demonstrate I am getting 0 aim assist by moving my aim over a target which when not working (about 75% of the time estimated) there is no slow down at all. Basically makes the game unplayable in the lobbies I get put in."
Yeah yeah yeah! That's exactly the way I feel! It felt like someone just mess with you by toggling your aim assist (not literally but you get the point).
Since last update aim assist has damn well been non existent.
Yea also feel the same
Can you describe your point of view? Just curious you know
Its bugged after the new update
"Bug... Well damn, what does it actually do to the aim assist? Does it do like what I stated?"
"Aim assist seems ok to me, probably cause I occasionally practice without but something else is bugging me. It feels like the game is zooming in and out randomly or something.. just feels off, I don't know how to explain it. Made me feel sick so I had to stop playing."
My aim assist feels like it's toggling on and off during games. Test it on custom games and it does for some bs reasons.
"Me and a friend brought Cold War last night, we are both pretty good at MW and couldn�t believe how bad the aim assist was on Cold War. Felt so inconsistent like sometimes I�d smoke people and other times I�d barely hit a shot and then get killed by them. We weren�t sure if it was just us struggling with the new game mechanics but I definitely think something is off with aim assist on this game (can�t say how MW feels because I haven�t played it in a couple days)"
If you're on base consoles like PS4 and XBox1 then it explains alot cause the animation is sometimes clunky.
Yup. Something feels off. I've gone from snapping on to peoples to missing easy shots now.
it never snapped. never
"Don't think so, but my aim is shit at the best of times anyway, so I wouldn't notice. I have been dragged off target by another player a few times though, so I think it still works"
I guess a few have some problems and I'm one of the few. But it does feel annoying when the aim assist drags you off a target you're aiming at.
"Nope, feels the same as always"
"Seems like only a few or some were affected I guess. Like that bug where you can't access the operator menu, I can access that while others can't."
Aim assist shouldn�t exist in a cross play game
"Then don't play crossplay. Aim assist is needed no matter what, especially for controller players. If controller players don't have at least some aim assist, how the hell are they gonna be on some par with those whose aim are more superior like those on mouse and keyboard."
"I remember this happened months ago where we heard their mics in game, not just between rounds."
What the hell?
I literally call them out instead of typing it out so no
"Yeah I�ve experienced being able to see the other team chatting. It happened before the new update though for me. Maybe like a week or so before the new update came out, and it was only 1 game so far that it happened."
This has been a thing for months lol
">I�ve read through a ton of articles about modern warfare and other stuff online, but I can�t figure out if I�m having this issue by myself.

Evidently you didn�t read enough because this subreddit has been posting that same issue the past few days since the update dropped."
"�Tons of articles� 

I�m sorting by new and 9/10 posts are about weapon XP, like what articles has he been reading haha."
"Sometimes throw two bettys to overcome any opposition perks, but this time it couldn't have worked better. Many thanks to 'Mr Navigator' for the commentary /  ego massaging..."
You would've lost if it wasn't hardcore lol
*Obligatory turn off motion blur comment*
watching this makes me want to put bleach in my eyes
Test
"So far this game has been pretty bad since buying it yesterday, no xp bug, graphics bug, cheaters in 5th of my lobbies, is anyone else having these issues? I can see others having the no xp bug but what about the others."
Thank god I haven�t bought CW. This company doesn�t deserve a respect. I�m just waiting for the next Battlefield installment and I will hop back to Battlefield franchise
"....have you seen how battlefield has been doing? 4 and 5 took months after release before they were in a decent position to be called a good game. Even then, the developers kept fucking with battlefield 5 to make their game worse and then remove the updates they implemented further pissing off the fan base.

I cannot imagine battlefield 6 will be any better than what you are seeing right now. If battlefield 5 is an example of what it to come then battlefield 6 will be shit at launch and take months for the support to bring it up to a playable level."
Same here. Hopefully battlefield 6 yanks a shit ton of disgruntled players from cod to bf to hurt Activision's revenue
"Same, my friend asked me if he should buy either mw or cw and I said ""man, mw was the best CoD for me but the devs killed it in less than a year... they will do the same with CW, I would save my money if I was you and wait till the next Battlefield or something"" and he agreed."
"They are still charging $60 for this game, with a core component of the game (progression) almost entirely non-functional. I just purchased this game on Friday last week. I feel ripped off."
You were riped off. 100%. This game is not functional right now. Especially as a player with lvl 1 guns.
As you should. I spent $90 on CW and feel like it was such a waste. Now I just buy operator packs on MW because I�m bored. Of course they don�t release anything fun and new for MW. Even though so many people still play.
"Sorry to say this but.. What? For the past decade and a half every cod title lost support as soon as the next one came out. So why are the fans uproaring about this now? Because of the fact that CW turned out as bad as it did so everyone is stuck on last year's cod?   


 Trust me, I'm right there with you but this dropped support after a year shit has been happening literally every single year. So why and how are we surprised by this only now?   


 But good news: CW sold like ass compared to last years MW so now they're (Allegedly) Breaking last years game to force everyone to the current shitty one that everyone is trying to avoid to begin with... Apparently that's what voting with your wallet has done up to this point.   


 Everything about this sucks."
Progression still works in Battlefield Bad Company 2 today.
">  they're (Allegedly) Breaking last years game 
 
I'm getting annoyed by people saying that they're trying to break the game with every new update. This game has had some of the most broken and gamebreaking updates I've ever seen in my life. You can put the tin foil hat on and claim that it's a conspiracy but every update for this game has created more issues than it has solved. 
 
This isn't the first time they're throwing a cod game away for the next one and it won't be the last. People gotta stop having faith with a company that doesn't care about them. It's a yearly series they don't care about this game anymore. Cod 2021 is being made right now."
"I'd imagine it's because the rest of the industry is running on a live service model where one game is supported for years with new content. And here we are with the best Call of Duty platform the franchise has had in *years*, and instead of recieving that live service treatment, it's been ditched for the next (not so great) game.

It shouldn't come as a surprise to literally anyone that support for a CoD game was dropped after the next yearly installment, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still upset people who have gotten accustomed to that live service model of buying a game once and having it supported for years.

And the one part that *is* getting that live service treatment is F2P Warzone, and not the game we all spent $60 on."
"I�m glad someone said it.... people act like this is some new heinous crime. Literally 90% of all games released lose support when sequels/next installments come out. IW is busy making MW2 or some shit, the game had its run but a new dancer has taken the stage and Activision wants her to shine. Posts like OP�s really just come off as whiny, bitchy tantrums."
That�s not true at all. Most cod titles are supported for a long while after the next game released. Activision just decided to throw this game to the dirt
Would be great if they ditched the yearly release cycle and actually stick to a game for more than a year. But we know that�ll never happen because money.
So lets make them lose money. I skipped CW entirely and dropped warzone (daily player and not free to play either) as well
"At least release a new game once every 2 years so they get more development time, and the players get to enjoy the game longer"
"You know, there's a problem, and it is that they own the market. Yeah, there are more ""shooters"" but any has the same ""qualities"" and characteristics from Call of Duties, so they can pretty much do w/e they want they will still sell as much as they want"
"And if everyone but 10 year olds who don't have the money to buy cosmetics like most people do only buy it,  then they would be forced to either listen to the actual community for once, or get screwed and stuck with little kids and move over for a shooter game that actually cares about their fans"
I want people to remember the fact they tanked this game into the ground on purpose!
"I can't wait to build my PC and then buy Halo Master Chief collection. I will gladly leave this BS CoD world, to re-immerse myself back into the wonderful world of online Halo."
"If you build a PC a whole new world of shooters awaits you.  Tarkov, Rising Storm 2, Squad, Post Scriptum, Hell Let Loose, Insurgency.  Ascend to Godhood brethren!"
So I bought the game at the beginning of the year cause Apex was pissing me off. Little did I know I was going towards a game with even less interest from the devs. The worst part is that I now hate myself for not playing MW at its peak. This game even now shows a lot of potential but all the devs want is to push the next game. Why can't we have nice things? -_-
I too can't believe the thing that happens every year happened this year.
"This. I can't believe that a new one of these posts get thrown up here what seems like every day. 

It. Happens. Every. Year. They want you to buy the new game. CW sucks but I didn't enjoy MW19 either. 95% of the sub, me included, wanted Shoot the ship and hated most of the other maps, the doors every 2 feet, and the campy mounting."
The NEXT Call of Duty?? They already went radio silent with the current CoD (CW)!
"Wasnt it like that since a decade?

Anyway glad people notice."
"Same here. I used to play MW religiously, dropped COD completely once CW came out (played the beta and could immediately tell it was a downgrade) and everything I loved about the game shifted to push CW content. 

I'm done with predatory games. If you won't support your game, I won't play it."
"First off, a lot of these heinous decisions are coming from Activision, not necessarily directly from Infinity Ward. I'm definitely going back to never touching Treyarch games again, but you better believe I'm voting with my wallet, and will be purchasing the next Modern Warfare installment, because I want to support good games. Despite the big downturn recently, the game is still superior to Cold War, and I want games like Modern Warfare to keep being made. Why pass on the next GOOD game, because the game prior (Cold War) sucked? Unless you're trying to stick it to Activision, in which case I get it."
It's the last for me too for the same reason.
"bf6 is coming out this year, ill make sure to not play the new cod"
I'm just going to go back to Titanfall 2 because its wayyyy better especially at this point in time.
Dude this is literally the exact same routine every year with every COD and it will continue to happen
"This is beyond absurdity to leave a broken game for a week when they could�ve just reverted the bug. Its a game from last year, people are still buying it, if this is not a blatant fuck you to the loyal gamers I don�t know what is. I�m honestly done with this franchise and i hope all of you follow up on you word to quit buying future cods. Reddit might be a small group of their sales but its the most vocal. Boycott future cods!!"
Yup! The new battlefield can�t get here sooner. The way activision abandoned their best game so far for a shitty one with worse graphics for next gen makes no sense.
Just stop playing ma dudes
They just removed the post. Shame.
"Are you new?  This has happened every year.  Why the fuck would it be different now?  

Guess what?  It's going to happen next year too.  And the year after that.  

Stop whinging."
"This happens basically every year, It's nothing new."
" Please, add Special Operations to Private Match Modes so players can play by themselves. And allow fast revives on Classic Special Ops. Also, did you know that when a player died right before the last enemy was killed in Survival Mode, that dead player would get stuck in Spectating Mode? (At least that happened to me, I don't know if it still does since these last few large updates)."
not sure. the que times are slow and the lobby i played in was pretty empty
"I�m sure, just tried in the dead of morning and got 2 separate dead queues with different people. Of course the realism on the front page is the night only mode."
"Yeah, because very few people like it"
"In general: yes, it's a fantastic game and imo the best COD multiplayer they've ever made. The gun customisation, map variety, modes etc are all really great. The campaign is very fun and immersive too. It isn't as good as the original COD4 campaign but it's still very good and worth playing 

But today: no. A recent update broke weapon XP so you can't level up guns. Absolutely dont buy until they fix it (hopefully very soon)"
"Whatever your smoking, let me have some. Because whatever makes you believe Modern Warfare is a good game is something very very controlling."
"No don�t do that , there will be a new cod at the end of the year , the same thing that is happening to mw right will happen to cold war later , just wait for the new game!!!"
"Hell no. Progression is non-functional in the game for 7 days. And the only communication we've received is ""Studio is looking into it"" and ""Stay tuned for more information."" This could mean anything. Its entirely possible this doesn't get fixed for a very long time, if at all.

Do not make the same mistake I did on Friday."
No
Yeah buy it but not until they fix the XP. Right now you can't level up guns because they want us to buy cold war.
"Unless you're REALLY into the campaign, don't purchase until the XP bug is fixed. You'll be stuck with default loadouts and no attachments. That aside, I bought it a month and a half ago and have no regrets. Insanely fun game."
Yes it is worth it. MP is still going strong. Seems lots of people came back from CW or never left to play.
Multiplayer is going strong. Are you good bro?
Not right now. It's bugged all to shit.
i can't even open the app for some reason. gotta wait for another 250gb update or something
it definitely is.
1000% - MP lobbies are still packed and WZ the same
"The game in general is very good. The campaign is great all around, and the multiplayer is also good. The only downside is the weapons glitch that fucked up weapon xp (that you probably already know based off of the other comments)."
"Sure it's worth
But we have a little bugs now so wait for about less than a week"
"Don't get me wrong It's easily the best cod in a long time, but the way it's been handled since CW was released has been terrible.

If your going to get it I'd say buy it second hand so Activision don't profit from a new copy / digital sale."
"I would say yes, but there�s currently a major game breaking bug where you can�t earn XP in multiplayer, so no level up progression or new unlocks. If that gets fixed then yeah, it�s worth picking up but it�s been broken for a week now and the devs can�t be arsed to do anything about it."
"If you see it on sale for $20 then grab it, but be warned that the only good maps are only playable regularly maybe 6months out of the 12. The warfare mode feels like bf4 but made by wish.com and 90% of the maps are pure dog shit. That aside, the gameplay is good and is nice to have mindless fun on the three decent maps."
No. Shittest fucking game ever made. Wasted my money.
And you�re wasting your time in this sub-Reddit
"The campaign is really good and warzone is ok, if your a new player u will probably enjoy the multiplayer i fucking hated it, its basically designed for new players to the franchise so u might like it"
"in what way is MW designed for new players? its the most brutal and unforgiving cod we've had in years, this isnt a black ops game with its zero recoil and forgiving kill times"
r/copypasta
This is the kind of shit posting we really do need rn
Open nat lmao
My name is Donald J Biden and i support this post.
Don�t worry man just get gud
Kek
How bout gun xp
Oooh your funny
"I mean, if I cant level up my guns it doesnt matter what playlist they go with, cuz I wont play"
Can we just have permanent rusty boat ship?
We all want that to happen but we all know it�s not gonna be permanent
I've noticed they're bringing operator skin packs from season 1 back in rotation. So that's cool at least
11 gigs for bugs?
Shoot the ship
"I say hot garbage, but I hope it�s something fun."
What time is it usually?
1-2
1-2
Wasn�t there an update only a couple of days ago? Won�t it be like another month until another drops?
"No, it�s the game mode update every Thursday"
Gunfight osp
"Such an underrated mode. I love how because nobody has guns, you can move a little more freely in the first few seconds. Gulag shower is actually kinda playable"
Rusty ship. Shoot house isn�t that good
It�s good for long shots
This is a post for r/CODwarzone. ;)
Maybe youre right. But im asking here because i have MW so maybe someone like me had the issue so he could help too.
Yeah youre right i posted their now.
try an older gpu driver version with a custom install. Custom install will wipe out the other driver you have before installing the new one
"I tried that bud.   
I think its actually this shit new ISP im with since moving into my new place. It works perfectly fine no issues from 10pm - 3am when I went to bed.   
When I get up and play during the day its trash.   
Will try changing ISPs."
I just changed ISPs and this issue is no longer present. I was browsing more forums in Australia and found most people with the same issue were with TPG or subsidiary ISP's of the same company.I changed to Aussie Broadband who are the only ISP in australia that publicly release their CVC graphs. [https://www.aussiebroadband.com.au/cvc-graphs/](https://www.aussiebroadband.com.au/cvc-graphs/) Basically my ISP was not paying enough for bandwidth prioritization over other ISPs.Warzone works perfectly now.
"Its a bug, the last patch bugged a lot. Hit markers, weapon xp etc"
it's not a hidden change...it's a bug
Oh well whoops on their part
The slippery clutch AUG has some changes the 1776 M4 changes to a purple and a dark red on the mag but those are all I can think of rn
Nice one!
The malphas asval has the red stripes with obsidian it looks kind of cool
That's neat!
"I put the gold camo on the orange �pumpkin punisher�grau and it looks pretty good because it overrides the orange - maybe that one will look decent with obsidian also

Basically any (legendary/rare ?) weapon from the battle passes that has a own special pattern or predefined Color will add 

F.e. Chupacabra m91 may add a red hue"
"The Kilo141 from ""Anime Super Pink tracer bundle.""
I cant remember the mp7 and Famas had ut too or not, but im sure about kilo."
I don't understand why it works for some weapons of a certain theme and not others. Shame all these bright blueprints dont have an effect on obsidian
"They are making purchasable packs that give access to these characters so that�s how you�ll be able to progress them.

Only if you buy the pack. It�s basically a visual glitch that shows the missions unlocked. Has happened with other operators in the past too."
[deleted]
"It's the same for Wyatt & Minotaur (their original operator missions). I started back on MW around Season 5, so I missed these. Are they going to allow progression on these again?"
"I�m not sure, it wasn�t there before for me, even though i played during the season mara was released, i never got her though."
"no,they will try to sell you this [skins](https://cod.tracker.gg/warzone/db/bundles/400299-battle-pass-season-1-pack) from past seasons"
Pretty sure you have always been able to make progression as long as you got the operator during that season. Have done it with a few different operators.
I had the battle pass for s1 but never reached teir 100 it's a glitch
I want to unlock this skin and have completed this objective couple if times now but see no progress. Should i keep trying or there will be no progress on this skin?
I actually want the desert variant :(
"Was just about to ask the same thing. Missions don�t track, hope it�s just a glitch and we�ll actually be able to unlock the skins by completing challenges rather than having to buy them."
"So does anyone actually KNOW what is going on, or are you all speculating?! There's a major difference."
"Funny is that people  can't even activate 2FA, because it doesn't work....this company is a joke."
"100%, no point in boasting about banning however many hundred thousand accounts for hacking when a lot of them are innocent and were just hacked themselves."
"I�m really sorry to hear about this, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you have next to no chance of getting a positive outcome. This exact thing has happened to me recently. 

I had my account hacked on 14/01/21, the service I received was absolutely dreadful from start to finish. False promises and failed expectations. 

There is no support. Emails are cookie-cutter and no-reply addresses. Live chat is completely pointless, takes hours to connect and then they cannot help you in any way but just tell you to wait.

I finally got my account back on 03/02/21 at 17:31, i logged in and was changing classes and at 17:36 I was kicked out and permanently banned. I�m an xbox player, never even played on pc let alone cheated!

I still don�t have my account back, i�m currently levelling guns on my third account (second account gets deleted for first account recovery).

Activision�s customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. If there was a regulatory body above them i�d have reported it by now. As would many others.

It may be best for to accept that your account is gone, and to start fresh. And if by some miracle Activision support do their job and get it back to you without banning it, then you can be extremely pleased."
"I was already thinking this but it gives me some closure on it knowing the same thing has happened with you. 

I can accept an account loss but it�s the fact that all the money I�ve spent on the game was for nothing because I now don�t have access to those bundles, I�d happily take reinstated purchases and possibly battle pass earnings but I highly doubt it will happen."
"I bought the bundle and the missions are working, so it�s probably what the people above are saying"
Yes this is because I don't own any of these bundles or haven't reach the season pass level for the mission. Anyways like I've said below they should make it more clear what you need to own in order to be able to do the  mission or just don't display the mission on screen. Or someone else said it's just a bug also
[deleted]
"I don't see these requirements mentioned anywhere above or under my missions, the missions aren't locked I can do them apparently. If what you say is right then why is the game even showing me the missions on my list in the first place ?"
I just wish there was something that states what we need
I never played season one but there are operator missions for Mara that appear for some reason
"specs:

intel 17 8700

gtx 1660 super

24 gb corsair ddr4"
Why is this NSFW ?
Cause of the way they fucked those people lol
"Each one after the first thought "" he got that guy but he won't get me!"" Then aw fuck realization"
"there are people from all over in lobbies, I think you will be fine dude"
That's a relief thanks brother!
"I live in mumbai and have a great connection. Ping for me is usually less than 40 and I only really have minor rendering issues when dropping in in warzone, which I rarely play, so yeah it'll be fine."
Thanks for help dude !
You need to launch modern warfare from its own game not Cold War
"Yep.   For me on pc if I just played cold war and want to go to mw i have to close the whole game and open mw seperately otherwise it does not want to open.    
I used to be able to cross launch but after the update it just doesn't want me to. Happens both ways"
Quit the game and start it again
"Yeah bro I got the same issue 
After  update me and my friend tried to play online  multiplayer with one ps4 but when the map loaded game just crashed"
Okay well at least it isn't just me. This is honestly just getting ridiculous with these bugs
"Hey man. Yeah I am having the same issue just as of the last couple days. In multiplayer and warzone. Its performing fine stable over 80-100fps on ultra then I get a random lag spike for 500-999 ping.   
I've ran performance stress tests for CPU, Memory, GPU, SSD, PSU. No issues.   
I have no issues on any other games.   


I am getting 1-2 second freezes in game and recovers. Once recovered my character is 5-10 metres away."
"Wow, that's just absurd. I have no idea how they borked a game so hard so quickly"
THE TIMING
Hello there!
"no weapon xp means the tryhards are gone and mostly just the people who enjoy the game for fun are who are playing  
(not all but a decent amount)"
Apex s8
Time to learn the apex seasons
"I only play HC (Kill Confirmed and TDM, no DOM since next to nobody is playing the objective). Using the Kar98 in HC is really rewarding and a great experience. But if you hit a lobby filled with MP5 and AS-VAL users... well, yeah, it may ruin even the best mood ;))"
i feel the same way most days - have some silver...

"People never check the killcam before yelling �cheats�. It�s sad. I get called out all the time for knowing where someone is hiding *when we have a UAV*. Like, dude, you�re a red blip on the map. Duh."
am i the only one who cant play with this ? it triggerd the fuck out of me more then helping me
"Usually just makes me panic, shit myself and run to cover. Because of hardcore, if someone is looking at me I dont really have the option to turn, locate them, aim and shoot them. Usually it's good for telling me I'm surrounded or being snuck up on. It's nice for keeping a specialist streak alive on HQ when you're the last guy."

Never ever play with high alert on Shipment
Same here...when I use specialist I almost always die after I achieved it (which is when I got high alert) but I often get 8+ kills when using normal streaks
Yeah. It�s weird
which skin you get by this mission ?
They appear based on some kind of bug.
 Same thing happening to me
It's a visual glitch your not supposed to see the OP Challenges
It is the same for mara when you dont have the teir 100 s1 battle pass
"Nothing is random. We're talking about a multi billion dollar company.

We got Shoot the Ship for like two weeks after a 1,5 month period of pure garbage (with the CW release). 

They added it again prior to their investor call to probably show the user engagement etc. 

With this whole XP mess they could do us a favour and make up for it by adding it again, I just don't see it coming tbh. 

The update is today. Let's wait.

10 bucks on a juicy Grazna Raid 24/7"
1v1 gunfight on aniyah platypus
Fuck it they should just give us shoot house and shipment separately forever as a way of saying sorry and actually fix this problem.
Seemingly random. I assume you mean shoot the ship? We just recently got it and it cycled out again. Prior to that we didn�t have it for a while. So I suspect it won�t be back for a while
"There is nothing random as if you didn't notice, since the Cold War release MW playlist updates are pure garbage...  
So I assume that the fav players playlist will not come back for a long long time."
"Dude...

Dont waste your time...

Go play a better game..."
Let him play what tf he wants.
Get a nuke in a normal mode
"Infected is a normal mode, it's survival bro."
"Getting a nuke in infected is the same as getting a nuke against bots, doesn't mean anything."
"Actually no, it's harder cus you have a random gun setup and the reinfected throw down tacs to keep respawning, if you've ever played, you'd know"
"I feel the same away about Cold War, COD just isn�t scratching the itch it used to. It goes to show that the only product Activision cares about right now is Warzone and not the actual streamlined games they sell for 80 dollars. 

Honestly, I hope to god that DICE releases a good Battlefield game so I can ditch this shit."
"Have you tried swapping the modes you play and the weapons/perks you use? You know, to freshen shit up. Also, it's fine to just stop playing once you no longer feel like playing. This isn't a job, you don't have to force yourself to play."
"Get into Reinfected Ground War while you can, I'm like you, basically all I play is regular infected and Reinfected GW is so fun I'd gladly take it as a replacement for the regular infected mode."
If it wasn't just 3 maps and kept timing out 50% of the time it'd be fun.
"Yeah i had that issue also, someone posted saying its bugged but they found you can level them up in plunder."
"Get that PKM levelled up my man, it�s like the kilo if the kilo was loaded with stopping power rounds"

Nah
My guns are not getting xp anymore either. Not sure what is happening.
"Same here. First most of them went away (As was the experience for most MW players too i'm pretty sure), and over the past week or two i've noticed they're all gone now.

I've also noticed that I can't even view completionist camos for MW guns anymore unless i've got them unlocked. This probably dates back to CW integration tho."
"I'm not one to criticise developers, but this issue should have been rectified within 24 hours. Ridiculous."
Hope I get my weapons double xp back
This problem has been in the game since last Thurday's update and Activision's Twitter says they're looking into it. There's been a shit ton of posts about this issue over the past week. You're not the only one.
"I just jumped on after like half a year away, great way to start things I guess"
My guns aren't leveling up either. No clue what is going on.
"It�s only happening with multiplayer too, I get gun levels in warzone but not not multiplayer."

Go offline and check downloads. The ones youre missing will show up
"Can confirm. Disconnect your console from the net, open the game and click on local co-op. It�ll start the download right away."
I'm not missing anything
Yeah same here with me. I've been lazy and haven't looked into it that much. Keep me posted!
"Same here, downloaded and installed all the data packages and still �Installation suspended�. Same for Survival."
"And that's the reason that I'm trying to do it, I've unlocked the sykov before it has been completely released so I just wanted to try it out in survival but I can't."
"i have the same issue, been trying to find how to solve it but nothing has come up, also in some �fixes� i�ve seen, there are like 2-3 more downloads (spec ops packs) that are missing from my available download list"
Survival (co op) you can buy it from the weapon shop in the match
The new pistol got seen in Warzone today. Idk how. But I hope it will be in S2 finally.
"I basically only play gunfights as a solo player, and i don't mind it. I dont mind a  2v1 its good practice. But yeah having teamamates leave is always awful."
Yeah exactly!
"I don�t play in party�s sometimes when I do gunfight, I don�t think that should be a requirement"

Did you read the subreddit. This has been an issue for since the last major update.
"Scanned through the top post but didn�t go too deep. Don�t have time to read everything, thanks though."
So probably they are doing it in purpose

I used to have this problem on my grau in multiplayer but yesterday it started leveling up but not much
"It levels up, but so slow that�s it�s not even worth it, I even used double weapon xp, do you know if it�s different for wz?"
Good game shit devs
"Yup that�s exactly it. It�s crazy how unoptimized Cold War is, random issues here and there, and I imagine this game was like this at laucnh"
"It�s not the devs. It�s the publisher. IW has so much in store for COD19 , they added three guns and tons of new skins about 50-60 days ago. They keep at it. But Activision doesn�t want people to play this game. Old users are worthless to shareholder reports. You want �new� players on the new game. That�s why they are crippling this one, because it�s so fucking good"
"I mean it's Activision, not Infinity Ward who made the game.


Edit: for those who don't understand Infinity Ward made the game, but Activision makes some of the big desicions"
Would you recommend buying it now? I've been saving for a while to get a game and would you recommend getting this?
"It's a good game but it contains alot of bullshit.

The devs don't support the game anymore which sucks"
"Nope. Don�t get me wrong, it�s fun, but there will be practically no new content coming and very very minimal support to the game. If that doesn�t deter you, the overall design of maps is abysmal. The game engine is phenomenal, so that�s one upside. If you still want to buy it then i�d wait until they fix this xp glitch, as right now you don�t earn any weapon xp at all when playing matches, and it�ll probably be a long time before it gets fixed"
"In its current state, no. If the bugs go away and Activision stops sabotaging it, then get it in a sale. The Campaign is definitely good, and Multiplayer is best described as...50/50. The good times are great in Multiplayer, but the bad times are insufferable."
"I disagree with the other people telling you it's not worth it. I would totally buy it if it looks fun to you. They're saying there's no new content coming but since you haven't played it you have over a year's worth of content to go through. There's a ton of content to satisfy you. It will be a long time before you get sick of that. I've got over 20 days played since launch and I'm not sick of it yet. I think it's a fantastic game. If you play search and destroy, you won't dislike the maps, hell they're not as bad as most people say in respawn either. The fan base will never be satisfied. They are correct about there being some bugs right now but they'll probably fix it soon so just wait a week or two."
"If you want to �stay in the loop�, buy Cold War. There�s going to be new content for that game and it�s a fresh experience. Sure MW is better, but CW is a lot of fun and you can still get a lot from it. Zombies is also a big plus for CW, if you are into that."
It�s on sale right now so yes
"Yeah bro, I love this game. It�s easily my favorite cod ever. I already got Damascus back in like July, but took a break from MP after. Now I�m getting all the dlc guns Damascus just because the grind is fun, although I�m dreading the double kill challenge with the crossbow lol."
"Bro I despise the crossbow. I unlocked it early on and honestly wish I can skip it. Right now I got gold on 3 ARs, so the grind for plat ARs is almost over."
"Good to hear but it is crazy how these video games really have folks hooked on grinding for cosmetic items that do not directly influencegameplay.  I just can't understand it, especially when most players will not see your skins or camps."
"Heh, that�s true. I�m a completionist honestly, i try to get all challenges/achievements in most of the games I play. Guess it�s really down to personally preference"
"Yeah following this game through the seasons was really fun. Season 4 and 5 were peak for me because the new maps and guns were awesome, and my friends upgraded from warzone so we all played the new MP maps together 

Hopefully the next MW is just as good"
"Really hope the next game is a MW or a Ghosts 2 ( please don�t hate me but I actually liked Ghosts). The guns are super cool in MW, and I actually notice a difference jumping from one AR to another"
"OP of you're going for damascus don't forget you only have to get season 0 weapons gold, look up which they are"
"Yup, thanks for the heads up! I had a previous post asking about this, I was recommended [this website](https://www.ggrecon.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-damascus-camoflage)"
They actually tried new things which is nice the whole Doorfare stuff and footsteps is fun.
"Yep, although it�s a small change but mounting helped me play more tactical. Feel like spec ops lol. The funny thing is when I go back to Cold War I try to mount only to realize it�s not a thing in this game"
"Well, I don�t want to spoil your fun, but just wait until that sbmm kicks in

I got the game during launch, and still play it."
"Oh trust me, i get my ass kicked regularly in this game. It was incredibly hard getting gold for some of my ARs at times, but I honestly like a challenge and don�t really care about my K/D."
"People always say this but I still feel like I haven't felt sbmm kick in lol

I do notice that the game matches groups with other groups. When I queue with my friends (even the ones with significantly lower KD) the lobbies get harder because we get matched against other groups queueing together"
It have bin shit since day one!
Yet here you are over a year after it�s release commenting about it.

SMD you fuckin chomo
"This has been a problem since the beta, welcome to the club."
Damn like that though? I felt like Sherlock Holmes finding that shit out.
Drop shot? Its been around since sweating was invented.
But it got more common.
So being better is being a sweat?
"Its just annoying, and you probably do it."
"I can't pull the trigger without squeezing the R3 button. It used to mean I always did a melee after every shot. So I changed it to the tactical setup on the controller. Now every time I take a shot, I dive to the floor. Some people ask how I do it, others get annoyed ;-)"
"Oh that was me, until I stopped and just started walking. (I still run a lot but like ya) And do you have the Grau?"
"Dropshots are easy to counter, git gud"
Weeb stfu kid I almost have damascus (U gonna say that I have it)
Bunch of hackers being lame.
Glad we got a programming wizard over here to keep is informed on how to fix the game
You really think a company that�s backed by genocide isn�t about money?
"In my opinion it�s a fault, they set the infection thing (it�s declared in the description) with no xp gain but they�ve got the thing for the whole modalities.."
Oh it's true it's damn true I'll buy cold wat on sale tho cause I like zombies not when they tell me too
Cold War bussin
It's a bust alright.
ive also noticed looking at certain spots drop my frames from 140 to 50
"Of course, imagine if this bug was happening on the day of release. It'd be patched within hours"
"I kinda had a theory about this. With all the banhammers and no weapon xp. People creating new accounts aren't going to easily level up. It's easier to buy packs. 

""If you want to play you gotta pay.""

\-Activision"
Entire thing is intentional. I�m sure they can fix it instantly if they wanted to. Fuck the devs
Fuck Activision!
yeah looks a little fishy to me... i am unlocking camo challenges tho!
Its really sketchy I'll say that Wonder if anyone at MW wants to speak. Like someone else said imagine if this happened at launch it'd be fixed by the next day it's been a week lol
It�s almost like they want you to buy the new game. Wow couldn�t imagine.
"Lol just like how the ads on a video work perfectly but the video itself is a buffering mess. People that buy these games and Activision will never learn until they stop buying them. Stop buying the games. I bought Modern Warfare because they did a damn good job with the bait and switch but I wasn�t falling for that shit twice. I hadn�t bought a COD since BO1 before that and I don�t intend to until SBMM is returned to how it was in the past games like BO1 and MW2. I don�t even know why people were shocked to find out BO2 was the one where it was ramped up, I felt it immediately. I felt it even more in BO3. 

With companies trying to force SBMM and force people into competitive play styles, I�ve gone back to my roots of single player games. If you�re on PC or PS, I highly recommend Horizon Zero Dawn. I played it on Ps4 on release and I�m replaying it on PC and it�s fantastically fun and satisfying to bullet time a robotic dinosaur and pop weak spots with a bow and arrow. This game makes you feel so badass."
Yea I just try and not give a damn about gettin killed over and over again I just quit the lobby or just fuck around chase people with the knife or annoyingly snipe people they hate that. It's just a game at the end of the day.
"me and my friends said ""fuck it"" and just went onto spec ops, you still earn weapon xp there lol"
"Ya we need to call this bullshit out.
How do you have XP bug when nothing should be done to touch that mechanism"
no this is a glitch that's been around for 6 days I wish they would sticky this there are so many posts about it
"Damn thanks, I haven�t seen any of those other posts"
ya this games fucked activision doesn't care anymore
[this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lg7pq9/found_a_way_to_get_passed_the_xp_shitshow_of_mp/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
All I know is that theres squad spawns in this game so you spawn as a team. Yea I sometimes spawn in the lines of sight of enemies.
"I would get it if it were only an issue on Shipment, but it's pretty poorly designed which leads to awful spawns on most maps. Rust is probably the worst offender. Your whole team can get trapped in the same corner for the better part of a match.

Not to mention spawning exactly on the thermite you just threw, or at the precise point you just placed a killstreak, neither of which would otherwise be a valid spawnpoint. It's hard coded into the spawn algorithm... ...why?"
"I've basically put at least 30 days play time into every COD since MW1 so I think I have a little historical perspective, and I'm with you completely.

Yes, the map design in this game is really poor, but the spawns, since day one, have been like something out of pre-release version. In all the CODs previous to this one (with a handful of exceptions that were patched quickly, like the shooting through the crate spawnkill on WWII and the revenge spawn problem in MW3) I could probably count on one hand the number of times an enemy spawned in a location that I had line of sight to. Now it's basically the norm, and it should *never* happen.

One of the fundamental elements of COD was the tactics of ""pushing the spawns,"" like in Domination you'd take only two of the flags on purpose, so you could kind of encircle the third flag and pick off guys as they came out of their end. Now that kind of tactical play is almost impossible, because you have guys from the other team constantly spawning within spitting distance of your own end, often just far enough out of eyesight that they can shoot you in the side of the head.

One of the posts I've seen more times in this sub than any other is people complaining ""why don't people play the objective in objective modes?"" and I strongly believe it's because of the spawn problem. Sure in objective modes you'll have a percentage of players that will always try and play the objective, but for that ""swing vote"" in the middle (of which I'm certainly one) it seems pointless for the most part in this game, because the spawns themselves have no respect for the concept of playing tactically - why am I going to hold a flag in Domination, or a Headquarters, or whatever, when the enemy team can spawn in a position to the side of, or behind me, where they can kill me before I even know they're there?

This seems like an entirely fixable problem - I mentioned the MW3 ""revenge spawns"" earlier, and that was an issue that persisted for barely a week or two, back in the glory days of MW3 when Robert Bowling (fourtwozero) was IW's community liason - occasionally in FFA modes, if you killed someone, they'd respawn somewhere behind you on the map, so just by running forward, they could find and kill you. One single update and the problem was remedied. I have to believe that the spawns in this game are the way they are because either IW or Activision want them that way - perhaps they have some kind of advanced metrics on the playerbase that tells them that despite all the anger and complaints, the way they're doing it now is either causing players to play more, or somehow spend more money."
"Spawns are bad in this game, I have a hole in my desk because after a failed attempt to retake an OBJ in HQ the whole enemy team spawned behind me. At the end of the map, when my whole team was less than 20m away, but because their guy was still alive in the OBJ when it ended they all got to brutalise me from behind. 

Now, this might be an unpopular opinion, but I think extending the play area to make larger maps would potentially help with spawning. The smaller maps like Shipment and Rust are  a complete joke in regards to spawns and shoothouse is often rife with spawn killing."
Nah man that�s pretty fuckin concise and accurate from my point of view. They haven�t been fixed yet so there�s not a chance that will be addressed in this game
"It's the shitty maps.  Promote camping everywhere, making it impossible to safely spawn somebody in unoccupied territory."
"Spawns in this game are incredible compared to Cold War. Will never complain again after I played Cold War, that game is god damn awful"
"Yeah its sad really to see this happen to a AAA game a year and a half post launch and a year after i even purchased the game
I reinstalled like 2 days ago and was let down AGAIN that this game STILL has issues
And ita honestly unacceptable
I play MP for 3 hours get like 3k XP ONLY THRU CHALLANGES
I go to WZ or as i call it BrokeBoiO'Duty and get XP JUST FINE
But i hate WZ so i guess ill just spend another 7 months back in Hitman"
Xp bug in the game right now
"Ah, I see. Thanks"
Because activision wants everyone to play cold war
Can I fix this bug somehow?
"I couldn�t tell you, I�m sorry dababy pls forgive me"
Dababy forgives you
Im still getting 10k+ so can't really say
half my posts don't show up on this sub I have no idea why. tried msging mods but they don't respond
Do what i said below. I have the same problem and that works. Dont know why it got so downvoted
"Do you have an android phone, or a pc?"
I have both but was using my pc
This game is just fucked right now. I dont get any xp at all
"the workaround is when they disappear if and when they decide to actually address the 20 different bugs with this patch.

This shit has happened before (eg with Gaz). it's just a visual bug, they cannot be done, same as all the other battle pass missions can't be done unless you bought the actual pass when it was active."
"Same, dunno wtf is going on.
Infinity Ward is being  silenced on all social media platforms, literally no updates.
And Raven's updating of Warzone fucking breaks my Modern Warfare.

Random Operator missions came in and cannot be completed. Hitmarketer missing, XP not tracking.

WTF Activision, you wanna ruin Warzone, go ahead, don't touch Modern Warfare, let IW release new content."

"There�s nothing in the files that says when bundles are released. If that were the case we�d have known all along. 

These same people claimed Soap was going to release on the 4th. I haven�t seen him running around yet, how bout you?

"It would make sense that if rumors are true and a new wz map based on cw map is coming, that they'd release snow based operators when snow based wz map comes out."
Doesn't surprise me this game is falling apart and they can't give 2 shits. I'm surprised mods haven't censored this post as well
The reason: they want you to play Cold War.
"Jokes on them, I don't play shitty games. I gave that snoozefest a try, couple of times in fact."
Not gonna do it
"Wow you're giving me a relief, thats because the new contents are at LEAST in March.

I have a dread feeling inside me that thought the new content will only drop RIGHT before the next MW came out as part of the 'teaser'"
Yeah honestly I expect this too at this point. Releasing it to coincide with the MW2 announcement or whatever
Been waiting for that Samurai Ronin since I saw someone post about it !
"1. There's likely going to be no directly new playable content for MW. MWs life cycle is over. Warzone will continue to exist but its Cold War's year now. This is how COD works.

2. There's no way for leakers to know, it's all speculation."
"Stop asking and wondering why they aren�t putting updates and content out for MW. ITS AM OLD COD, ITS LIFE CYCLE IS OVER, MOVE ON"
"It's a 2 year old game that cost 50 fucking bucks and has 2 million active players, the reason why they don't even keep the game playable is because suckers like you will just blow 50 bucks yearly for a new COD regardless of how garbage it is."
"Content content content.  The only thing you kids care about is content, as though you play the game not because you enjoy it, but because you're virtually materialistic.  Funny thing is, all the great players I know couldn't care less about content because they don't need cool gun skins to make them feel like they're better at the game."

"I would definitely say its still worth it, but it is going to be a tedious grind. And yes, you can get multiple points for a gun in one match, if you get 30 its 2 points, 45 is 3 points, etc."
"thanks, would you say getting obsidian for the my two favorite guns and most used 

amax and kar) would be quicker then going for damascus?

also i forgot to ask, for damascus, do i need to get gold on every weapon including weapons they added after launch? or just the weapons it launched with?"
"Use this tracker, it's so helpful to keep track of where you're at. 

https://damascus.now.sh/"
thank you very much! that is exactly the kind of list i was looking for!
"If you plan on only using a few guns only and rather not use any others, stick to obsidian. Obsidian on a couple guns will be way faster then all weapons golds( base weapons from start of game minimum) for Damascus. Regardless, for obsidian you need to have gold first on the weapons you want obsidian, and then it will start tracking for obsidian. You can get more than 15 kills a game and it will track. If you get like 27 kills in sometimes rounds up to count as two. By the end you�ll get 3000 kills on your weapon for obsidian. This is all assuming your playing MP too."
"thanks do you have a list of what i need to get gold on for damascus? its not as clear as in cold war were for example it clearly stated for rifles you need 5 gold camos to get diamond and so on, but in modern warfare it says for every weapon in the weapon class which is not true since i think its only the base weapons or a mix of base weapons and added weapons"
"I can honestly say only go for obsidian on the guns you enjoy using and use the most, I did it for everything in the game and it almost killed the game for me. As for damascus it's still worth going for if you want it bad enough it only takes a month or two to do depending on your skill level and for the most part was kinda fun."
after the match the other team started talking shit and the couple on my team started spewing the most racist stuff
"this issue has been plastered all over this subreddit so yes other people are also experiencing this issue, some other things that I have found are that some people also experience lag, crashes, bad fps, hit marks not registering, and some operator challenges that you do not actually have such as mara's skin from season 1 battle pass and you can not actually complete this. This was caused by an update about a week ago and since then multiplayer is broken other things like co-op and warzone do give exp though so you might want to give that a try"
I'm actually currently not getting any weapon xp at all
Yeah majority of us are experiencing it it�s most likely due to the new update it�s completely fucked us all over
Same
New update. Less cash has been winning plunder
I unlocked the Striker last night and played a couple of games. 49 kills got it to level 4. IDK if this is slower than usual but it doesn't seem too bad.
You can't get it below 4GB?
I was able to in the first 2 hours i had the game. It updated and now i cant get it down at all. Is 8gb of ram not enough?
Could you post some screenshots?
Oof. Gotta throw the whole console away bro I�m sorry
I just loaded up the game and I am stuck on the same screen. Help!?
[deleted]
Get an Xbox /S
Just came to check if anyone else is having this same issue. I�m on PS4. What are you on?
[deleted]
"I can help. When you start the game and it says connecting to online services, press cancel and go offline. Once youre done, go to downloads and look for what youre missing and download it. Happened to me in coop"
If the game is loaded from the disc and warzone is downloaded via online it crates a conflict. You have to load all of it either from l the disc or online. Hope this helps.
"Hey bro you have not downloaded multiplayer pack1 
Go to your cod and see if you have any add on for your game"
I�ll use the match trigger for aesthetics on some sidearms but other than that lightweight is king
It all depends if you�re using akimbo or not on the pistol. I use lightweight for akimbo and I think the match for a single pistol.
I do use the heavy trigger on heavy handling gun like the Desert Eagle or the 357. Since the Lightweight trigger can easily throw your accuracy out of the window and it�s wasting ammunition.
357 with the heavy trigger fires almost as slow as some snipers (not really but it feels like it)
The match-grade trigger is good but only if you're running your handgun with a close-range built shotgun/smg. But literally only in the case you need you handgun to be made for a farther range than what your primary is capable of.
"I mean, if you lose to a pistol while you use a rifle/smg/shotgun or lmg, the attachment is not the problem.

Unless its snake shot, fuck snake shot."
I find it annoying to die to someone armed with a pistol shooting 1500 bullets per second but thats normal
Just tap faster lol
the firerate on pistols with the light trigger is very realistic. well trained people with a good trigger can fire just as fast
"Pistols aren't very strong compared to the other guns in the game, so if someone manages to make the pistol work, more power to 'em.

The one exception to this is hardcore, where the pistol's superior handing makes it quite good. Then again, everything is good in hardcore so..."
Pistols and by extension lightweight trigger are asinine because the overkill and amped combo. Sniper + AssVal...
"Jeez, these are legitimately the worst replies that I have ever seen about mouse sensitivity. Ever. Holy fuck. I'm not a 2.5 K/D player but I have to intervene before these morons confuse you.

Your overall sensitivity is determined by two things: Mouse DPI, and In-game Sensitivity. Your 'eDPI' (i.e. effective DPI) is your mouse DPI multiplied by your in-game sens. So with an in-game of 5 and a DPI of 800, your eDPI would be 4000. That would be the same 360 distance as 1600DPI and 2.5 in-game sens, however, with 1600 DPI you would technically have more fine control because each inch of mouse movement is divided into 1600 parts instead of 800. Functionally, any DPI over 400 is fine and you probably won't be able to feel a difference. 400 is popular among older CS players and 800 is more common for people who didn't start with CS.

Windows sensitivity is not relevant. Don't let people lie to you about this.

Generally speaking, high sensitivity is a disadvantage in PC shooters. Yes, you read that right. I don't know what fucking drugs people are taking on this subreddit that made them think higher sensitivity is better for mouse players. The lower your sensitivity is, the more control you have. If you have to move your mouse .000124 inches to hit the head, it's going to be really hard. If you can move it anywhere between .5 and .6 inches and still be on the haed, it's going to be a lot easier. As long as you can turn around in a single swipe, turning will take essentially the same amount of time. The travel time of your mouse is generally negligible.

Generally speaking, the advice that people give is to use the lowest sensitivity that you can handle. For many people, that means making it so moving your mouse from the center of the pad to the edge of the pad results in a 180 degree turn in hipfire. This means that you can always turn and fight somebody who shoots you from behind with a single swipe of your mouse. Most people have limited mousepad space, so this method works well for them. If you have a nice huge mousepad, you just want to set it to whatever constitutes a comfortable single swipe 180.

Most players will have a ADS sens modifier that 'equals' their hipfire. What feels 'identical' between hipfire and zoomed fire is actually somewhat complicated but the short version is that the 'screen distance' should feel constant between hipfire and scoped fire. 

You don't actually have to make them equal, but that's the most common choice. If you want to be able to spin around quickly but then slow down and be really accurate while scoped, it's a viable strategy. A lot of R6 players and pros use a lower ADS sensitivity because you ADS 99.99% of the time when fighting in R6. Your hipfire doesn't need to be particularly precise so you can live with a relatively high hipfire for quickly checking rooms. 

Warzone is kind of weird because there is some hipfire and a lot of high mobility turning and jumping and shit, but also a lot of long range tracking. ADS times are also really slow so you can't necessarily scope-unscope every time you need to turn 15 degrees. IDK, I prefer having them match so that things always feel equal whether I'm playing R6, Warzone, Overwatch or even a singleplayer game. 

So overall... meh. It's not necessary to play a low sensitivity, but it's usually better to do so. 2000 eDPI is probably the lower bound for what is sane for hipfire. Below that it's just too much work to turn around and loot relative to how people move. Somewhere around 16000 eDPI is probably the upper bound for what is sane. Realistically though, unless you're fairly restricted for space there's very little reason to play above 6000 eDPI. I think 4000 is a good starting point. With your 50% ADS though, maybe try 6000 eDPI for hipfire so that your scoped shots aren't super slow."
"my hipfire sens is 15.50 at 800 DPI, low zoom ads 1.0 and high zoom ads is 1.30. and yes if you are acurate with high sens you do have an advantage over most other players. if you do go for a higher sens, stick with it because you are going to miss a LOT of shots in the beginning. you could also increase it gradualy over a period of time and stick with what works for you (that is what i did)."
"22.50 at 1750DPI, just a lazy wrist-aimer. Flicking is way easier with high sens."
I never really touch the ingame settings for my mouse and leave it at 1. I do run a 1800/2000dpi.
"I've lefts ads sense where it is, but in game Is a 1.5 and dpi is 3600"
I mainly jus want it so the camo grind isn�t a pain in the ass
i got the riot shield and most of my launchers done on shoot the ship. I wouldve been in miserable on any other map where nobody gets over 20 kills because of how slow they are.
"Camo grind is a pain in the ass without it because every other map is a campfest. The game itself is slow and tedious prestige of shoot house, rust and shipment. Even old maps brought back have turned into camp fests. Hell, even half my rust matches are 90% camper trash."
Okay and the question was about the rest of the maps not allowing for a camo grind. Did you even read the post or just the title?
Wanting a small map playlist isn't any different to any cod.
"For real, there's always going be a section of the playerbase that only like small maps. For what it's worth I think the maps in this COD are great 

I remember back in BO2, when Nuketown 24/7 was in, something like a quarter of all games were being played in that playlist."
I only want shipment just because  it is a cluster fuck of fun and makes challenges to earn blue prints a million times easier shipmeant is just a blast it�s no different then ppl only wanting to play nuke town I just want to play it because it�s the only map that small and that fun I don�t have problems with many of the other maps I just enjoy the fast pace 50 kills 50 deaths it�s just preference
The rush of adrenaline is unmatched
"I may be in the minority, but I don't think the remaining multiplayer maps are that bad; the bigger problem is spawn logic. My go-to modes have always been headquarters, hardpoint, and domination, and the first two are decent in MW with spawns generally behaving as one might expect (HQ/hardpoint located between two spawns). In domination however, it seems that spawns are always polar between sides of the map, such that spawning with A control is the same as spawning with AB control, no matter the size of the map or positioning of the enemy team. Sure, if the whole enemy team is encroaching on B, that makes sense. But on larger maps, there's no reason for spawning in initial spawn if your team has map control. It interrupts the flow of games and deters spawn trapping, which is great for less experienced players but really annoying for veterans of the series. Not only that, it seems that when IW updated Dom to make spawns less sticky, they completely reversed it such that spawn flips happen way too easily. Doing laps around the map while avoiding head glitchers and bush wookies feels more like battlefield than cod, but with faster ttk and better hiding spots. 

&#x200B;

Early on, playing multiplayer was almost unbearable because of map complexity and players reluctance to move around. Now that the game has some mileage and with SBMM, a lot of players in my lobbies are using this hybrid style of aggressive movement and good positioning. As someone who doesn't like jetpack CoD, this reminds me a lot of the previous MW titles... you can play aggressively, but it requires a lot of map knowledge and really good fundamental gun and movement skill. If it were just mounting on sightlines, or if were just twitchy slide cancelling, camera-ing, jump/drop shotting, I wouldn't like it... it's the combination of the two that makes multiplayer worth it, and most of the maps are well designed to accommodate both of those playstyles. 

&#x200B;

Now we just need Highrise, Terminal, Bog, and Favela and the game will be the perfect nostalgia engine."
I don�t mind the ttk i still could turn around and stop someone from killing me even if they shot first or kill a team by myself but also couldn�t take 20 shots to the head and mow everyone down with a meta gun. The spawns are ass but shoot house and shipment aren�t good representations of that since you could spawn in �sniper alley� in the middle and get spawn killed on shoot house often and shipment...well you can�t change those spawns. I like all the maps some of them aren�t as fun to play in as others but I didn�t have the issue lots of people had with only liking 2 maps. I�m just weird I guess
"Personally the only one I really dislike is Euphrates, and I havent played that in a while. Maybe Aniyah too. The rest are fine for me"
"10v10 objective modes are where MW�s maps shine.  TDM is a bit shit because most of the maps are slices of combat zones rather than straightforward arenas/paintball fields type maps, but 10v10 on larger maps fill out quite nicely (always gonna be campers so the larger maps are easier to avoid them on) and the medium/smaller maps like Hovec and Hardhat have enough hotspots to cater for virtually everyone.  Shoothouse caters for every playstyle in quite a sanitary environment (it�s literally a training compound so it makes sense that it�s full of angles) and Shipment is just unadulterated chaos, always has been and always will be."
if i�m playing multiplayer it�s shoot the ship. they don�t have bad maps but the rotation is just awful it�s the same four terrible maps
Azzcave and picaddili can go fuck themselves
fr ive getting most of the base maps rotated instead of the dlc maps
"Speaks more about the incompetent playerbase, not the game"
"Yep, hit the nail on the head here. :P"
"Ayo what�s your favourite maps on it? I�d say my top 5 (no order) are shoot house, Cheshire park, vacant, crash, gun runner"
"Shoot house, Rust, Hardhat, Shipment, Trench"
Big fan of scrapyard too
"For sure Shoothouse, Vacant, Gun Runner, Hackney, Khandor, and Hovec. I don't like respawn in this game but these are bearable for me."
"Mine are 1.shoot house, 2. Shipment, 3. Hackney, 4. Grazna, 5. Vacant"
This game has arguably and imo CODS best Search
Also Cyber Attack is fucking awesome. Hope it returns in MW2
"Their map could have been good if they cut it down in half. Like Grazna Raid. It�s such a fucking idiotic of a map. That shit should have been 12v12, not 6v6. Oil Rig is full of hidey-hole and have no fucking flow whatsoever, enemies just appear out of nowhere. Picadilly could have been cool if people would stop camping in the bus back at A. Eupharates Bridge is an abysmal on Dom, B flags have 100% clear view of the other team safe spawn(and the fact that they have the balls to put Invasion in the map but it�s outside of the map smh). Chesire is the most similar to Shoot House but can never beat ShootHouse, too many complexities and hidey-hole. The grey-blue-ish depressing tone of the map just aid the campers even more. You can�t never sit in a corner without getting spotted in ShootHouse because it�s colorful and have the sun shining on top of it. While people with the fucking full black roze skin can sit in a corner and totally blend in perfectly in Chesire. Honestly I can tolerate Chesire but visibility is just a disaster."
Enemies appearing out of nowhere is such a frustrating thing about this game. You can never predict  where someone might be so you have no incentive to move because you are going to get shot from one of the 7 angles . The maps  are such  a mess
"I just want a map filter, and if possible prop hunt"
"It's not that the maps are bad, it's that the other maps were designed to be slower and more tactical, whereas Shipment and Shoothouse are the small maps designed to get you into fights every few seconds. This in turn gives you the most dopamine rushing to your brain so players flock to the playlist rather than the other stuff. Players that prefer more a more tense experience will play something like S&D or CA."
"People want more small 6v6 maps, I don�t understand why the game keeps trying to push these larger maps on us when it�s clear the fan base wants to jump right back into the action when they die."
"The demand is for a variety of reasons.  Some people hate every other map in the game because it might take more than 5 seconds to find someone.  But most people just want to grind camos (As the majority of comments pretty much confirm) and only want the easiest option.

Personally, I like most of the maps in the game.  They're not MW2-tier (Although Hovec Sawmill and Atlas Superstore are two of my favorite maps of all time), but I find most of them to be pretty enjoyable.  And honestly, I think if people only want to play this game for 2 maps and aren't getting their way, they should find another game to play.  It's not getting reworked at this point, and if people are still playing this game years down the road and still begging for Shoot the Ship, something is wrong with the players, not the game.

I mean hell, what happened to all the kids proclaiming Black Ops Cold War as the savior of CoD with the best maps and best gameplay?  That was supposed to be the answer to the slower gameplay and non-competitive map design that ""plagued"" MW, yet this subreddit still seems to be full of people wanting MW to be just like Black Ops."
"Honestly, I never reall understood all this thirst for Shoot the Ship. I mean, yeah, easy farming, but it gets boring really fast. I liked almost all maps, and enjoy playing them, and don't feel like there are few maps only that are worth to be played."
"I just hope they learn for mw2 that we like action packed close quarters maps, not giant battlefield shit."
Only reason I want shoot the ship is to camo grind it�s not that deep tbh
I only want it for camos
"i was literally saying this the other day and got downvoted lol. I just cant enjoy those bigass maps like aniyah incursion, euphrates bridge, grazna raid, cus it takes a min to find someone, and most of your time spent is running back to the action after you spawn miles away on the edge of the map. Most people end those games with 15-20 kills, which is just not ideal for any camo grinding. In shoot the ship i could get 40-50 in one game and knock out a bunch of challenges simultaneously."
Most people use it for getting damascus soo..
"I would play the mode even if they stopped you getting camos, shoot, ship and rust are the only good maps"
The only thing it says a lot about this game is that it is just like any other CoD once a new one is released.  It is going to decline in support as usual.  It is part of the cycle and it doesn't look like it is going to change anytime soon.
"Respawn definitely isn�t the only reason ppl want these maps only. Part of it, but think bigger"
Is there a current shoot the ship playlist in rotation right now? Never bought the full game when I made the switch over to PC but still want to grind for camos. Wondering if it's worth forking over the dough for the full game at this point.
"Nah, it was up for a while but pulled a few days ago, will be months till it�s added again"
I want to play Rust the most
"Someone needs to shut this sub down. Literally nothing constructive gets discussed in detail here. Same post just a different day. �Just my thoughts�? Literally EVERYONE on this sub has these thoughts....every day. It�s annoying, it�s cliche, and people need to let it go. The game is staying exactly the way it is right now and the cycle of map playlists will remain as well. Stop the madness for the love of god. Holy shit."
"Yeah, it feels like the mod team is basically non-existent most of the time, just the same mindless, low-effort stuff over and over. :("
"This game has good maps, the players on Reddit are just garbage"
Agreed. I love the maps tbh
"The demand for Shoot The Ship tells me one thing. People clearly don't like MW as much as they claim. Sure some of the maps are horrible to play on but the fact people claim the game is ""unplayable"" without those maps says a lot."
Shipment and Shoothouse get us camos. The rest of the maps don�t.
"Yeah, accelerating a hard ass grind helps busy people try to get this faster"
"I've been saying this since the start man...

If this is the best CoD game ever, why everybody likes playing on only two of the maps?"
I agree id rather play cold war because the maps are much better. Also the groza with thermal scope and famas with recoil attachments fast ammo and ranger barrel are supa hot fire!
I hate all other maps shoothouse 24/7 spoiled me now. The other maps aren't completely terrible but there not as fun
Yea i only play Shoot the Ship and Gunfight. Regular MP got some good maps like Hackney Yard and Khandor Hideout but shit like Crash and Picadildo is straight up cancer.
idk but lately I see people run full warzone classes in search lol. Played against a guy with an mp5 and grau lol
"play a few of em too, heartbeat sensor too"
"You probably just found more than usual randomly, it�s definitely always been a thing"
They need something to use when they miss the easiest shot using an spr lol
"Playing against snipers is horrible, makes you scared to move around as much cause you don�t want to get abruptly taken out in 1 shot; the worst are the pakis with kar98 n 725 overkill"
"""pakis"""
"The only time it should give you an error is if you unlinked it twice, telling you you can�t unlink it again. So that�s definitely strange. You tried closing browser and doing it again?"
It worked when I used a pc. I was afraid for suddenly getting shadow banned. I�ve heard they can do that shit to anyone. Hacker or not.. Sounds weird
Worst part is there has been no official comment on it that I can find... Like at least say something like your looking into it...
i think there was a tweet from ATVI replying to someone that complained about weapon xp. they said the team is looking into it. idk how long to expect a fix tho
Bruh i was trying to rank up my gun and had no idea about this glitched. Wasted 2 hours of my life thinking it was ranking up. Does it work if you play spec ops or warzone?
"Last time I played warzone my guns still leveled up, it�s just MW as far as I�m aware"
"Spec ops is low xp, warzone is fine for me. Grabbing a chopper and running around doing afk contracts wasn't what I had in mind though."
"Spec ops and Warzone both work. Do the recon missions in WZ and it'll rank up pretty fast. I play blood money or whatever it's called. Spec Ops really isn't worth it since it gives so little weapon XP. If you hate WZ as I do, it's gonna be a pain tryna rank up, which is why I opt for blood money since you can choose your class and you get to respawn."
"Started grinding damascus two days before they pulled plug on shoot ship and the update removed weapon xp. I was making good progress, platting my subs and snipers. After getting gold for my other max lvl weapons in the post-update hell-scape of multiplayer, I have now started completing all the available camos for guns I only have partially lvl'd up... imagine the shame of having 1000 kills for the Famas and only 1/3 of the camo challenges completed. Today, I spent two hours dropping 50 bombs in ground war with a lvl 11 LMG. If I had a physical disc to eject and break, I would, but uninstalling wouldn't be enough. Maybe its time to tank my KD with C4 until I reach the promise land of ""bot lobbies"" or receive that legendary Activision ban."
"Literally same. I decided that I wanted Damascus and eventually obsidian for at least one of my weapons and 2 days later I stopped being able to level my weapons. too bad too, I had almost got gold on the traditional looking pump shotty (1 camo set away), the MP7, and the AK-47."
Yeah mine was intermittent tonight. I barely made one level in a time period it should have leveled about 5 times
"Wait, today is Thruday ain't it?  


Alright, today's the day the game can get updated to fix this shit. And new playlists"
Is there like a weekly update or something?
"It�s because they don�t care about the game anymore. Cold War is out (even tho objectively, Cold War kinda sucks IMO) and they have no reason to work on modern warfare anymore, now they�re breaking it. 

Activision, please. Fix YOUR game that YOU paid people for. Give us season 1-4 back. I don�t want any of this garbage anymore, just season 1-4. 

It�s really sad how a company as big as activision just stops supporting (intentionally or unintentionally) a massively popular, multi platform, AAA title. This was the biggest game of the year. Hell, of the past 3 years. This was the biggest and most anticipated game."
"Yeah, I played it about 2 weeks, and while I think CW has some serious potential, a lotta really bad design choices kept it back. MW2019 is far superior and even if they had done a really good job with CW, I still think I would prefer MW2019."
I just switched to Infinite Warfare for a bit!
"I would, but last time I played I had to deal with terrible hit reg, and now, after deleting it and attempting to redownload it, it has gotten stuck on the installation part. I loved that game a few years ago, but it's too broken for me to even attempt to play it anymore."
I think it's fixed. I just leveled up my ak.
"Yeah I gained a whopping 100xp in 20 games earlier, don�t think it�s fixed unless it was like last couple hours."
Hey dude - use this link https://support.activision.com/account-recovery. Same thing happened to me and I got my account back but unfortunately my account got banned before it was recovered.
"Thank you ! Sorry for your account, they can�t unban you ?"
The hamster died
LMAO
"https://support.activision.com/onlineservices.Call%20of%20Duty:%20Modern%20Warfare.html

Yep! Servers are down right now."
Oh damn. Got done playing not too long ago guess I got lucky lol
"Yup I can't connect either, does this mean they may be fixing the xp issue?"
Only u can hope!!
"fingers crossed this is to fix various things including hitmarkers, I seem to be getting issues much more on PS4 than people on other platforms"
"Sigh, this is so not cool. Having had an appalling KDR for the past few days (well, weeks really), I knew this was the night I�d be on fire. Y�all have had a lucky escape, just sayin�."
guys the ps servers were down!!
Oh shoot. Thanks for that update!
okay i�m not the only one.
"I can, still no weapon xp so I don't know i am even bothering to connect."
Yea they honestly not supporting multiplayer anymore
Yea wtf is this bs. Activision really does want to kill this game
Lag has made this game unplayable since last update. Now I'm just stuck on connecting to online services.
I can�t of course
I cant connect as well...
Oh great I was just about to finally sit down and play
Same here! But my friends are all playing without problems...
I'm back up.
I'm back up with a surprising improvement to my lag situation
"Even worse, my hard drive is corrupt"
"I think that's just how it goes sometimes. Get stomped a few times, and SBMM will stick you in easier lobbies."
Pretty much. I stomped a couple games of Free-For-All earlier and then BOOM sweat lords soaked me up and I only got 4 kills. Then back to stomping after that.
"Via the companion app, my current k/d is .39, .40, .33, .33, 0.08, etc.

I'm usually 1.2 on a good week. There's some serious precognitive shit going on by players too, shooting as I move round a corner, or shooting blindly as I drop down from somewhere. I have to keep checking if CrossPlay is off (I'm on PS4) as I've seen aimbots/trackers in action, and it's similar.

V odd, and frankly not enjoyable at the moment. This isn't me being a bad player, I just seem to be in the wrong bracket, and it's only been since the last update.

Also wtf is up with all these single digit ranked players absolutely destroying everyone? Do they start a new account, buy a weapon and go mental with it? After honing their talents, they then go in the <.5 k/d bracket?"
"Maybe Smurfs? Also, i just saw 3 prestige vs my team (max level 54)."
"I refuse to get stomped, I just leave and re-join a new lobby if shit doesn�t go my way."
This is the most pathetic thing I have heard and I hope this is a joke
"I mean yeah, that's typically how it works. CoD gets released yearly between the 3 developers and games need at least 3 or 4 years of development time. It's highly likely the majority of them are already hard at work on their next title. 

We know Treyarch did Cold War and Sledgehammer is doing this year's title, so Infinity War will likely need their next game ready for 2022. 

There will likely won't be anymore major updates for MW, it pretty much is what it is at this point. I still enjoy jumping in for a couple games here and there, but I wouldn't expect any big changes."
"Yeah, I don't expect anything else, tbh, just the fixes they need to patch out their most recent update. I love this game and it's sad to see it go, but alas! I do wish that they'd stop the yearly cycle and do a CoD every 2 or even 3 years. The hype is dying with the yearly cycle and the short amount of time to work on each title is really starting to show."
"Well, yes. 

After each year, the devs move on to their next project whilst the next COD takes the helm for the year. 

MW is done, it's unfortunate but I don't believe any game has ever had a large content drop AFTER the release of the next one. Warzone is going to be the exception, Raven is likely working on the Anniversary update. 

It's only different this year because Warzone is still attached to MW. If they had the resources, they'd probably seperate Warzone but since Warzone is so embedded into the core of MW (system, asset and coding wise) it's probably more hassle than it's worth at the moment. So MW is being dragged along for the ride"
Hate to see it
"Raven has taken over modern warfare fully which is why the quality is lower. They don�t appear to be a competent team.

 I said this in another thread, but look at how they handled Parks Heist and Handler skins. The character looks very good in Cold War, in MW she looks like Michael Jackson and her hair is literally balding bad. Cynthia from rugrats has more hair than her in MW. It�s a night and day difference. 

If they can�t even handle character skins properly imagine how incompetent their programmers are. 

Or don�t, just look at how they screwed up weapon xp last week and still haven�t managed to fix it. 

These guys can�t even get the store to operate correctly with the new bundles. It�s like they put the D team on this game now."
"I always thought Raven was pretty competent as a secondary team, one that works alongside other teams. I don't think they're bad, I just think Activision has pulled too many resources to be able to handle anything competently. CW was rushed because they have to release a new CoD yearly. I am under the opinion that this falls squarely on Activision and their greedy choices. Also, I was sure that Raven was only in charge of WZ, how long have they also been in charge of MW2019?"
"Trying to play some Modern Warfare, but, when I open the game, I am greeted with this message. When I check Blizzard for an update, it says the app is up to date so I don't know what the issue is. Really don't wanna have to install this massive game yet again. I'm on version 1.31.1.8594303. Is this the correct version?"
"So I�m not the only one 



I�ve had this happen twice in the past 2 days on plunder when I went to switch classes"
Nope! Not the only one.
Yah happened couple times - just backs out and get the loading screen saying fetching online profile or whatever. Sucks bc all my friends got Xbox and I�m only one w problem of getting black frozen screen or back to loading screen
Mine goes clear back to the XBOX screen. It's getting a little frustrating
"My wife and I can usually play one round. The moment mw attempts to load the next round, just as the map is loading, it crashes back to the home screen. If we don't reboot the xbox and attempt to get back into mw, it will either error with connection failed, i.e. ""unable to access online services"" for her profile. Or it sometimes will error with dev 5476."
"no, the disc just authenticates that you own modern warfare, without the disc (and without buying) you will only have warzone"
"On PS4, at least, it doesn't. You need to insert the disc to play if you got the physical copy."
If you used a physical copy to download the game you have to continue using the disc to verify the license.  If you bought a digital copy then you don�t need the disk.
"Warzone Plunder.  Go for contracts.  Getting 3000 to 5000  weapons XP per game and 10,000 to 15,000 regular XP."
"More specifically, grab a helicopter and go for supply run/recon contracts. They're the fastest contracts to do and only require transport. With a double EXP token you can get as much as 15k weapon EXP in a game."
Coop games having been giving me a lot of rank XP.
Do dailies in MP. Curse Activision at the end of each no_XP game.
Co-ops special ops are giving the most experience overall and weapons progression experience.
I am having that exact same issue it�s making me re download pretty much everything mp pack 2 and 3 also the high res pack and the compatibility pack
"i'm unable to connect to online services, but i'm able to get on bocw"
It might be the stupid updates fault
It happened before the update too
"Sometimes you make the right decision, and sometimes you make the decision right."
Agreed all the downloads and updates are excessive
Especially when they add literally nothing to multiplayer except breaking it.
"Bug, I started in season 2 and it will only unlock things I did from than till now. Won�t let me do any of the season 1 challenges."
"Thanks, was hoping to unlock some, but what bothers me the most is the fact that they are there and won�t �check� hahahahahha"
they are almost all from MW season 1 and none can be completed in any way
Thanks mate
It was data mined awhile ago that there were season 1 vault bundles which were multiple bundles that contained various items from the season 1 battle pass. They�ll probably do this for each season eventually starting with season 1.
"Here's my problem, when I'm in the game the windows OS main volume drops by it self to 50, but when I switch aplications the volume levels restore to 100. This makes my game sound really low. 

Sorry for the language in the video, I'm from Brazil."
"My discord audio works fine, game audio works fine, some reason I can�t talk or hear game chat, same issue?"
"Sometimes the game audio will periodically stop while I'm playing too, nothing helps but restarting in my experience"
Don't work for me
Looks like its time to reinstall!
"Already did that with the game and with de Windows, didn't solve the problem"

Mine was close to 200 all day yesterday. Every match was a shit show.
"i have been having high ping spikes in cw and mw this 2-3 days, and on discord people say are having the same problem, definitley a game problem, the last match everybody spiked to 180-200 [https://imgur.com/a/cMDHzPf](https://imgur.com/a/cMDHzPf)"
"I find it hilarious when people call 80 ping unplayable.


Its fine for a non competitive structure.


Count yourself lucky, 70 is the lowest i can get. Yeah it sucks when people have 20 and you have 70 but its really not that big of a gulf."
It�s not 80 plus ping that actually bothers me it�s the fact that it should and could be lower
There�s an XP bug in the game right now where no guns are levelling up
Ty man
Aye yo where u been
For real. If I have an issue the first thing I do is sort the subreddit by new posts and see if anyone's bitching. Is this not normal. It's incredible how many people don't look. Like I get the first day or two. But there's litterly at least 100 posts about this.
I had to watch it twice it happened so fast the first time lol nice clutch!
"Thanks! When watching it again I realised I only killed 5 of them lol, no idea what happened to the other guy"
"Such a wholesome lobby, I WANT THAT MORE!!"
They're rare but golden
Dual 32 round M19s. Nice
We need more ppl like that in cod
That sniper shot was nice
I do not understand why people use the long barrel AND monolithic on the sniper in search. Maybe if you're sniping cross map on arklov or something but all the other maps are way too small for it to make a difference and you just destroy your ADS time.
"I've been waiting over a month to get my account back, just spoke with them on chat and they said it was taking longer than expected to put back the pieces of the digital puzzle or something vague like that but not to worry that all would be as it was. So... friendly but not very helpful. There was no interest in screenshots or video caps like there seemed to be for some others. It's crazy how many people it seems to happen to. 

 Keep closing the chat window, refreshing the page and clicking on the chat icon again, you'll get on eventually. Just be prepared to wait about an hour and a half once you do."
Thanks for the reply. I just made an update to the post. Things just got much worse for me I think.
You had luck closing out of the �loading agent chat� window and reloading? I�ve probably done it 20 times with no luck yet.
They're too busy NOT fixing the weapon/level xp glitch and no hitmarker problems
Lmao it hit the claymore in his hnds
yeah lmao it had me hella confused for a minute
Lmao wow man
What game mode is this? Lmao
"Infected or reinfected.

Edit: that looks like Khandor Hideout, so I think it's just infected."
"I�m not joking when I say this but I got a hit marker with a throwing knife, on infected"
The last person gets extra health so if catch them with a throwing knife sometimes it�ll come up as a hit marker.
that fool had the power of god in his hands the moment you threw that knife
Same thing when I start in safe mode
Click on the options button next to play click on check for update
I had the same the other day but a simple reboot fixed it for me.
Yeah that fixed it for me.
Are you running off your gpu or cpu that could be why
"happened me some time, specially after wake up from sleep mode

normally restart or sing out fix it"
"I had this issue too where certain bundles don't show up in the store or armory. One thing that worked for me was going into edit loadout and searching for the gun in the bundle that has a blueprint that comes with it. Then make a loadout and hit store next to that specific gun, and additional bundles that aren't in the store or armory will show up. Hope this helps!"
"It isn�t Activision, it�s infinity ward."
Maybe but you can never be too sure at this point with all the pushing they do.
They don't show all the bundles anymore(even in armory). No one knows why they did it but now it only shows the ones in the store and a couple other ones
"Yeah just last week I got the undead forces bundle, not sure why they decided to do this."
The contingency bundle was in the actual $$$ store for me when I bought it did you check there?
The $$$ store?
"There�s been a discovered bug that prevents exp. Also  if u look at the other posts, 2/3 are your exact question."
You bullied those poor people
why tf can i not post on this sub bro
Its no longer stolen
He may get banned for the actions of the hacker while they were in possession of the account. Seen this happen multiple times. Just a heads up.
Get 2 factor authentication on the account and change the password as soo your friend gets it back
"I am pretty sure its just a problem within MW. They will most likely give an update to us soon. Also, my friends and I got some XP by just going into TDM but its a very occasional thing. Don�t use any double XP tokens either."
Go into co-ops special ops to level up weapons.  It is giving lots of experience and you can still grind camouflage challenges in multiplayer.
Thank you
"It�s a bug, Infinity Ward is working on a fix, until then, don�t use 2x Xp tokens. You can try leveling them up in plunder, some people said that it still worked there."
Co-op still works and gives more experience.
"Cant level up my weapon Xp at all, hopefully they fix leveling up soon"
There's currently no fix. It's a really annoying bug and they say they're working on it.
"I mean, the crouch peak shot was kinda cool, but they�re bots, they always walk single file."
...to hide their numbers
Yea I thought it was cool
Ehh
Just wondering if there�s a way to get it online
Or it could be the team of three people left to code for mw just fked it up
3 is too much lol
"Go to voice chat options and there�s a setting that mutes everyone except your party, but it might mute deathcoms"
Will check this out. Thanks!
F9 on PC is the hot key to mute voice chat. It's an Insta F9 tap at the end of games for me.
Damn that sounds awesome. I'm on PS4 tho @ \_ @
Leaving the match will work.
Stuck in the end game mode for about 15 seconds... and its annoying af. :/
It�s just you and maybe a couple other teams haha when die early in a game i don�t think you spectate a random till the very end of the match
"Yea the ""end-of-match"" chatter is what im talking about and my entire team hears it cause we all complain about it (were on console)."
"Ahhhh Halloween, that month was a blast"
"I wish people could look at this sub for more than 2 seconds before they make a new post..

Look at one of the 10,000 posts that have been made today about this bug and you'll have your answer"
People really think everyone just be living on Reddit lmao there�s a million people in this thread with new posts every minute
"I'm glad you took time out to write this, I am better because of it."
Holy jesus christ. You're probably the 94 billionth to post this.
trillionth\*
"I didn't check the subreddit itself, just looked for solutions or acknowledgement from Activision on Google and couldn't find it."
"Could you be less of a dick please? Some ppl just
Dont have the money at that specific time to get a pack or even the game in general."
its $10....... and its literally the point of seasons its for it to be  exclusive
Well this was a waste of time

Lol
Lit af
"yes, everyone is experiencing it. those missions aren't supposed to be visible and you cannot progress the. just a bug."
Did you get the S4 battle pass? There�s a bug where you can see all the operator challenges even if you didn�t get the battle pass that has the challenges. If you did get the season 4 battle pass and maxed it out then I�m not sure.
I only bought season 6. I was also going for other operator skins but it looks like they were part of season 4 now that I'm thinking about it (like Kyle's all dark skin). Thanks for your input my friend!
"Yes same here (operator Mara)... I wrote Activision support and you guessed it... no reply since 3 days, honestly fuck you Activision for letting me pay goddamn 60� and not getting the game as shown. I'm kinda losing hope here especially now that I'm hearing when you just buy MW you automatically get a Mara skin (her first skin with the black bulletproof vest), but I didn't get any skin for her (bought MW bout a week ago). Have been trying for maybe 5 days to do a mission for her but it's impossible since the game doesn't track anything at all. So yeah, I should thank Activision (InfinityWard/Raven) after all for making this choice so easy for me to never buy a game from them again. Adios cocksuckers, enjoy my 60� while you can but you won't get those sweet 500�+ that I would've probably spent on skins etc."
"The tracking isn�t the bug, the challenges aren�t supposed to be visible, which is the bug. The og Mara skin is no longer available."
"I understand man it is extremely frustrating. Let's not even talk about the insane number of hackers that we encounter in the game. I have a 0.89 kd (yes I'll proudly state a kd I earned) and I get buttfucked by hackers left and right in plunder and regular warzone. That was offtopic but anyways, operator missions is kinda what keeps me going back to this game. There isn't much to do right now honestly"
"Yeah, I got all excited thinking it was fixed but literally nothing's changed. How long has it been?? I did hear it's fixed for some ppl though, so I'm cautiously optimistic"
I just hate that the xp glitch has not been fixed at all? It�s a shame that they just don�t care abd don�t even wanna fix it rightaway
"same here, lag started yesterday. all bugs still present. for once the game is LITERALLY unplayable so I stopped booting it up."
"At least you aren�t in my boat. Modern Warfare on my PS5 forces me to redownload the multiplayer packs every couple of days. I have 0.5mb/s internet. 

It�s hell."
My whole modern warfare got corrupted so I had to re-download the entire digital version again on my PS4 it took me almost a week of having my PlayStation in rest mode constantly
I have this issue and it drives me up the wall. I can't work out why or what is causing it either. Sometimes just randomly it's like sorry you gotta download half the game again.
"Dude you're not the only one. It's happened to me multiple times as well, not every other day but every couple of weeks. AAA game..."
Is it saying buy mw to play the full game. Cuz that what its saying to me and I've got the full game on disk
"It wasn't for me no, I also have the disk."
"Ughhh i hate when this happens. Last time it started working after several reboots. I�m so done with COD, bugs, lag, cheaters, campers. can�t wait for BF6 to come out"
I am having the same problem where my guns don�t gain XP.
Dude same it sucks
"Im on PS5 and I can't play Modern Warfare and I can barely play Cold War :( Modern Warfare just keeps crashing, I'll join a game and then as soon as it starts the whole game crashes. On Cold War I can play one game but then the next game everyone will be invisible unless I restart the game after every match."
"I saw this and played a game (had update, PC), got awarded 73 weapon xp post game. Was put in a game late and got 5-7 FAL kills. Have over 80 logged on camp challenge and its level 4, had roughly that amount before i randomly got awarded enough weapon xp to unlock camo challenges though."
"Yea i felt that. Unlocked the AMAX, had a game of Shoothouse Dom HC, dropped 28 kills....AMAX: Nah imma stay at Level 1"
This is great! Good job
"When picking a weapon for your loadout there will be a ""store"" next to it. Sometimes you access packs this way when they aren't in the store menu."
Yeah I checked and it�s not there :(
"I�d kill for the saw bundle I�ve been waiting since Halloween, I�ve had the dr one in my store for the longest time not a fan. But I hope the saw bundle returns soon."
If a friend has it they can gift it to you through the app.
the no scope made me feel good down there

"Faxx,
I didn't even use a 725 and shield to upset anyone"
Downvoted for using overkill
I still think MW is one of the best looking games to this day.... It's graphics were far ahead of its time imo
"May be just you but I thought it looked awesome a lot of the time, every game w have some graphic issue here and there. But I think CW looks far more inferior"
COD can suck my plums.
Great play! Love the self-designation
"Lol I tried to post a video of Warzone here and it was immediately rejected. Why did this get 
approved? Nice clutch on your end with the 200 IQ play but I'm about to delete Reddit. Literally just downloaded it and couldn't post my video of Warzone then see a video of Warzone. Wack."
"Wrong sub buddy, this is Warzone not MW. Also you're using a Cold War gun, so it would be better suited there."
I mean I get that but you do have to launch Modern Warfare to play Warzone so pretty much one in the same
Great play and video but it more belongs on the warzone sub
"Dude no-scoped you unintentionally, what a legend"
God tier. He finished the game one and seven
Now that�s lucky LOL
"I apologized, added him and sent him the clip"
"The luckiest, or most unlucky?"
No weapon xp on eliminations :/ Hope they fix this bs soon
True.
Its really annoying tbh. A small bug like this makes the game really unplayable
What did I just witness?
I couldn�t even focus for the next two games
"I had a similar thing happen to me on sawmill, dude had a SPR on A rock watching mid from offense and missed my friend and shot me through like 3 wooden walls half way across the map"
Bullet must have gone between his legs
Bullet just had different plans
"Insane...unintentionally shot by Gomer Pile hundred of yards away, through multiple walls."
What in the actual fuck did I just see? One shot to a million.
TASK FAILED SUCCESSFULLY
No fucking way lol
"I love how you called hacks, but instantly walked it back when you saw the footage. Good man."
That is some crazy ish right there
Anyone else having that issue where your XP isn�t popping up when you get a kill?
"yes, it's been an issue ever since the last update I believe and they still haven't fixed it yet."
what are the fucking odds
Billions to one!
Hearing your utter shock and disbelief made this my favorite cod clip
Why is the xp not showing up when you kill?
Glitches since update
That is the luckiest and most unlucky thing I've ever seen!
"This is some r/nevertellmetheodds shit right here. Took me a minute to realize what happened, lmao."
Makes me think of that clip a while back of the guy who randomly shot the ATM on Piccadilly and hit the guy who happened to be on the other side.
Task failed successfully
"I feel like we�ve all done this at least once without realizing, it�s happened to me several times on several cod�s and honestly.... I love it lol 

One time in MW3 I accidentally shot my pistol and killed someone across the map (in core), and most recently I got wall banged across Piccadilly through a wall the second I spawned by accident"
god i love that ironsight
Erm... it looks like his aimbot aimed at you instead of the guy in the window.
He should play the lottery. The odds on that type of shot must astronomical
Oof
That bullet was built different
So technically he wasn�t hacking and it was just luck?
Yes
Ahhh yes my usual death on COD since mw2. Cod4 was my peak
"Crazy huh? Fate. This game blows my mind on the whole fate thing. 

Looking left when hes right. 

Its like the movie Butterfly Effect and every movie that focuses on single decisions that lead to change."
Stray bullet problem. Art imitates life.
"Similar happened to me on Superstore. I was behind those big wood boxes near one of the spawns and I was on the right side, completely hidden from the other side . walking towards the mid of the map. and I get killed from the other side by a sniper who was aiming at someone else and missed and got me instead."
Id delete my entire console actually
I literally sat in silence the next round
Back in my day when you got an insane clip you had to go one word of mouth and prayed your homies believed it. Shit like this is amazing to have recorded and makes me wish I was able of recording my gameplay years ago
Mission failed successfully
copy cat
"Lol, when I saw bullets come out of a building as long as I had an lmg or sniper I was lighting that building up. I got called a hacker a lot but after you play the game enough you can guess and let the penetration and stopping power perks do the rest of the work for ya."
Looks like some R6 Siege wall bang shit right there
your the most unlucky man ever LMAO
When you unlucky and lucky at the same time
Nani?
Imagine the emotions he went through to know a point blank target was a miss but managed to still blast some poor soul (you) through a whole ass wall.
He has that gang member aim.
Thank you for the awards!
I can't see what happened
is that mwr?
Yes
I think I'd uninstall the game if I died like that
Wanted to

No way people actually use the Rytec!?
Rytec is gas
He wasn't aiming for him...
"Yall call anyone who wallbangs you a hacker before you even think twice. I wouldnt have been surprised if he had aimed & intended to shoot there, its the most predictable corner youd be in after killing his teammate."
Honestly it's hard to shake the stigma people have when it comes to pc. Other games with cross play people act like everyone who's a God has to be on pc (they act like they've never been ruined by God's on consoles lol) but a lot have come out and said that they were wrong about that but this extends to the hacking thing too. It's always a wtf moment and the first thought is hacks. Even without this the first thought shouldn't immediately be hacking anyway lol
noobs even do this in csgo when you wallbang common spots while they're making noise lmao.
"Match just started and I killed two people on A. Everyone else was routing to B. I don�t camp, Just reloaded before flanking."
Got VR yesterday. Dont care about this anymore
"Woooo, nice shots dude"
I used to hate Riot shield users but at this point i dont care. If youre able to kill me with a shield then i shouldnt have let you get that close.
"I used to run into a lot of riot shield users. I simply equipped thermite AND the underbarrel thermite launcher and to take out both the rookies and the crazy experienced ones too.

If I get smacked with the shield or die from a knife it's my fault for letting you get that close, or not checking my 6 and getting snuck up on. 

Not going to lie, it's sure as hell made me REALLY start paying attention to my surroundings in game."
"I never thought of using the under barrel launcher, no ones ever done that to me before, I bet it�s super effective!"
"Don't worry about the comments. As someone who recently spent a painful amount of time unlocking the gold camo, I can safely say that the riot shield has plenty of effective counters.

Frankly, when actually used as a weapon, the shield is utter garbage to point of being comedic. I guess most of the hate for me was to do with the pathetic playstyle I was forced to adopt to grind out the ""Skulls"" camos."
Yeah man just do whatever you want with the riot shield. People complaining about a riot shield killing them are just angry that they died. The only annoying players to me are the ones that run a riot shield solely on the back with a 725 or mp5...but there are always counters to each gameplay style.
"Honestly I think riot shield And knife is a way to play, but if YOU USE A SMG AND A RIOT SHIELD that menas You are hot garage."
Also you can run and then jump un front of then so you can shoot above the riot shield. I did it and people did this to me.
"Yes! The good players dominated me that way, like I said it only works directly in front of you. You can shoot peoples feet out or if they crouch down then you can jump up. Or slide past on the sides"
If you're in a situation where you missed with your lethal and the shield user is getting closer you can use a stin and run around to execute them... god what have I done
I think it�s as stupid as the juggernaut. But I have squad mates that use it and find it hilarious how mad they get people.
"If people are trying kills with the riot shield, I walk up to them and let them kill me. I know it�s difficult so I try to help them"
Forget all that etiquette BS. Play the game as you choose. Get sick of hearing people whining about the riot shield or my favorite....725. Babies need to get over what other people use for loadouts.
"its always the people who use the most cancer classes that say things like this. maybe if you understand how toxic you are by using this loadouts, you will stop using them"
"all of those are annoying, but if it is for camos, then it is ok, buti have seen guys running obsidian/plat riot shields and using stuns, claymores while sitting in corners playing very defensively. those guys are scum"
"Na that�s a dumb way to play, I was trying to aggressively get in close and eff them up. Sometimes throwing knifes for a bit of ranger."
"As a riot shielder i can confirm that there is many way to countering shield, but after get a lot experience i learned to must expect that people have always semtex or thermite and i've to move every direction until they have no more something to throw.
Stupid peoples with 0 IQ just wait that i come at short range to be sure to hit me with semtex/thermite, if at mid range im already throwing stun to execute your ass why you think that i've to come so close to you? To hit you with the shield when if im already got too close to you i can easly switch to my melee weapon and kill you quickly?
Other mistakes peoples make are turn their back and run away from me (lol do this and you just gave me a free execution, remember: before you think to turn around and run riot shielder are already going to stun you) instead of keeping me far from them or dont take highgrounds

Ps: push straight a shielder to slip and shot him in the side it's not a smart move if he isn't totally dumb or inexperienced"
Fuck you and challenge idfc I�ll load up the thermite launcher for garbage like you
Lmaooo i just pop a semtex and carry on
You�d think with an issue this problematic the developers would make it a priority
Right? Like what is the point of a cross progression system if you can only progress in one game lmao � we can update our store daily with new bundles but sadly we don�t give two shits about fixing the Xp system or gun system so you can rank up we do thank you for buying the newest battle pass tho�
Wtf did it fix then?
"I believe it fixed issues with Scopes that werent showing the reticle, issues with no hitmarkers appearing in both MW  and Warzone, Operator issues etc."
Year 2 support in Modern Warfare (2019) is leagues worse than previous Call of Duties.
Wish they treated it like BO3
Well that sucks
"Rank XP is still broken too. You can only gain XP if you complete challenges.

Speaking of challenges, I think some of my Warzone Daily Challenges are bugged."
Not enough people are talking about the no rank xp
"Thanks for the update, it seems we just have to rely on word of mouth for patch notes now, seeing as all their channels are pretty much dead."
Spent two whole hours earlier grinding an MK2 Carbine before I realized I wasn't getting any weapon XP. Feels bad.

Unfortunately you are locked out as they are releasing only cold war ops essentially
Seems kind of silly. I'd happily buy CoD points to get a bundle if they were available. You'd think the money-machine that is Activision Blizzard would be happy to take my cash...
You will be able to get season one items soon in the vault packs there releasing
"Farah, Price and Nikolai as far as I know were only unlockable with the BP, I don�t think as of right now there are no current or future bundles with them :/"
"Sorry for the bad quality video! But I�m pretty sure I shot a sticky or something out of the air and I needed to share! I didn�t know that could happen, great mechanics in modern warfare!"
most guns take 2-5 shots to kill not half a mag.... also most shots below the waist with a sniper wont be a 1 shot
"Still pretty nuts when a guy can just sit in one spot and pop off a whole team pretty quick with 1 shots.
If camping and being protected"
"That�s why most snipers are a one-shot kill only to the head or the torso; snipers just generally aim for those areas. While Snipers have the advantage at long range, your gun has the advantage over them at closer ranges, which creates a balance. If they made sniping more difficult nobody would snipe, making it an essentially useless part of the game. Yes, that sniper picked you off from across the map, but that�s why you can respawn: to flank and attack the sniper at a range where the advantage is in your favor."
"People still use snipers in CW, where they are less lethal than the marksman rifles in MW. They also have Rytec level ADS speeds (the M82 is Rytec with ADS slowing attachments, the other two are Rytec with ADS increasing attachments). Then again MW has faster TTK than CW so that explains why the snipers still see use despite being harder to use."
"Ive been snipeshotted quicker at face to face than a shotty or any otherhipfire gun. So either way if someone is a good sniper they will destroy everyone. 
Like maybe they shouldn't have such a quick to aim shot. Pretty insane how quick people can reload and then shoot again"
"I'm hardly an expert sniper, but after spending some long, painful hours trying to grind out gold camos on snipers, here are my thoughts:

Snipers generally seemed a bit useless on anything except Ground War or WZ. The kinds of ranges you typically engage at in MP are best suited to SMG and ARs. Also, because the respawn times in CoD are so quick, trying to camp in one spot tends to earn you a swift death most of the time.

At close range, I found the ADS to be painfully slow. Most of the time, if an enemy came round the corner, the TTK on their gun was quick enough to melt me before I could even finish the ADS animation.

In the right hands, sure, they are lethal, but that kind of applies to anything."
"Yeah for sure, but a good sniper/marksman will beat anyother player just for the fact they can 1shot from basically any side of the map.
Also im just talking multiplayer since wz still takes at least two"
hackney yard is such a nice looking map for a wallpaper
Its a great map. Some of my favourite map in the entire series
I made some wallpapers hope you enjoy :)
"Uzi has some great looking blueprints, but I can't bring myself to take obsidian off of it after all the pain it was to get it."
I'm still contemplating whether to get platinum or not lol
When did you get the bundle?
I'd say like 3-4 weeks ago
Great images
>doesn't inspect it
"[https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lh6zl0/akira\_uzi\_inspect/](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lh6zl0/akira_uzi_inspect/) Here you go, I really wanted to but the hud shows up and ruins the wallpaper imo"
That domino skin is sick too
"imo the canyonlands (https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/db/loot/778-canyonlands) lookd better. and if you equip mastery camos, it only covers the red part. theres just something about simple camos i really like them."
Seconded
"it's a visual bug. all these missions appeared with the thursday update, and you can't do them. unless you bought a bundle or have missions left over from an MW battlepass you bought, there are no new real MW missions"
"It is a glitch that came from the update last Thursday/Friday, hopefully they fix this in another update tomorrow"
i feel like 1 week time is enough to undo the damage THEY did with their update. they better have this fix tomorrow
Thank you
Why do you say tomorrow? Was there news of another update? Or just assuming cuz it's the end of the week? Just curious

So you locked onto the helicopter but got a sick spawn kill?
Yea! Didn't know it was possible until now.
"It tried chasing the chopper, but it despawned, causing the rocket to head back to the closest in-map location, which happened to be where someone was at the moment. If you watch the sky, you can see it curve back in-bounds"
Holy shit it gives you direct access to spawn. Great way to hit AFKs or guys still adjusting their class
I have played an unhealthy amount of modern warfare but I had no idea you could do this!
I�ll see this on the top!
That's a really smart play
Sick play!
Imagine if this game had theater mode this wouldve been sick to watch. Still wish they would add it.
"When running the JOKR and a Private Radar comes up, I'll try to target it with two missiles and very frequently the second will get the owner."
Does it count as taking down an aireal vehicle?
"They didn't take out the heli, they locked onto *where the heli was*, which dropped the missile right into the enemy spawn."
I've always wondered that everytime I see them flying away. I daydream of sniping the pilot and the chopper crashing on the entire opposing team.
Duly noted
this is NOT okay
LMAO. Helicopter dissapeared and you got a spawn kill
On the Quarry ground war map you can lock onto the tanks as they drop from the sky too. Had some tasty multi kills when they sit on the first objective.
"It is a glitch that came in the update last thursday/Friday, hopefully they fix this tomorrow"
"oh ok, do you think ill get the xp back when they fix it or nah"
Exact same thing happening to me got the final kill related skin and I'm only level 4 or so kinda ridiculous that they are letting this bug exist for so long
Just some ridiculous glitch to hit mw same thing happened to me
Uninstall and reinstall the game 3 times and it will be fixed. Youre welcome.
I don't know if I would consider a 15v1 a clutch
shut up gabe itch
I... didn�t know that was an option lol
When a jug goes down in Infected you can grab the mini gun.
Budget doom slayer
Back out of 30 MP matches in a row at exactly 38 seconds and the glitch is fixed. Youre welcome.
"i did this and it worked, thanks!"
whoa what??
It's a great bug that was introduced last update :)
Me too man
I got every gun damascus feels safe man.  This is why I kept telling ppl do not pay full price for this game a year into it.  Single player has to be played online and progress doesn't save when the server constantly DC you.  But I dont think anyone would anticipated the game would straight up take MP progress away from players.  Such a raw deal for many players.
It doesn�t remove progress if you dc.
Not the only one... I had like 300 kils with the amax ( just unlocked it ) and i still am on 411 xp on level 1
"I believe the discussion went something like:

""Let's make vehicles so good that they are broken""

""Yeah OK"""
"Idiot here 



The fuck does 3pp mean"
3rd Person Perspective
"3rd person view (versus 1st person view). Basically means that when you are in your vehicle, your view switches to the kind've overhead / slightly behind you."
Next season probs - 2 weeks time
That's infuriating I don't even have spec ops installed anymore
You can kinda use it in MP from the weapon drop field upgrade
The guy on Rust that came up right behind you with the 725 and MISSED BOTH SHOTS.... WHILE YOU WERE SITTING STILL. Bad day for him lol
It made me laugh
That was me. Not really but might as well have been.
Been there many a time
"Nah, it seemed like the riot shield messed with the hit detection, I remember when that was a serious issues people talked about but slowly it was forgotten"
what attachments are you running?
"Mono suppressor, zodiac barrel, commando, stippled, skeleton stock. This allows me to run knife secondary and be viable at all ranges."
blatant no recoil cheating
Lmao what? The amax has very minimal recoil
It doesn�t. You�d still have ghost
"Cool - thanks for the verification. On some levels I sort've feel like this is an exploit, but I will take it anyway."
"Yeah me and my buddy realized overkill was kind of useless on warzone since you already have a gun by the time you get your loadout drop, then just switch out your secondary with something you were already carrying"
Lmao.  Yea please come at me with that blue milano
"Yea, that's why I was wondering about this in the first place. What is the use having that overkill perk if you can easily pick up that second weapon.."
"People reporting that the bugs are fixed. 

Just played a few games and so far I have used my guns with absolutely ZERO XP gained. Frustrating as hell."
"Yup, same."
Same also had my game crash twice. It's really frustrating.
"Same here, 3 kills without dying won't unlock and its the last thing i need for platinum ARs"
"just finished 2 matches, didn't receive any exp at all"
Same with my friend. His scope did get fixed tho. It wasn't working before. He also is saying that the spawns are a little laggy
I wonder if Activision moved most of the team to the next title and that's why all these issues are taking forever to fix.
"Just now all my bugs have dissapeared. I have hitmarkers again, i earn weapon/rank xp as normal and operator missions and blue print challenges track perfectly."
"Really? I just downloaded the patch as well. Same problem still for me, unfortunately. No xp for MP"
Lucky you...just tried and still not fixed...smh
"Oh I hope it's fixed!! I just started playing MW a couple weeks ago and was loving it then this shit happens. I'm at level 24, I desperately need to level up and unlock more weapons."
Still no hit markers most of the time for me
For real??
lucky! did you do anything to make that happen?
Did a patch come out today? I never got one.
I came here for answers and if this is true I thank you greatly
"They got your $60. They got your money from DLC, skins, BP, etc. They don�t care about you anymore. Don�t be surprised."
Didn't they say they are looking into the exp thing? I think I saw a tweet or something
"Well, in my opinion levelling and overall progress, getting XP, getting attachments is so important part of the game, that there should be a HOT FIX right after the bug appear. The same with DEV errors, it�s unacceptable.."
I just want shoot the ship or shipment 24/7 to be a permanent mode tbf but I feel all of you man
There should at the very least compensation to the players about this
they're too busy making skins
They've literally just patched it.
Just tried on PS4 and same issues...which system are you on?
"I and plenty of others are reporting zero weapon XP **after** the patch, still.

So no, they haven't.

EDIT: I'm going to go ahead and add, albeit I'm venting due to frustration, you say ""They've literally just patched it"" as if that's any form of consolation. It's an XP bug. If you **truly cannot** fix it quickly, then revert your patch to the previous version until it **can** be fixed.

Don't just let your game be broken for a full week. It does not take a multi-billion dollar company a week to fix a bug that an indie studio could've fixed in a single day. I'm sorry. And this is not taking into account that no, they **did not fix it.**"
They�ve been like this for forever. They never gave a fuck about fixing spawns and fixing the potg
No one seems to talk about the weird sight bug where the glare stays on middle of screen and the crosshair disappears. Also can't split screen without it crashing to dashboard.
Fuck them. It's free for all
I have to admit I had a lot of fun just using the melee weapons and throwing knives. But I could have won a few rounds if I used the pistol. I'll probably just do it going forward lol
Nah go for it
Normally the clips people post are just whatever but this was awesome lol. Like a movie
Thanks man. I'm proud of this one
I got Hardcore Henry vibes from this.
What mode is this?
All or Nothing! Idk if it's still in the game rn
"it's a visual bug. all these missions appeared with the thursday update, and you can't do them. unless you bought a bundle or have missions left over from an MW battlepass you bought, there are no new real MW missions"
"If you asked last week i would have said yes. But yhe last patch introduced a bug where you can't get gun XP, which means if you buy the game you will be running around with level 1 guns until they fix the game. No attachments, which make 100% of the difference between a crappy gun and a god tier gun. And we have no word from the devs for the past week. So check out yhis sub and when you stop seeing ""I can't lvl up my guns"" in new posts. I would say yes absolutely buy the game. That said it seems like the support for that game is all gone in favor of cold war. It's really sad."
"Hey, don't forget that they are still focusing on their favorite children, Warzone and Mobile."
It�s worth full price even now nearly a year and a half after release 100% I still play it every 3 or 4 days
Not unless they fix all the issues with the new patch IMHO
Nah find another FPS where the company actually gives a fuck about their player base would be my advise at the moment. Had you asked a year ago I would say yes but not now.
"It's worth it (it's worth even the full price), though there are *some* issues with the latest patch that dropped late last week and we are still waiting for them to unfuck the situation. But hey, those don't matter when you play VS AI, which is a great way of learning your way around the maps and try out the different weapons before dedicating time to leveling them up (also I find it a nice way to unwind to just put myself against 2-3 veteran bots and see how I fare with some random gun)"
It�s a fun casual game that can be very sweaty because of the match making system. If you�ve played other modern warfare games before think that but sweatier and with a better engine. I have a lot of fun playing with friends but get ready to have people playing like their life depends on it for no reason sometimes.
No. The gunplay and the movement is fantastic. But everything just makes it not worth it
"no, I bought the game aboht 6 months ago which was a good time to buy it buttttt since cold war is out they�ve reduced modern to legit a basic shitty video game. it�s good if you�ve already paid for it but i wohldnt recommend spending money on it now"
It was already a basic videos game before CW. It's a  COD game for God's sake.
what platform
What's the Copying add-on glitch
Basically you can�t install the game
For me this happened when I'm pretty sure I was installing a data pack for survival. I resolved the issue by removing the game from your downloads then install it
"Having this problem right now,"
I remember a YouTube vid of an American kid borrowing his friends disc to re install. I had to do this last time. And I now have to do it again... stupid POS game
">Could I just leave everything that I have installed as is

You should be able to. I've done the same thing in the past with different games this shouldn't be any different. The disc is just the drm that allows you to play the game. The digital stuff I do not know."

"someone got clapped

its kind of a second nature"
">This doesn't make me angry

Okay, Champ."
"Clearly it made you angry, though, sorry to hurt your feelings. You do look cool when you drop shot! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!"
So you�re not mad but you call them 35 year old virgins. You�re playing video games too dude.  Nobody thinks their cool while playing video games. It�s literally habit for some people to drop shot. Just like some people jump while shooting. But yeah. Looks like all you do is bitch about the game. Maybe you need a break.
"You seem pretty butthurt about someone calling out a useless tactic, maybe you need to take a break from social media."
Whilst it seems kinda pointless drop shotting from behind imo they might be ducking in case a frisbee spawns.
"AT mines? Yeah, that could definitely be it, but there are some people who do that every single kill. Watched my teammate do it the entire round once. It was hilarious when he would try it at longer ranges and end up missing."
Some people have modded controllers so it just auto drops every time you shoot. Seen it lots.
Thats what I've always put it down to when someone dropshots in every single situation.
It's automatic or kinda like a reflex. If you use a scuf and drop shot often you tend to do it in 'gunfights' even if sometimes unnecessary.
"That makes sense. Although, I guarantee you that a lot of people think it makes them look cool. The thing that sparked this was following a drop shotter around an entire match and watching him try to drop shot at longer ranges."
">IMO, people who drop-shot look like 35 y/o virgins who have never talked to a woman and are still living in their parent's basement  
>  
>This doesn't make me angry

Yes"
"If I switch to tactical layout on my controller, I often inadvertently drop-shot as I have a habit of spasmodically pressing my right thumb down when I shoot. It�s probably an age thing."
"I feel this way about bunnyhoppers.

But really most people who drop shoot are using modified controllers that they bought with their dad's credit card, so they can't even help it."
"B-hopping is also a viable strategy and probably more effective than dropshotting tho. 

Also idk what percent of the community really play on modded controllers or scufs but on PC dropshotting and b-hopping are both really really easy, you can bind prone to shift or a mouse button and same with jump you can set it to a mouse button."
This is the post of someone who got their shit pushed in for an entire match by a dropshotter lmao
lmao
You sound incredibly angry and insecure. You need to take a time out I think and maybe have yourself a juice box and a cookie.
"Yeah, I don't think I'm the insecure one here"
This has to be a copy pasta
"Yep, you got it"
This man saying �I�ve never lost a fight to a dropshotter� like he knows and recalls every single death he�s had in the game lmfao
"Sorry, I forget that the CoD community takes everything at face value. Nuance is lost on the drop shotting community. My bad, I'll be insanely literal from now on."
waaaaa waaaaaaa i died to dropshotters. now im gonna call them 35 year old virgins and pretend im not mad.
"I've only ever died to drop-shotters who drop shotted me in the back, also, I know how to drop shot, it's incredibly easy, so if I had a problem with it, I would just drop shot back."
"In WZ, it barely makes sense, but it at least makes some, but in MP? I don�t get it. Do people think it looks cool to drop-shot? I don�t even think it looks cool when they�re right in front of you, not to mention, it�s not tactically viable at all, all it does is make you head an easier target for anyone who�s even barely capable of tracking. IMO, people who drop-shot look like 35 y/o virgins who have never talked to a woman and are still living in their parents basement, anyone who drop-shots someone in the back can add 10 years to that. This doesn�t make me angry, I just find it ridiculously stupid and just sweaty for the sake for being sweaty. I�m not tryna get people to stop, but I do wanna know what the thought process is, and do you think it looks cool? Also, does anyone who sees a drop-shotter think it�s cool?"
"It can be habit for some players to drop shot after wide peeking corners, or slide canceling a corner into a dropshot. I do see some players do completely unnecessary dropshots though which I do find questionable.

It's a viable tactic, might as well take advantage of it. You're not doing yourself any favours or standing on some moral high ground by not doing it."
"If it were an OP tactic, then I'd have some moral high ground to stand on by not doing it, since it's not an OP tactic, there's no moral high ground for me to stand on. I don't know, maybe most players do have bad aim in this game, so maybe it is viable, I haven't drop shotted since Ghosts came out."
None
No the xp problem is still there
THAT one is so lame.  Just hoping they'll get their shit together soon.
"i Just turned on my pc and [battle.net](https://battle.net) did an update for COD of around 300MB, any news about it?"
same not yet that I know of. When I can play I will update you.
"Nothing is fixed. Hitmarkers are broken, crosshairs bug out after tac sprinting, and xp is miniscule to none for most players"
Any experience with BF? Looking for an alternative to COD. Thanks!
"Some are reporting fewer issues, but I haven't noticed a change. Everything is still buggy as hell for me"
"FYI  I was working on leveling up pistols (Shoot the Ship was soooo good) and been stuck on level 29 since this bug\_date, just hit level 31!!!!   Yep the XP is still broken and hit markers, not sure about the reticule but I finally leveled up at least 2 points!!  still have to see if the leveling is really working or go up one level when I should be going up 3 or 4."
"Did I just see lag, heavy rush, molotov, riot shield, and a rpg"
I could feel your pain through the screen
jesus that was chaotic
"By the look of it, your teammates deserted you, you went against a molotov, then lag, then the asshat with the shield (seriously, fuck people who use shield in SnD, cunts), then a stun and an RPG one by one with no teammate in sight. Understanable."
Only time a shield is justifiable is on suldal on the containers side when you have to push up between 2 choke points to plant. Hate that map for SnD.
shouldve ragequit before they got the kill lol
"Wait...

Did you just rage quit after getting owned at the beginning of the match?

And then post a video of it on social media?

Also name your damn loadouts."
I agree to all except who cares about loadout names
Not glitch you can only use it with your blueprint
"If you got 2 blueprints you can only use it or the other, without interchanging its elements. 

Access to actual attachments is earned by unlocking the base gun first and than leveling it up to achieve the actual unlock. You will then be able to switch an attachment in a blueprint for whatever other you have unlocked for the base gun."
Ok thanks. They must have changed it because back when it was first introduced I remember being able to use attachments i dont have using random blueprints. Thanks for the clarification!
"Yah you gotta actually unlock it first, than the blueprint version is usable on different setups"
Like someone said you need to have the weapon unlocked before you can swap attachments from blueprints. Or have those attachment unlocked for the base weapon.
Still haven't fixed it. Nothing has been since update. Don't buy shit from the store. F this company.
A fix is on the way stop Being a baby
Yup but I'm not getting any xp for matches.
Same ive gotten 0 rank xp since friday
Only getting xp on Warzone
Same here! Has anyone found a fix?
Plunder that's it I'm finally going for Damascus and unfortunately I never used the root shield or the shotgus so I have to level them up somehow and that's the only thing that I've found works
I am starting to think that this is done by Activision to get people to play BOCW
"I get why people are saying that, but that's not the reason. They just don't care about MW customers and are preserving code work on Warzone and CW. 

They'll get around to fixing it, but it's not some evil strategy to increase ColdWar sales.

My advice: play plunder or just enjoy whatever weapons you have already leveled in Multiplayer, BUT DO NOT BUY COLD WAR AND DO NOT SPEND MONEY IN THE STORE.

There's also been a decent uptick in redditors who have been spamming Activision's support on twitter. So there's that."
My weapons are not leveling up
Everything broke with the last update. No weapon xp
"the worst 60euro ! 1 week now i have that problem ! I bought this game 1 mounth ago and i crying my money ! the dont care about people problems(bugs crash) they pop up updates with no reason ! since the cold war shit update my pc is crashing inside the game , alot of bugs ... I dont know what they think... 200gb game useless..."
Been unable to level up my cross bow in the last 2 days but my sticks get level up every match wtf. Any solutions?
"Most of the good guns come from Modern Warfare. If this bug had affected only Cold War, nobody would�ve cared."
 COD MW (XBOX) no weapon XP &  no progress in operators missions
"Welcome to day 7 of has IW fixed the xp, let's check. The results say........ no, bummer"
Tbh I'm just checking since I have a few guns left to grind for Damascus but I'm still playing for fun with friends. Hope they fix it soon
Sorry for the bad pic
"Yes I noticed this in multiplayer, Its took me literally 40 games and I still haven't moved up a level. Am playing with a buddy and he ain't leveling up at all!  Been like this since that big update the other day. Someone said reset the game and it should fix it..haven't tried it yet. I will not go any further than restarting the game, game takes so long to download. Ill just wait for the update to fix it. Also haven't seen anything as far as infinity ward acknowledging the bug..."
"I deleted and re downloaded the game, it did nothing for weapon xp"
At this point its not a bug. Its them intentionally making everyone progress slower. You think they literally have a job in making certain things like this for 10+ years and they out of nowhere fuck it up? This shits on purpose. Anything to get people to spend money on the game.
"For me the only guns affected by the xp bug were the amax ,m4a1 and iso"
Is this happening in multiplayer or to specific players as i don't see many people posting about this?
A fuck ton of people are posting about same for people who�ve had the fix actually fix their game too.
Know bug
I�m with you on that it shouldn�t take this long but you don�t have to play cross platform..you do know you can disable that right?
You can only disable it on Playstation not Xbox. I know sounds stupid but its true.
"Hitmarkers have been showing inconsistently on PC, too. Not a console only issue.

Aside from that, what's wrong with playing with crossplay? I've been finding good console players who can stand their ground very well since day one and to be honest I see console players with nuke emblem much more than PC players with it."
Try the m13
M4 is awesome. It I think a lot of ppl use the killo to honestly I use the m4 you got for preordering the game I like the set up on it
I�d try the grau
Kilo is still good. FFAR and Groza shred. The FFAR is good to maybe 30-40m and the Groza is pretty good out to 60-70. Kilo still beams out to 100m.
I�ve given in to the mac10 meta it�s honestly the only gun that I see
"But it doesn't have the range I'm looking for and I am absolutely trash with a sniper rifle plus I don't like sitting still I prefer close/mid range 
Also are the attachments I have unlocked only for the xm4 or do they carry over to other similar guns. 
Sorry for the dumb questions but I never played cod before this last week or any other fps for that matter"
[deleted]
I will have to check when I get home in about 2 hours I don't remember off top I will get back to you about that
I�m trying out the amax.
It is a glitch and developers are aware of..so hopefully they fix it soon
they're having alot of issues lately its insane
Sad but true
"Multiple people are posting the same issue as there are numerous bugs since the last update.  Submit a bug report https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-feedback-and-bug-reporting

In the meantime you can get experience in co-op special ops."
"oh ok, thats weird  
thank you for the info though!"
"""How much time was left?""

""You don't wanna know."""
If only people could see the point of the post and not complain about the .725. Great post.
downvoted - 725 user.
Overkill 725.
"Okay, but why is the bomb in a case for a relatively old single tube NVG goggles?"
You immediately lost all reason to showcase this the moment the 725 was selected
"While I�m at it, fuck the new category tab highlighter."
"Yeah but then you also have those dudes that chuck a frag across the map at the beginning of the round and it blows up in your face, mid-air, with absolutely no warning."
This tactic goes all the way back to Cod4.  Good ol' Random grenading
I�ve done that with semtexes plenty of times
And don�t forget about the noob tube spamming at the start of rounds as well
I always just leave and re-join whenever this happens.
"Side note, why do my explosives do more damage to myself than enemies?"
EOD
I have blown myself up with frags bouncing back at me more times than I can count. It�s also especially embarrassing when you�re playing hardcore and you blow some teammates up along with you
It's annoying when said teammates walk right in front of you as your throwing the grenade
"Frags are great, you just need to make the wall-bounce effect your ally instead of your enemy.

They're great in HQ and Hardpoint as you can hang back in safety and bank the nade off the wall into the HQ."
Exactly. If you can bounce one off of the inside of a doorway just right you can get some pretty nice camper kills
That was hilarious
Next time don't throw the bouncy ball straight at the flat wall lol
The moment i heard the loud ping sound i had an ominous feeling but thought to myself how can that grenade possibly do a complete 180 bounce and come back at me?
"Frags are superior tho IMO being able to bounce it and cook it allows for way more versatility, I usually run Semtex with my SMGs tho cuz ur moving too fast to really utilize them well, they work better with ARs and snipers and the cross maps ofc, I get a free kill at least once a game in SND with em"
There is no danger indicator for frags in hardcore right?
Right
Nope. Great way to lay a timed trap or just make people panic because they hear the sound of the nade bouncing around.
"Stickies and thermite go where you want them! And they don�t have that 6second fuse, cooking is time that could be spent shooting

But a real lethal connoisseur uses throwing knives"
Apparently frags were absolutely broken in the original Modern Warfare. Anybody played that and want to explain?
"Because everyone spawned with 2 grenades, no perk needed. Every match was a grenade spam clusterfuck due to everyone wanting to use up their 2 grenades every life."
"Sell the dog and buy MW 

/s"
I don't know why people are trashing on you for buying physical copies of the game seeing as they're just cheaper but I put mine in a cabinet or drawer that way nothing gets to them
"On top of this, I learned the hard way that digital copies take up way more space. I have the digital copy of MW and it takes up a good 200 GB of my ps4"
"If its the disk version, just buy it used"
Yea I was actually just looking at it and used is half the price...just sayin..
All the used game shops in the UK are closed due to lockdown restrictions at the minute!
"Put the discs up higher, get the dog a bone!"
is selling your dog an option?
"Don�t be too mad at the pup, they are basically just a little kid that doesn�t know better and doesn�t even speak your language."
"I'm not really that mad at him haha, it's not like he set out to do it intentionally! Just needed a little vent and thought this was the place for it"
Buy it used off someone else. But you can hold off til they fix this bloody update
"Yep, wait 'till it's fixed, it's not worth it RN."
You hate to see it.. Take it easy man
Eat pizza in front of doggo and have dead disc by your side. Don't give doggo pizza.
"With all the terrible bugs happening after the update lately, your doggy is doing you a dam favor."
Post the venmo?
"We don't have Venmo in the UK, only PayPal! Didn't wanna seem like a beggar hahaha"
I just checked and its selling for around 11� on ebay.
Shit happens
"Thanks, never thought of it that way!"
Try CW zombies and maybe get a couple months of gamepass
good thing it's currently unplayable
After this update it seems your pup has done you a favor!
I feel bad for your dog because he ate shit
Undercover agent from activision.
Wait till you your kids here...
I already have a two year old and he used to think ejecting the disks and handing them to me was doing me some kind of favour. Never had to clean so many fingerprints off of them!
"Pros and cons to having disc and not having one, sorry about your luck buddy."
Always buy a digital copy bro. I learned that lesson in a similar fashion.
no thanks. you can�t resell a digital copy
"no thanks, I actually prefer owning my games"
"In this place you'll only see people saying MW.

I didn't like MW, so I'm biased, CW easily, but from the perspective of a long time player who likes to rush without having to worry all the time."
"Very mature way of putting it. In my opinion, Cold War is much better if you like respawn gamemodes. MW is much better if you like Search and Destroy. If I liked respawn I would be on Cold War instead of Modern Warfare for sure."
"Personally, I love modern warfare. I've never really cared for the BLOPS series"
maybe ask r/callofduty so the opinions wont be biased
I want to say modern warfare so bad because Cold War is just trash; until they fix this update though the game is basically broken.
"The two games are totally different in playstyle imo, so choose the one you prefer more. Yeah the battle pass is doable on both games but you can only use 80% of the stuff in CW or warzone. CW is also the one thats mainly supported with new content rn and will be for the rest of the year. I personally prefer MW and stuck with that but there are a ton of bugs rn. If you're OK with some bugs that are gonna be fixed in the future and the occasional shitty playlists then go for MW it's a really good CoD."
"If you want to keep that ""Warzone"" vibe in a more multiplayer leaned game, then play MW. if you wanna try something similar in style but different, or zombies then go for CW."
"Modern Warfare is (IMO) the better game. Having said that, being something of a completionist, I'm not a fan of being permanently locked out of content simply due to not playing a game during a certain time.

So be aware that if you're like me, there's going to be a lot of cool stuff (though all purely cosmetic) that's no longer available to you in MW. As far as I know, this also goes for quite a few operators (I guess that counts as cosmetic too though).

Fundamentally, if all you're after is the gameplay, they are both pretty similar."
"Which cod games have you enjoyed more? That�s a starting point. I would say get both but realize that buying mw you are buying the game as is with no future content outside of speculation, or go with coldwar for more content. Gameplay is boots on the ground and slower paced limited compared to modern warfare and both are completely different games which is always the case with separate devs. Zombies is better than spec ops, but ground war is better than the shit on cw. Both have gunfight which is pretty sweet. Map wise did you enjoy treyarchs maps or IWs? Playing warzone you�ve had a taste of the different guns offered too so there�s that, but you lose the mounting mechanic that�s in wz/mw. Classes are a bit different too shotguns are not longer primary in cw which I like."
"Also shotguns are more balanced in CW, although  dual magnums are not atm"
I'd say cold war because if you don't like the multiplayer you can fall back on the campaign with slot of replay value or zombies. Cw still is getting updates while mw is basically left to rott. I personally like the mp of cw also better because it plays waaay faster then mw.
"CW is going to be more supported for the next year or so til the next cod and I feel like they did a lot of stuff right structurally but it�s still a buggy, clunky, somehow more campy game. MW is much smoother and more complete and fun in my opinion, MW has a faster ttk and more cheesy/ fun stuff you can do where as CW gives you the ability to have 6 perks so everyone is OP as shit and just camps with LMGs and hard scopes because the sniper rifles take 6 years to scope in. I might be giving it more shit than it deserves but I�m just not a fan at the moment. Zombies is fun though and the campaign is great."

It stinks your friends post got more attention than the original.
Sweet
How did you know where was the guy you wallbanged?
UAV and incredible luck
Holy shit
Very nice shot bro insane wallbang!
Thank You!
"If I saw that in-game I dunno if I'd think this is mighty sus.

On one hand you wall banged a dude like that.  
On the other hand you didn't scope in and hipfire is not accurate to do that unless you got lucky.

Of course you'd have PSN symbol in lobby, but that's easy to forget."
I just shit my pants
Is he PC?
No PS4 Pro
No way first I thought you aim bot
[deleted]
It's *My* account and *My* clip now. Thanks.
So the CDL camos that supposedly say they only work for Cold War or Warzone actually work for MW as well?
Can anyone confirm?
"Nevermind, yeah they work in mp."
That was incredible
Reminds me of 1v1s on Nuketown in BO2.
Been trying this shot for years.... nice asf!

Edit: Nice clip, great shot"
Why ain�t he getting any XP?
You haven�t heard of the amazing update yet?
Yes it happened to me on all 4 snipers.
It was like the first one I got lol
Yeah I usually finish everything before unlocking smoke camo. But I always use double xp to unlock challenges faster when grinding gold
"I tend to try to use 2xp when its up, but even with that I've never gotten smoke anywhere but first on most weapons, I got dragon earlier on the reworked melee challenges because its like 30 kills for the last challenge, but for things like smgs lmgs ars etc. its normally one of the first ones I get done with. I tend to go straight into kills with no attachments once im finished with kills with 5, and I'm normally finished with straight up kills at that point"
"As an aside, which camos did you find you mostly unlocked last? For me it was Longshots, mounted, or kills after reload for AR and SMGs."
"For me its almost always lichyard or gartersnake done last, I tend to force myself to gradually get mounted before then and longshots are more come and go things than me actually forcing myself to do it, I might build a gun differently, such as giving it a bullet conversion kit to make it better at range or have a faster cycle rate fir hipfire kills, but I mostly play hardcore so most guns are either a 1 or 2 shot kill at any range anyway, so they just come and go. I check longer sightlines on the map, but that's about it.

Kills I dont focus on ever

Headshots if I catch someone in a ""finishing move"" style situation (they havent seen me) I will try to get headshots done, but they tend to come from normal playing or hipfire mostly

Crouches are easy, never have to focus on them 

Hipfire kills are really easy in hardcore, I normally run Merc foregrips on my builds anyway so I will just put a 5wm laser on instead of a scope if im rly struggling

Longshots I said about earlier

Mounted are a chore, I have to force myself to do them, but if I see a line of sight with people nearby I will mount up and get them, but I tend to get like 1/2 a game so it takes a while to get them

Kills with 5 attatchments is easy

Double kills are mostly chance

Kills after reloading are easy, I tend to run sleight of hand on non snipers anyway so they come fairly easily

Kills with no attatchment I start to do after I finish with 5 attatchments and they just sorta happen

3 player killstreaks just sorta happen too, but due to it being unlocked at max level I normally finish it last"

"So I downloaded these base installs and I have bought the full modern warfare game but not Cold War. Then I installed these for free. What does these do? Can I play Cold War or what because I�m confused. Even when I go into COD it doesn�t show any options to play Cold War, only show I have to buy it"
"Idk if anybody told you (specs wise) but the AMR is actually pretty terrible for long range sniping.

It has the worst Bullet velocity of the 3 high-Cal snipers @ 546 m/s while the AX50 sits at 682 and the HDR @ 750. Which means it�s got the most bullet drop and requires the most lead & compensation. 

The ADS speed is also the worst in the high-Cal Sniper category @ 683ms while the AX50 & HDR sit at 596ms & 604ms 

It also has the worst range of the 3 high-cal snipers, all 3 are guaranteed 1-shot-kills to the head & Chest at any range. However the HDR can 1-shot to the stomach at infinite range, the AX50 can 1-shot to the stomach at upto 100m but they Rytec AMR can only 1-shot to the stomach at a max of 61m 

Source: TrueGameData"
"Well, I at least found it to be pretty good. What I meant when I mentioned the bullet drop was it was easy to lead the shot (making it less irritating), at least in my experience. Also, aren't there some attachments that help with range & velocity? I recently starting using it so I don't have many attachments."
i think this is satire
"tbh it doesnt matter as long as you have the sniper setup properly.

i use the spr in warzone with my setup it DOINKS people at almost any range"
"I couldn't find the proper word to describe how it looks when I hit people.

""DOINK"" will do."
no. Just no.
I think yes.
been playing this mode exclusively the last week but it looks like they just took it out today :(
Yep. New playlist are shite
They entirely broke it 6 days ago. It will eventually stop going up at all.
It's a bug from the last update. You can get weapon xp in plunder by completing contracts. Whichever weapon you have equipped when the contract is done gets the xp. At least that's what I've heard lots of other people say.
You can level it up in co-op special ops.  The update last week brought an infestation of bugs.
"Hm, thats debatable. Ive tried leveling up guns there and it didnt work"

"That�s the problem though, the �ban hammer� is banning the wrong people. I�m not really interested in their metas or whatever but I agree with them that the game shouldn�t be played until activision at least acknowledge there needs to be a decent anti cheat, not just ban them then make a new account."
Who?
"Turning off crossplay pretty much eliminates contact with cheaters. So yeah, I'm still going to play."
Soap should come within the next two weeks because it says �season one� on his bundle.
I'd hope so.
"Unfortunately that doesn't mean much.  It only indicates when the bundle was added in the game, not when it will become available.  There have been many past bundles that have released *seasons* later."
"They're not helping on Cold War nor Warzone.
Activision overlord is just silencing and preventing them from releasing new content 

They are now fully on MW2 slated for 2022 release"
is it gonna be MW2?
Thats a joke nice feed
Thanks man! I've had it SO many times that people were killing me at around \~26... Until I got it for the first time ever in Shoothouse (post is on my profile)
Why would you have hardline as your last perk? Wouldn't that be completely pointless or am I missing something?
You'll need one less kill for the Specialist bonus \^\^. That's why the Hardline
What�s your Amax load out?
"Monolithic suppressor, commando foregrip, stippled grip tape, holographic sight , exo skeleton stock"
"You wanna share that Bizon class? Just wanna test it out, I love the gun. Was my first gold gun in this game and my first obsidian gun also."
"Monolithic suppressor 

8.7"" steel barrel

stippled grip tape

Corvus Skeleton Stock

Tac Laser (Swap this out for something else if you're not playing shipment. For example sleight of hand)"
Why would you gift a bundle to someone who doesn't own the game?
The only way to gift is in the cod companion app.
Thats sad. But thanks.
You could buy it from the armoury and then gift it from the app under �my bundles� but then you have to pay twice ahah. That�s the only way though infortunately
Its really annoying that I can only gift certain blueprints through the app that are in rotation. Trying to gift my friend a gun that he has been wanting for a while through the app as a surprise but it isnt appearing.
"Nice clip dude! Love the HDR quickscopes, never thought I'd see someone pull it off that well."
yo lowkey thats sick
Damm
Why cant I get into lobbies like this. WTF!!!
Maybe you�re always in lobbies like this
"Happening for me atm with Mara specifically. I've had one other operator track a challenge, just not Mara. Super annoying, but is what it is. Especially since we're pretty mich expected to just wait and hope it fixes."
Nope you�re the only person it�s happening too! Multiple other people haven�t posted the same exact thing every hour of every day.

I can�t even open warzone (not that I�d want to anyways lol) activision is really dropping the ball lately with warzone hacks and Cold War being garbage and now MW won�t even let me play. I�m gonna go to battlefield if they don�t �git good� or just start playing old fallout games again
Yep im on PC and crashes usually by 2nd or 3rd game
I finally got it to quit crashing so often by updating the driver but it�s still being weird on occasion
System specs? Which version of Direct X are you running?
"I7 core, 1660ti And 16gb ram. Never had issues like this and idk what direct x even is tbh."

I picked up a Sykov from a dead opponent in a MW TDM match on Petrov yesterday. How did he get it?
"Probably also with a weapon drop field upgrade, since you can't equip the Sykov normally yet. (I say ""yet"" because I'm still hoping they release it already)"
"They're taking so fucking long to release these weapons! Man, I'm already tired of leveling up Cold Sweat guns for Warzone."
"I know! I just want to be able to use that MW Sykov, the Makarov is one of my favourite guns so I got excited to hear it was coming to the game. And uh... Well, it's been around a month now. At least it can be leveled up early in survival and plunder, I guess."

\#metoo no solution helps atm for me.
I hear if you buy Cold War it will stop
I can assure you it doesn't. You better have a fast ssd because there is no work around.
Lol
"Maybe in the end season 1, i belive"
Same
Honestly these probably won�t release until around the summer when the supposed mw3 remaster comes out. Especially the Soap and Sparks pack.
IW nor Activision gives a fuck about MW. CW is their cash cow.
"Even tho more players are probably playing warzone and MW, they still wanna try and kill it."
Ive been waiting for the guns for months i am currently enjoying cold war and its superior maps. Sucks i know but life goes on
"Weapon XP gain is slow or non-existent.  Reticles I can confirm still work.  Been able to unlock a few this past week.

If you want to level up a weapon go to plunder and do contract after contract or go into Co-Op."
But is this a glitch or something? Because i was leveling up guns without any issues a week or so ago. Just recently unlock amax and grau. And have amax on 40+ and grau on 30+ levels. But havent played for a while and today i tried and no xp for grau.
Same issue. Stuck at 67/200 and tried many combinations with no luck
Type 63 is a CW weapon. You have to use the Cold War Zoom scope. And weapon XP is dead.
sign up to bella thorne's onlyfans will get you the pack
"Its on the Companion app for me today, you can check that too."
"I checked but couldn�t find it, is there a way to search for a specific pack on the app?"
"Actually just bought the pack today. Took me a bit to find it but here's how to buy it

Go to multiplayer  
Hit the weapons tab  
Edit loadouts  
Hover over the Kilo(or Fr 5.56)  
Hit the little store button that pops up  
Find the Yandere(Or Kuudere for the FR)  
Click it and it should bring you to the bundle page for it  


Edit: Forgot to mention you can't find it from the warzone menu, you can only find it through the multiplayer menus in Modern warfare"
Thank you!
If you have mp it should work it's a werid thing where if your on warzone not every blueprint will show up so would need to go into the mp of each game to get all or most blueprints
Mp? Whats that
Yeah we know. Dozens of people have said it
Really? I think you�re the only one who this is affecting.
"No, look at more posts in this sub - I just did and many people have reported the same bug! Are you also playing it on PS4?"
Same problem
Were all in this together -\_-
Activision has chosen cold war as favorite game )):
You can still get xp in survival
My co-op is saying install suspended and I've got all the packs downloaded other than the graphics one cuz it said I don't need it to play mp or co-op
U still get it in Wazone
Unlocking Weapon camos still grants xp.
"Every other death I was swapping between a close quarters smg/shotgun loadout for clearing buildings and an lmg/rocket launcher loadout for killing tanks and killstreaks.

Rushed C to begin with and IMMEDIATELY got murked as soon as I slid through the door. Kept spawning, killing one dude at C, and repeating until we captured it, and then had to fight like hell to keep it.

Several enemies started holing up in the building next to C, that pyramid shaped one, so we had to try to break in there. I kept spawning, throwing in grenades and stuns, and dying repeatedly. But we eventually managed to break into that building and clear it out.

Then the enemy team tried to go for A and B next to our base, and I would run in, help clear out the main floor, and then run through the smaller buildings in between A and B to try to root out any stragglers. Prevent them from being spawn points for their squad buddies.

Very fun game, if a bit stressful. Lol"
"I think I'm wrong, but I think you have to buy MW2 Remastered to get the MW 2019 items."
"I own it, i even go to buy it in the cod store and its says i already own this"
If I remember correctly the items where only obtainable by preordering the remaster
"A few guns aren't leveling the last update broke

Weapon xp
Xp in general 
Reticals 
Hit markers

And so on"
Of course they managed to  break something in an update... I really hope it gets fixed soon

Wait till next patch to do challenges
Also weapon leveling is broken right now
Hahahahaaaaa. Yes. Take this
haha thank you man
LMFAOOOOOOOO
That song goes so well with this
Had a good laugh with this one take an award.
Song?
Ble ge ge ge ge get
Darude sandstorm
100 miles x Skinbone
amazing
10/10 to funny man
"Hilarious. I love this song. 

Also, great sniping! I'm envious."
thanks man!!
Damn what's it like to still earn XP :(
"From the bottom of my hearth, I swear to God himself. This is a work of art"
"As I mentioned yesterday, their acknowledgement isn't too relevant, it took them 2 years after their acknowledgement of the MW3 matchmaking not working on PS3/PC to fix it and 1 years and two months for Gorod Krovi.

While this shouldn't be the case, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will happen soon."
"�Hi there, thanks for reaching out! So sorry for the trouble with this. It is a known issue and studio is currently working to resolve this. If there is anything else I can help you with today, please let me know! ^CK�

That�s their response to someone specifically complaining about the XP glitch. At least it�s something yknow"
"Yeah, agreed. I've had the game since launch. It's been an issue since launch lol."
"It would have taken something like this to finally drive me away from this awesome game. Congrats Activision!

PS. I will never buy shitty Cold War."
Same. I was burned when I got the CoD 4 remaster and thought they were back on the right track with MW2019. Last CoD I had before those was BOII so it looks like it�ll be another half decade before I consider buy another one lol
At least we have confirmation it�ll be amended at some point? Or maybe you�re just not stupid and knew they would eventually fix it?
I mean it's been a problem since the game came out. That was a while ago. Wouldn't get your hopes up. It comes and goes.
"The title of this post could be misleading. They issued a canned response from a Salesforce driven social media bot which they use for most of the public twitter replies. They have provided no ETA for a fix, or even acknwledged they understand the cause of the problem. All they said was "" looking into this issue  "". Same vague response that was posted by IW's art director 5 days ago."
"Not sure how it�s misleading when I didn�t say when we might expect it, and they have said on Twitter it�s being worked on."
"Needs to hurry up this close to end of season. Granted I do most of my season pass in warzone but as I�m wanting to leveling for warzone...plunder doesn�t cut it and it took me a few games before I realised it wasn�t working. First world problem yes, but it shouldn�t be happening and take this long to fix for such a big company"
�This games dead� �they don�t care� �unsupported piece of shit� and here we go a fix as expected.
"To be fair the whole situation is a bit ridiculous so I understand people being mad, but if IW or Activision acknowledged it straight away there wouldn�t be so much (kinda justified) salt."
Doesn't mean anything.  When playlist updates and they remove GW infected with no XP then most likely they'll change the no XP ruleset for rest of the playlist.  It's a waiting game.
"Imagine if something that simple was the actual cause smh

When do the playlists usually rotate?"
Is this in regards to being unable to level up weapons? For me it�s taking longer to level up weapons on MW than it ever has.
"Yep, weapon xp is currently broken for just about everyone on MW"
Okay perfect. I thought for a minute I was going insane. Glad I got the information. Thank you sir!
Currently there is a bug that prevents you from gaining xp at all. I think the devs are working on fixing it based on their trello board
Do you have the link to the Trello board?
[deleted]
naw this shit is intentional to get people to stop playing mw cause cw is circling the drain
"Not the best time to buy MW, currently a xp bug around hopefully it'll be fixed soon"
"Yeah, I recently bought a copy to smurf on for the lols. Plunder allows you to level up but not the actual MP. Fucking sucks. Still kicking ass regardless."
"You picked a bad time to get lost friend.  


The most recent update to MW broke progession (weapon XP), broke latency, broke hit detection, and broke camos. It's rough right now, and we're all waiting for a fix."
"LMFAO. I�m sorry, truly I am. But, you should try to get a refund. The game is BROKEN. Like imagine a shitty steam game for 2 dollars broken. No weapon XP can be earned."
"""Bro, just get in the car!!"" ""Fuck no. I'll run"" -- Every WZ match I've ever played"
lmfao is this the coolest thing you've ever done? This just seems so weird to clip by itself.
Technically all kills are free. You just have to earn them ;) gj on the snipes tho
It's still broken it just levels up when ever it feels like
Its a great game but cmon what is this
Go into co-op for experience.  The bugs since the last update grant some experience here and there but it�s very random and quite low in multiplayer.  Co-op is consistent so you can level and level your weapons.
Ikr for us camo grinders it is so hardddddddddd
What he hell are you talking about?
My guess would be SBMM or the xp thing
"You can�t mention it in a post. It�s skill based matchmaking, new developments with the topic keep rolling out but the entire topic is censored on here because it�s talked about too frequently. Yet, Reddit is where at least decent discussions can take place but not when the topic is essentially restricted by an auto moderator that fails to recognize posts from a new angle."
I Didn�t Make The Game...The Game Made Me.
"Was it a new or used copy, maybe with a code? Also, the game is a MASSIVE amount of storage and when I bought the digital copy, I had so much trouble with the download.

There�s packs basically:
-Campaign pack
-Multiplayer 1,2, etc packs
-Warzone 1,2..etc packs

When you go to play does it have an ad for Cold War far left, Warzone in the middle, then Campaign/Multiplayer/Co-Op on the far right?"
"Its a used copy. I downloaded everything it said to download. On the left is cold war, warzone in the middle and on the right is modern warfare but it just says ""purchase"" like cold war does"
It gives you this problem if you had it digitally before buying a physical copy. Only way to fix it is to delete the whole game and redownload it from the disk.
"That's the thing tho, I just got this xbox and warzone wasn't downloaded until a few hours ago"
delete it and don�t buy activisions trash anymore
If you not gonna say anything helpful then don't say anything at all.
"its pretty much a global glitch that players everywhere are experiencing. Its fucking obnoxious, they need to send a fix asap ffs"
Oh snap... I didint know it was wide spread? When did it start? I only noticed it today. I swear everything was working just a couple days ago.
I have the same problem..but for some reason I managed to get 2 levels with a shotgun. I don�t know how and why but after I noticed the progress stopped for the rest of the games I played
"Yes it\`s a common bug brought in with the latest patch.   
They\`re supposedly working on it..."
"Does the OW system just promote reports for proper review by the support or does it lead to direct punishment? If it's the latter and there's a reward for the reviewed player getting punished, you can expect a *lot* of false positives."
"No, the reports are stacked. If enough reports come through as positive it�ll go through a manual review by a mod, whom then agrees or disagrees with the final decision thus banning or not."
"No. I see so many hackusations of clearly legit KBM players on Reddit that I don't trust the cod community to identify hackers. 

People think that high sensitivity mouse players are hacking because they can't tell the difference between someone flicking to a target and an actual aimbot"
"It's funny how many times you get called a hacker on Console just because you're doing well. I mostly play Hardcore, so with alright aim and decent game sense you can rack up quite a few kills, add in the AK or any other one shot gun, can easily get 50+ kills. I assume in my case people mistake my lag for cheating, I've had many suspicious POTGs which result from lag. At the end of the day, I'm a a guy with a shitty console, bad Internet, using a broken mouse or a broken controller; but people still call me a hacker."
"i would really like that, but the amount of people screaming hacks at players that are definitely not hacking would make it pretty hard to get clear results  from such a system"
"You won�t be playing competitively on a laptop, it will run fine."
yeah how can someone even think of leaving such an amazing game

What even is this comment
U good?
That pause at the end to record game clip hit different
Just as a dudes sprinting at him like fucking 117
Lol why is it marked NSFW?
Because he just single handedly fucked an entire lobby
"Both games are good, just that the one you prefer is purely a matter of taste. Lucky for me, I hit the goldilocks zone and enjoy both games equally. Both games could use some tweaking here and there though."
I thought I was the only one who enjoyed both games!
"They are both good. And both have their share of problems. Good for you though, I'm glad you have fun! I'm sort of jealous, I want to enjoy Cold War but I can't."
Nah MW is much better than Cold War
"I mean CW had a very rushed development, reusing BO4 assets, on an old engine, during a global pandemic, and was released in a sorry state, with minimal content and virtually no polish.  


Meanwhile, MW uses a new engine, all original assets, released with more content, and has a ton of polish and attention to detail. And on top of that, it's had a year of high quality of post-launch support and content. CW is using the infrastructure MW created to even exist in Warzone.  


It's genuinely hard for me to say ""it's just a matter of taste"" when the quality of both games isn't even close to the same..."
"Yeah, that �realism� feels way better and with much more quality over all, yeah the maps are campy and there�s more problems but the weapon animations and gun play feels way better."
Right? The maps in Cold War are good but too small.
"Cold War is a game that needs work, just like how Modern Warfare did for the first few months.

I think it might be a smart buying practice to buy COD titles about 6 months in from now on, considering that's when they tend to move out of the beta stage.

I hope Treyarch's next title will have a slightly modified version of MW's engine. Could you imagine Treyarch's colour palette and theme on that engine? It would smoke Modern Warfare 2019.

I think the engine is the only thing that is keeping people away from Cold War. I would much rather play Cold War on the IW engine than MW in it's current state.

A lot of players who are CW fanatics are just willing to lose the smooth mechanics in exchange for a more competitive and more arcadey experience, which is something that MW lacks. Not saying that they are wrong for that, everyone has their own taste."
"I really liked mw with the gunsmith system it was cool making different guns but the gameplay in cold war is just better in my experience (i haven't played MW since November of 2019) Modern warfare everyone camped with the ridiculous claymore range, 725's, and riot shields, campers, and more every game. Cold war feels like a cod because of it's fast-paced movement"
"Yeah, the game is not perfect. But camping is a staple in the game. The 725 is ridiculous, I agree."
"You think Cold War is slower then MW? I mean, I like Mw, but MW is slower then Cold War."
[deleted]
I'm playing cold war to bascially get dark matter and get all achievements and then just going back to mw.
Not just you man. Servers are bad tonight
possibly got shadow-banned mate :/ i got shadowbanned before and they put you in lobbies with suspected cheaters with unbearable lag and rubber banding.
Yeah it�s been bad lately played one match we�re it was just unplayable had I could shoot at people five ft in front of me some how Miss and then kill me. I�m not great by any means but usually top 4 or so points getter on either team (when I'm not grinding camos)
"Update really fucked up a lot of things.

Reinfected Ground War times out because it can't handle the load."
"Bug. There are no missions, just like there's no spoon."
"that's playstation, it makes a copy of the WHOLE game, and then it installs that. its supposed to reduce load times from fragmentation. the only thing that's infinity ward/activisions fault is the game size"
That�s why I never put blame on anybody and stated that idk whose fault it is but I�m straight up sayin I�ve got almost 100 games on my shit get updates all the time and the only one I ever have these problems with is this one
"Chill pill here for you my man, you got that patience I believe in you"
Dude when I want to play a game I want to play a game and I want to play it now which has become uncommon for me i the case of playing modern warfare but when I get that itch it�s insatiable and 9-10 times when finally decide I want to play it and touch it this is what I get and it�s ridiculous it�s out of control and every other game I have every other game I�ve ever played doesn�t even scratch the surface of time it takes for this nonsense to update install and or the space required and all I delete for it is never even needed
Sounds like someone stole your account because you got Damascus. I would start compiling evidence like game clips or screenshots to prove you are the account owner and send them with an account recovery request ASAP.
When you get it back enable 2fa
That shit is gone lol
Stupid thing was I read a post about similar happening and had started the 2fa process but kept getting an error using the Google authenticator
It sucks cause the game is slowly dying ;/
"slowly, but not as fast as you think!"
"ya 10v10 is dead, everything else is fine"
"nah, 10v10 hardcore always gets filled for me"
"I noticed the same and it also takes longer to find 10v10 games now. Plus more people have a higher ping than before (100+).

One issue might be the lack of new maps in the rotation. As an example there are a number of maps that work in TDM but IW won't add them. Also limiting 10v10 to tdm and a mosh pit of kc, dom and hq isn't helping I'm sure.

10v10 was the only reason I got MW in the first place. I never liked 6v6 in COD because I find it boring. Guess I got used to the chaos of 16v16 (and higher) in CoD4 PC."
just played 10v10 hardcore it was great until we lost
10v10 moshpit is always full for me
That laugh is infectious
Nothing fishy about that FaL at all.

https://youtu.be/85VrVOBtRzY this should be the menu song from Modern Warfare at the moment.
"Aye that�s the one mate, was trying to find out if anybody knew the name of it. Cheers anyway though bud"
Okay same. Lag finally stopped and lobbies got ridiculous
I am noticing the same thing at the moment
"This is something I can relate to, I don't consider myself the best but I am not the worst, I think sbmm is fucked because I get placed against tryhards and my teammates will be level 49?"
I am still not getting XP
Yeah something changed with the latest patch.
"No XP, no gun leveling so wtf???  promote this hashtag on twitter, insta or wherever... 

  [\#modernwarfare\_brokenbyupdate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modernwarfare_brokenbyupdate?src=hashtag_click)   get some attention from them."
"this!!! and IDK if its just me, but the hackers in ground war are out of control. Snapping on targets through walls, Aiming and following you path trough walls. Its getting boring now"
"It�s a universal issue. Activision just started looking into it, though this is one of the several bugs with the new update from days ago."
Heard thanks buddy. I just re-downloaded MW after months of not playing and was confused.
Last update fucked everything up.
Any word on a fix?
"Got the typical ""We are aware of the issue"" without anymore detail.  I hope it gets fixed, I just bought the game and have a lot of guns to max out!!"
This isn�t even a question just do it
"Need

* I don't care/show results"
Shoot the rusty ship would be mint
I haven�t played rust in like 8 months lol
I don't personnaly like it but i see why people do. It wouldn't hurt to have it permanent honestly. And with the amount of people that it would make happy I don't see why not. It's not like we have only one playlist a week. There would still be plenty of room for other stuff
"People only play this mode because they want to play shipent so they could unlock camos faster.

Just bring back shipment 24/7"
They just want people to buy cold war tbh its so annoying
"I don�t even care about camo crap, they are the only maps that are actually fun."
"I really don't care for Shipment, so I use Shoot the Ship for Shoothouse. Yeah it should be a separate Shoothouse 24/7 and Shipment 24/7"
"It's about the casualness of shoot the ship 24/7 that makes it fun. For people that aren't sniping, quick scoping champions and just want to kill people without a ton of effort, taking it away makes the mp crap. It's chaotic, fun, fast, and sweet. Just make it a permanent feature, please"
And it�s the only maps are aren�t dogshit
"They screwed up big time.

With the latest update, things gone really wrong. So many glitches and bugs showing out of nowhere. Reticles not functioning properly, unable to level up weapons because we can't earn exp for it and so forth. Poor decisions led to disappointments. What in the hell did you do? Is it because you merged with your poorly developed game called Cold War?

Thanks a lot, Activision."
I would love Shipment and Rust in one
"Hopefully they just remaster MW2 or BO2 and actually listen to the community. Cold War is one of the worst games I�ve ever seen before, but modern warfare is so much fun"
It used to be
A remastered MW2 Would be amazing. Was my first and favourite CoD.
Yeah and a remastered bo2 would be ruined by sbmm
Cold War is fun modern warfare isn�t but I highly doubt they would be doing 4 cods in 1 year plus stop crying that u can�t camp anymore
this is literally my routine since friday: 1) I open the game motivated 2) I convince myself that i can play with all the glitches 3) I look for a game 4) I start shooting at someone having NO idea if i�m hitting him or not 5) get killed by someone hidden better than when I used to play �hide and seek� 6) close the game 7) never touch it for the rest of the day

The only requirements released to aquire it were 1. Own MW and 2. Already own the Ronin skin. The challenge changed today. Instead of taking you to the store when you check the mission details the mission is already unlocked with 4 challenges,  the first being spray a wall downtown with Ronin as your operator.

If u are trying to level up MW guns do co-op mission strongbox kill the enemy npcs and enable some 2xp tokens and kill as many as u Can to level up the gun
Is that faster than consecutive supply runs in plunder?
"Would it work way better, then? Does it work right now, do you know?"
where i can find the tweet
[https://twitter.com/mixedbypogi/status/1358851169544589312](https://twitter.com/mixedbypogi/status/1358851169544589312)
"I was playing warzone plunder and was gaining double weapon XP, but since the double xp is over, I am not receiving any weapon XP in warzone either."
Cheers. Thank you.
"What I�ve been doing is queuing solo in the war zone plunders game mode and landing on recon contracts. Before you turn in/complete the contract, make sure you have the gun you want on equipped to receive the weapon xp. Landing outskirts helps you get AT LEAST 4-5 contracts done which is about 3000xp or 2-3 weapon levels per game. 

I also ran co-op but the xp in comparison to plunder is pretty low. You also get match xp from plunder which helps level you up. Hope this helps!"
"I think it definitely still is. There are a lot of bugs and errors at the moment, but they should be fixed soon hopefully"
"substantially better than CW tried giving that game a chance played for about a month after release then my friends told me to hop on MW one night and i�ve been having a blast. was going for damascus when these bugs started happening so that�s unfortunate, other than that it�s still the same great game you�d remember."
Since xp and leveling afu i been gettin my fix playin local shipment 2v6 bots for unlimited kills and time. Jus tryna get my moneys worth.
It�s definitely worth play (recent bugs aside) as there�s a strong player base .
You have to pay
Nope. You�ll have to buy a PC copy. Progress can sync though as they�re saved on your Activision account.
"Sounds like you're doing exactly what everyone thinks Activision wants you to do.

Bye for now"
"It�s just a personal decision dude. I love Battlefield 3 but had to play Battlefield 5 because they stopped supporting 3. Then now BF3 got remasted with mods and I�m back after 10 years. He likes CoD and he want contents, an at least functional game and something to fill the void of MW. Nothing wrong with that he is doing."
What u/Talking-Tree420 said. At least Cold War is functional by now and it fills the void MW left.
"You fell right into their hands. Take away shoot the ship and make it so you can't even level up weapons in one update. ""Well guess I'll try cold war"" That game is dying and there's no low they won't sink to get you to buy that game. More people are buying MW then Cold War. They're getting desperate."
Is that not a bug and they said they were working on it it�s just since another cod is out they will be focusing on that one maybe
"You're absolutely right. I'm aware i fell into their hands... Like i said, they won. There's nothing else we can do to save MW and i just gave up caring. If it ever comes back to what it was then count me in, i just want to put the drama aside and have fun."
Actually they said on twitter yesterday that they're aware and working on it. But go off.
so they are working on the XP???
The point is shit like this can�t happen all the money they make.. they can�t just break the game constantly it�s not a fact of fixing it it�s a fact of they constantly keep fucking up and it�s worse every time I mean it�s as bad as it can get what is the point of playing a 20 min game for 0-500 xp and no progress on your gun ranks? Your fine with that?
Sounds like a personal problem noobie boobie
Aren't you all about spreading love?
Guess I�ll die
"I had to deal with this in snd, this dude just kept spamming gas grenades on the bomb site"
Bot lobby lol
Reload. Kill. Reload. Kill. Reload. Kill. Reload. Kill. Reload. Kill. Reload. Kill. *dies while reloading*
This is why I stick to PC and not console. How is this unchallenging gameplay fun? What is the point of competing if no one shoot back? I get that you didn�t get bored because you get put in lobbies of the brain-dead but this is the lamest play ever.
ehhh idk it�s dependant on stats i play ps4 and don�t even have that decent of stats (1.2 kd/400 spm) and i my lobbies are mostly pc players. i think it just depends on how you actually play you could have a $3000 pc and still get lobbies like this so long as you consistently do bad.
Coming form someone who plays on both its no different othere than when you turn a corner  into an enemy kbm has a slighty faster reaction time thats it.
"how did 4 people miss you people always one tap me before i pop around a corner, i wish people missed shooting me once"
How do you join lobbies with bots wtf LOL
Build it for full mobility and range and you got the fastest killing smg
As long as you hit that first burst haha
I�ve been using the KSP-45 in warzone and it feels just like a high mobility FR. It�s so much fun in Plunder!
"You cant build for ""full mobility "" AND  range.   Pick one."
It�s always been like that
No buff your just cracked out of your mind my guy
[deleted]
its just a very bad fal in semi auto. semi auto is only effective at long range where the recoil makes the burst useless
"That's how I use it! 

I just wish the fire rate was the same as when it's burst."
It's the only gun I have obsidian. It melts. Shoot the head.
Oh dang
"why quit snd man, thats even more embarassing :/"
What was embarrassing
It's embarrassing that you use an spr
Why bother posting to Reddit? Lel
"First, it�s just an ads, I know it�s annoying but at least there is a button to shut it off and keep playing MW. Secondly, if you are playing this game for upcoming contents, then don�t, just drop the game and move on. There will be no
Season 7, no new guns, no new maps, operators, no nothing. What you�ve seen about Soap, the Sykov, CX-9, maps are all unultilized assets of the game that will either transfers to the follow up game or just scrapped. And if you play an FPS expecting more than a year of support (let alone proper support) then you have chosen the wrong franchise."
Post 87653769 about this.
I wasted a double xp token lol Im sitting here like hmm the weapon isn't leveling up half it's not just me though but fuck man unacceptable at this point.
We deserve like 5 double xp cards as compensation.
Bet you the devs downvoted.
Weapon XP is broken since the update. Please submit a bug report. https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-feedback-and-bug-reporting
Clear cache
I have this problem but wit my operator missions and it makes me mad asf
They DONT FUCKING FIX THIS BUG FOR A WEEK. ARE ALL WORKER ON HOLIDAYS???? just go and fix it how can it be to hard it dont thing they read the comments on redit
Everything is bugged in this game right now.
"Yeah man, a lot of issues. Hopefully they all get ironed-out..."
Im on the same boat as you. I thought today's weapon xp patch would solve it but it didnt for me. I really wanted the two skins that are offered for grinch in this pack. Let me know if they fixed the issue.
Hopefully we get some info soon...
"hi, did u solve this?"
"I been trying to do this for weeks I thought I was the only one. Please help And also the Stadium Easter egg is bugged too. W e opened the door to get the enigma gun off the table ( you can see it , but its covered by the netting of a empty care package crate and their stuck sideways in the table."
"That's unfortunate man, I hope that gets fixed soon..."
"Yup, same here. Drove me crazy, thought I did something wrong."
Yo I been having this exact problem too bruh everything�s bugged rn I�ve literally attempted to do the challenge 10 times and literally the challenge hasn�t gon up 1 bit
"Hahaha. At least I'm not the only one, though I am sorry to hear you're having an issue as well. Hopefully we can find some answers, or maybe this is a small error that will get fixed somewhere along the line."
bc challenge progress is and has always been bugged. it�ll sort itself out... eventually...
"I can only hope, haha."
So it's bugged? We need to attend an update or is gone forever?
Do you still have the Problem? I�ve got the Same Problem. I hate it.
"Yeah, still have it... I've just accepted it for now. I guess the extra styles for Grinch aren't necessary - though they would be nice to have."
I have the same Problem and I tried everything to solve it - without success.. hope there will be a fix soon..
"I have same problem, really wanted that skin aswell. Hope they sort it. This game is so bugged it sucks ass"
"Well your not missing out much, xp is bugged since weekend, no progress at all ..."
"Free bundle green item happens to my lady on PS4, very strange. It must be account specific, it still does it to her on my Xbox Series S."
"on ps4, there is a b button for ""clear new indicators"" or something, nothing like that for you?     You need to be hovered over class/store etc for it to show up.     Maybe restart the game an see if the sticks leveled up?"
"I haven't seen one but I haven't been looking for one either so I'll check for that

I have restarted the game still no leveling"
"1- go to warzone and private match then for controllers press down on the left stick when your over the load outs (it clears all green boxes.)



2- sadly there is a bug where xp is very weird my best guess is try either plunder or Co op since that isn�t broken but you can�t get skins outta it either"
"Completing contracts in Warzone earns weapon XP. Just start a plunder match and do as many contracts as you can.
You can earn around 1000 Weapon XP for doing 4-6 contracts.

Since multiplayer weapon xp is broken, this is the most efficient way to level up."
On Xbox I believe pressing in on Left or Right joystick clears all 'new' indicators.
It is bullshit my friend but I�m still hopeful that when the playlist updates tomorrow the xp thing will be fixed. Not likely I know but I can still hope.
[deleted]
Go complain somwhere else then. No one asked you and you didn't have to reply
How in the hell is this still not fixed?
I thought it was only me
"no, activision is shitting on hundreds of us don't worry fella"
? Over a year ?
"you can find youtube videos on the exact same topic from March 2020, it's almost comical how long this issue has been around"
"Like you have been living on the Hot side of this sub all this time? Every freaking week, updates, random days, whatever...there were like at least a dozen more post complaining about challenge not progressing and some have never been fixed for some people. This is the same shit now but 10 times worse, back then it was challenge and camo not progressing, now nothing is progressing."
"Ya it's fucked, I'm on my last damn SMG for damascus and can't unlock the other camo challenges past the long shot one."
dude that's depressing. I've been running around with stock everything though because im only level 30. seriously sad!
"They do, but this is all activision, they do this on purpose, because Cold War has xp and warzone has xp"
Devs don't care about MW anymore. It was abandoned for Cold War. Fuck these guys.
total scumbags.
"You do realize CW is made by 3arc, right?"
[deleted]
It�s a bug that screwed up progression in MW multiplayer since the new update that released on Thursday or Friday.. only way to level up guns between now and when it�s fixed is through Warzone unfortunately
"How can they mess up this bad??
Edit: I even used a double weapon xp token because I thought it's just so slow now..."
Don�t know nothing about it but out of curiosity what gun was it
"""AN-94"". Was the easiest one to unlock so I went for it."
I can't even enable 2FA in first place. It's broken.
"Did it fix itself? I have same problem with the COD app, but using Google authenticator. Android device. 

I can still play, just can't use the COD app."

Mad
Because it is final kill not kill of the game...
There can still be potg in tdm
[deleted]
Lol
"The Play of the Game clip never works anyway. Too many times I did something spectacular and the clip would only show me kill one or two players before it glitches off not showing the two or three others I murked.  That's one thing Cold Sore got right, it plays the entire sequence for the play of the game."
"I feel you, the final kill cam or play of the game are awful in mw... In cw it worked a lot better when I played the beta"
welcome to the party man lol my first 6 on i ever got was replaced by first blood someone just mounted getting one kill
Potg just provides encouragement for sweaty tryhards. Disappointing
It�s bugged they are fixing it
"Everyone is having same issue, apparently they're working on getting the bug fixed.."
Are they? For real? Where they announced it?
"It�s not a bug with the latest release, it�s a �feature�."
This still hasn�t been fixed? Really
Nope and even my xp is bugged to where Ive only earned 10 per match
"Yeah its pretty shit, but in saying that after thrashing Shoot The Ship for 2 weeks it's quite nice to play on different maps for change of pace. But always enjoy and appreciate when STS is back in the Playlist."
"I love all or nothing!! Right now it's on the regular mp maps instead of the gunfight maps, and 12 players instead of 3. It's so much more fun like this! I still miss shoot the ship tho lol"
"K, I�ll give it a shot."
it's total Ass!
"Actually, its one of the best we've had"
Really? To each their own I guess?
Maybe one day i'll get chem division for Mara. I hope so
Does it include her tanktop skin? Asking for a friend. I'm at work right now and can't check. How many cod points
No that skin was in a later season. #3 I think?
"It doesnt include the tank top skin. That was S3. The price for this specific bundle is 1600, while her s1 tier 100 skin will be in a 2400cp bundle"
[removed]
"Yo I pre ordered and played since season 0, but I slept on buying season one. I'm not really complaining, as really, i'm saying adios to my wallet because I'll be buying these bundles. No need to be a jerk, bud"
"It�s a bug since the new update.  If you didn�t have the season in which the operator was introduced, it won�t unlock just yet from what I�ve been reading."
"Can't be true. For example: I bought the 6th battlepass and unlocked Kyle that way, but his Operator-Missions also do not progress."
"A handful of these just popped up for me (playing on MW not CW), and I wonder if it was because I just happened to use spare coins on the battle pass so they ""popped up"", Minotaur, Mara, Alice etc.. but I'm experiencing the same problem, I do the tasks and it doesn't add towards completion"
It is bugged sadly
"It�s probably bugged, which is sad because I want otter and Bales skins"
Also note that the map isn't visible because I disabled it in the custom games settings
"Yeah just played the mosh pit today, same thing happend to me"
Also the HUD randomly shows up permanently when you spawn. This weapon inspection actually fixes that.
"Idk, I feel like this could be a bug but it could also be intentional. You can inspect your gun in some shooters with no HUD like Rising Storm to know how much ammo you have."
"Thats why i run hardcore for weapon showcase instead of realism, you can just trim the upper side of the screen to gwt rid of the compass"
"The details tho... I mean it makes sense it pops up cause you're inspecting the rifle, and probably did an ammo count too while the operator was at it."
good to know
Saturation too high
Helps spotting red dot on top of enemies
That's pretty neat
"well thats good, probably by design.you're inspecting your weapon, you should know how much ammo you've got by doing so.wonder if this is in hardcore. could be useful.  


\*edit: nope, not in hardcore.  well thats lame"
Nice
"Because youre inspecting the weapon, its intended"
Is it though? Why would weapon inspect need your HUD?
"After watching the video a whole once, I came to this conclusion too. Makes sense that it'd be by design. Your character is feeling out the gun, should know by know exactly how heavy 18 rounds feels :P"
"well, in the last round of barebones, killstreaks were being used so, i don't think that bugs are being fixed"
You can also see your HUD when you open the scoreboard
Damn that's cool
Lmaoooo so many bugs this latest update. Holy hell
"Nice! Finally took months before someone said anything about it.

Ever since normal infected came out with care package drops, I've been using this glitch for wasting time. 

Anyways, how this glitch work and stuff...

Moderate - Hard to pull it off (rng on allies, enemy players, killstreaks) 

You have to be alive.
You need an killstreak drop from care packages that drop time to time. One of these would work.

- Predator missile
- Wheelson 
- Chopper gunner 
- Ac-130 

Next! 
Early in the match, I recommend you to stay alive until there are only 5-8 or less players alive, because you will spawn near or right next to them (not in a zombie model but your own personal human model). 

Next!!
You need an enemy player that straight up kills you while you use said killstreak. No assassination. 
You have to time it right .5 seconds to hit it off.
Right before you enter the killstreak state, you have to activate the killstreak and be killed. 

Next!!! 
You will be spawned on the zombie side, but with your former human allies and you do not look like an zombie, just an enemy human with a red name. 

You cannot harm humans by shooting them or knifing/melee. 
You can kill humans by shooting their atv, claymores, ammo box. 
You can kill your friendly zombies up to 3 times.
However, if you kill 3 zombies, you will be killed for 1 minute for friendly fire. And then the glitch is over, you become a regular infected. 
You cannot get anymore ammo, claymore, stun grenades. 

Whats the purpose of all this? 
For griefing or trolling everyone. 

You can troll enemy humans by shooting them, distracting them for a bit while your infected allies kill them. Destroy their temporary barrier by shooting it. 
Annoying ATVs? Hop on and chase them down, shoot theirs as your allies swarm them as it breaks down. 

You can use your single stun grenade to stun the humans (useful in their last stand position, normal infected lobbies) 

You can super troll your infected allies, shoot them to get attention (you can kill them) as they helplessly attack you for no damage and get pissed off lol
Just remember to not kill more than 2, otherwise the you will be killed for team killing for 1 minute. 

The only things I wasn't been able to find out was...

The claymore doesn't work on enemy humans once the glitch is activated? It can kill, if you shoot it yourself. I can't find out if it triggers. (I died too much before it can happen) 

When you have a rocket launcher as a secondary, I couldn't find out if you can kill human players as a infected using rockets. 

Like I said earlier, RNG factors in the match.

You had to have good allies to stay alive until you get care packages and have the match losing
Need to get the right killstreaks.
You need enemy players to come up to you to knife you instead of assassination or throwing knife, which throws off the timing of the glitch. 

Can't test it out anymore because last month, my nephews were touching my ps4 and after work for 5 hours? Came home to find the ps4 in safe mode...
Had to reboot it clean, lost everything.
And encounter the infamous copy add-on disc, which I couldnt solve after 1 week of frustration. 

Have to download the game (free warzone) or buy the dang game again full price. 

Oh.
If you tried this on groundwar, you will simply instantaneous respawn at your base but you lost the kill streak. 

Haven't tested on other game modes though, such as s&d, etc. But I guess it won't affect it much at all or nothing."
That�s cool
and that perk to spawn ammo and armor will def help.  and ya... dont cut the gate open!!!!
"You may have just saved Modern Warfare for me, my thanks kind sir"
"Bring few sentry turrets, run unlimited wave missions, have your weapon out and kill chain for xp timer, and just get free xp."
i�m gonna try this out i hope this helps
It works I just maxed my FAL
"Used to be up all night farming strongbox with my friends, good times, glad to see this getting more recognition."
uhh for some reason im not getting any weapon xp from this...
Which mission are you playing
"Yeah but I have no friends that play cod and there is no one playing special ops, soo..."
Do you play on Ps?
I love it
You know what a funny thing is the xp isn't a glitch as we all know because if it was a glitch with  the xp it would also affect CO-OP but it doesn't only MP hmmmmm
"That�s� Not how that works at all.

Correlation =\= causation. Basic scientific methods."
Yeah back at S4 my lobbies were always 100-200 ping
"It's still playable you just won't do as good, before the update I was almost always top leaderboard only because I would run and gun so I usually got the most kills but with the downfall of having the same amount of deaths because my play style was a little predictable. But since the update I'm pretty much always the bottom now having 3 times the deaths all of a sudden, the reason I say it's not completely playable yet is because if you adapt a little bit by also using a shield and using a low recoil gun you can still do decent but at the same time it's completely useless to so because you get nothing for it besides feeling a little good that you done good in the horrible lobbies"
"Yeah, it is playable, but I like to use weapons that aren't meta (sometimes I use meta, depends on how I feel) and I like to try to grind for Damascus, I guess I'll have to adapt and play like a tryhard. Not my cup of tea, but alas! What can be done. I hope the next CoD does away with strict SBMM."
"Thought it was me. I played on Sunday night and got my azz kicked over and over again. I kept checking my internet to see if something was wrong, but there was nothing wrong there. Last night after getting off from work, I started to let off some steam playing that game, but remembered the unfun time I had on Sunday. I passed. I'm gonna try tonight and see what happens."
"'eezer Goode
'eezer Goode
He's Eebenezer Goode."
"You sir have been shadow banned!

&#x200B;

Happened to me after the patch last friday, but as of yesterday I am back to my normal lobbies."
"Can you be shadow banned on PS4? Either way, until it gets fixed, MW 2019 just won't be enjoyable for me. That patch really did a number on the game. I started getting these lobbies after the second patch last week."
"The hecticness of shipment is what makes it fun! I wish the MW spawn system didn't suck balls, though, cuz then it might be just as good as shipment from CoD 4."
"Its hard to make good spawn systems when people can slide off of objects as they mantle, when everyone can run forever, and when everyone can use tactical sprint. They also never had to deal with Wheelsons, Phosphorous, or ENEMY AC-130 ABOVE!"
"I understand why people like it, but dying every 2 seconds even if me or my team is winning is not fun for me anymore"
"My personal saying is �there�s no winning in shipment.�

Even if your team wins, it can feel awful getting spawn trapped for 2 minutes.

I like shipment for hip fire camos, and leveling weapons quickly, but shoot house is more fun to me."
I like it when I need to grind a challenge
Yes
Yes of course it's the best along with shootout house. People complaining I die every 2 seconds. Well no shit.
I don't know if you are kidding or what. You just said you saw how the entire community is mad as we are ALL in your situations and you are asking us to have a solution when it's clear that there's none?
"They do it because of replies like the one above from Isaac, who make OP feel like this is a situation only happening to them."
"I'm sorry, geez. I haven't seen any posts here about this"
What mode are you playing? And do you have the base weapons unlocked?
"I'm playing 10v10 TDM and yes I have both the weapons unlocked, the leveling worked fine every other time I've played, but today it just isn't working"
"I forgot to post this yesterday, this is at the end of the survival game."
"Go to the settings and somewhere in there it will tell you what data packs you have and don't have, try that."
Or is there another way for me to get a Bruenn?
Add the new data pack...
It says they are all downloaded.
How did you unlock Damascus oil rig ?
You have to purchase the MDMA pack.
Jev: i played modern warfare so much that i unlocked damascus maps
You have to get 10000 triple mounted longshot kills near smoke shortly after reloading on every map
That�s sick lol
I kinda want that to happen to me lol
Needs more RGB.
I only eat organic salmon
It's been happening scince the day I installed the game it sucks on certain maps and is really cool on others
What cyberpunk should of played like
Looks like a treyarch game now
Right?! A Limited game mode with this would be kinda fun.... for a round or two.
I�ll have what he�s having....
Honestly i want LSD mode to become a feature
Try rising storm 2 Vietnam. Game has a Woodstock filter you can play with. It�s great
[deleted]
No reason they couldn't put it under the color options and let people live their lives
Same
It is it's called an AMD GPU
I remember in Rise of the Traid they had a shrooms mode you could enable and yea from personal experience it was pretty similar.
cod cyber punk version
I thought the same lmao
Needs more T posing
"Bravo six, we have a city to burn."

Nah it's just Black Ops III
I was going to say What cyberpunk should of been
They aren�t going to change anything if people don�t stop buying it every year
"I actually want buy Cold War, but just for Zombies. But I don't wanna give Activision money, so I'm gonna buy it pre owned, as I think others should. I have given exactly ZERO dollars to Activision for CoD, as I have bought every CoD I have second hand, and I believe that's a good thing. We'll save money, discourage poor business practices, while playing the game we want."
"I didn't buy CW for that purpose, but then they released Raid... I got weak. :'("
I didn't buy cold war for this reason and because of the level of SBMM.
^^^ THIS ^^^
"Thing is while I feel like CW is a step back, I don�t think that it plays in a way Treyarch didn�t intend. 

They just didn�t make good design choices. Only thing that might have improved is the graphics in multiplayer."
The textures improved a little bit I think it actually looks worse because of lighting.
"not only a step back it�s an absolutely abysmal game , ive seen better playing ps3 titles"
You're forgetting that they work on each game for 3 years. Modern warfare has been in the works since 2016 when they released infinite warfare
"Normally that is true, but BOCW was made in 18 months. Treyarch began work on the game in around may 2019."
I didn�t forget that. I said that the game is 80% done a year in advance
"Weapon XP, soldier rank XP, operator missions, and all the associated unlocks are non-functional in MW since Friday. Only prestige XP is working in MW. Activision support has only a single canned response to a public tweet. There has been no status update.

"" Please note that studio is currently looking into this issue at the moment. Please hang tight for now and stay tuned in-game or to our official channels for updates. \^DW """
Promote this hashtag    [\#modernwarfare\_brokenbyupdate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modernwarfare_brokenbyupdate?src=hashtag_click)  .  I'm posting it all over Raven's and Activisions twitter and insta.   Let's post this everywhere until they do something!
I noticed for some players like Handler seem to be normal for them.
"Been trying everything since Thursday as I�ve just unlocked PBR after having a break and getting back into the game. Warzone and all related game types work fine - Cold War works fine. Just no character or weapon xp in MW, interestingly can still unlock camos for weapons however. Very annoying as Cold War sucks imo"
I just unlocked the Amax and I can�t level it up. Fml
That is actually the weapon I am trying to lvl up too!
Has anyone seen any updates about a fix?
Nah just give them a fews weeks and itll be set
"I'm getting XP, only it's very little, I got a 50 kill game and managed an amazing 100xp on my weapon and 300xp on my lvl during happy hour :/"
I just got 40 kills with the jak12 In one game. Started at lvl 5 and was lvl 5 after. That ain't right
"Man 100 xp. I got 20 kills and got a whopping 4 xp, but got a kill with a gun and got 25 or something like that. Pisses me off. I just started playing so I have one gun with attachments. Can't unlock any for any others...."
"But does the weapon lvl up? Because for me it appears that I received xp, and when I go to the loadout check out the xp lvl, it doesn�t change"
"I love how I go to the activision support page, and the only suggestion they have for me is the Chat with the Activision Agent. The Chat is always Offline, even though it should be online at this hour."
I waited 90 minutes in the que only for it to time out with 3 minutes left.
"I waited 2 hours and did chat with activision support yesterday evening. This was the response.

""Hi, I'm sorry to hear that, we are actually investigating the issue but there's no ETA for the fix but I would hope it will be fixed soon since it's already under investigation,""

Thats it. No idea if/when it will be fixed. All we have is ""hope""."
"I'm having a issue with Operator missions not ""tracking"". I am to unlock skins and all i have to do is use 5 field upgrades but it does not track them after the match. also no XP growth at all on the Bar after match. so annoying"
Yeah Activision doesn't care anymore they want you to buy Cold War so they not going to revert the update or patch soon.
I've never heard of someone having this problem. People sometimes put double claymores so it could be that. My EOD has been working the same
"Yea... I thought it might be double clays, but this last game I played it was noticeable. There was only 1 that killed me right after I stimmed?... lol I�m super confused."
You playing HC?
"Nah, core. EOD only a works once for HC, right?"
Games just probably broken:(
"Might be right?. Idk, unless it�s intended to be that way? 

If so, I didn�t see a patch or anything."
works for me
"Best answer ever in every thread asking for help.

I hereby give you the ""[Works On My Machine](https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/03/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ff992970c-pi.png)"" Award"
Any suggestions?... lmao
E.O.D is buggy like that. One time it tanks a full JOKR missile and another you get one tapped by a frag
"Lol, it�s got me raging. 

I�m playing SnD and still getting grenaded 4 out of 10 times off spawn start."
"Duude, eod has always been shit but recently it�s almost like EOD just save you from a little slither of health by an explosive and if you are a little hurt and then a grenade comes along you are a dead man, eod is weak but I think that�s for the best."
"i was wondering about this too (hc:dom), i think like many other elements in this game, it works some times and some times it wont (eod, since last update), like ie. aim-assist (since s5), i think it could be a form of lag, the connections/sbmm are terrible atm?"
Sorry your crutch isn't working right
?
The laser show was cute lol
Haha thanks!
You videos always make me laugh man. Was happy to see your new one today :D
Thanks!
"This video is funny as fuck.
Dont stop doing this videos"
Tf. Bring it up as much as possible
Why? Activision on is already working on it. They made a post on Twitter or Facebook (idk) that they are already working on it and will patch it.
"You come here for epic clutches? 
Maybe go to you tube mate, Reddit isn�t for you lol"
"No, I just mean I come here for vid

Yeah I can�t talk my way out of this but you can still understand what I mean"
Down voted. Fix hiTmARkEr & AiM aSsiSt!!!!! Incompetent Raven software
That last part made me go cross-eyed lolz
"XP glitch, it�s happening to a lot of people"
"ah makes sense then, thanks for helping :)"
bug. Expect it to be patched this week. Just sit tight
Idk what's happening here
"I was actually going to cut it out to prove my point but my software wasn�t working, basically I�m asking for an option to drop equipment"
What the fuck are you doing
At least they saved you the cash
Yeah
The fuck I�m seing?
Sorry I didn�t clarify: I�m asking for an equipment drop option so people don�t have to do something like what I did in the beginning
that does not clear this up at all

I am not in Windows safe mode. In Windows safe mode you dont even have sound. So
Don't use safe mode. It also resets a lot of your graphical settings for more stability. It can mess with some of your controls apart from making the game look awful
I had no choice
But how can i Turn It off
I've never had it mess with my controls.

"Stock is faster while standing still. The stippled grip is mostly for sprint out, with a small decrease in ads time."
So the grip tape increases less ads but has a higher sprint to fire time? Thanks

"All your attachment questions answered:

"The LMGs and Launchers should be no problem on normal core Quickplay playlist (or GW if that is your bag). I did used the recent Shoot the ship on HC to finish off the melee weapons though. It would have been a right PITA otherwise. I�d also wait till they fix the current weapon XP bug, though you can unlock some of your camos if the category is already unlocked."
Good call on waiting for the bug to be patched. But I am glad to hear the launchers shouldn�t be too difficult- my preconceived impression was they�d be quite tedious and time consuming/challenging to complete.
I got my launchers done on free for all thanks to all the personal radars if that helps. but the rest are easier on shoot the ship
"I found ground war really helpful for the JOKR, the key was don�t waste time ie if other people are using faster launchers to shoot everything down then just leave and rejoin. I ranked all launchers up to lvl 31 before going for camo�s"
"Actually, STS was really helpful for JOKR kills too. Just remembered."
"So, if your weapons are max leveled, meaning all camo classes are unlocked for those weapons, you can do it in any core/hardcore mode with a bit of grinding.  I'd say Domination for the LMGs, Free For All or Domination for Launchers... but for the shield & knife you'll probably just have to wait for StS OR be bold and carry one or the other as a secondary and run with it."
"I think the biggest mistake people go for when getting damascus is not using the launchers as a secondary the entire time. I think they were like my 3rd platinum 

When I did the shield there was no shoot house or shipment, and I kinda think they're overrated for the camos themselves. They're good for leveling it up, but you often die too fast to get streaks or you just get constantly shot in the back. What really worked for me was playing hc dom/hard point and camping the lanes towards objectives"
Game is alive and well but there are XP progress/lack of hitmarker issues at the moment.
Like bad Server connection?
Still the only PC FPS worth playing at the moment. I'm in OCE and would be playing it this week if my console squaddies weren't taking a break due to the lack of hitmarkers bug :P
Sweaty
Don�t reward Activision by buying this game twice
No.
No
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Reinfected would be fun if the game didn't crash every game and if there were more maps.
"You can use Warzone for that. Go play Plunder and complete supply run contracts. Those give 500 to 1000 XP per contract completed and, usually, you can do close to 10 in a single game of Plunder"
is that weapon xp or normal xp?
"I�ve noticed that it occasionally goes up, and in such games, it�s when I used my gun to shoot equipment or kill streaks. Besides that you have to switch to Warzone or Co-op to get gun XP"
You can level up in co-op special ops for now.  The update last week has several bugs and weapons experience is one of them.
It does level up but  at a snails pace
"The last update broke xp gains. No, it�s not a conspiracy to push you forward to WZ/CW. No, they haven�t mentioned yet when they will fix it or even acknowledged it at all."
"Lies. There's been tweets from Activision that they're aware and working on a fix, although they haven't been able to confirm when they'll have it fixed :)"
You don�t have to own Cold War to run modern warfare wdym lmao stop the gate keeping around mw both games are published by activision and they want money so ofc they�re gonna push Cold War as much as they can
you're a dumbo he talked about the game running better since he has gotten cw. Learn how to read lmao
So my game crashes and ping hikes stopping were just coincidence? Ok .... I'm not 'gatekeeping' ((I'm old please explain that to me tho!) If you want and enjoy the game fab! Enjoy - I don't  hence why i didnt buy it myself.
Meanwhile im literally begging others to share MW with me so i can finish my Obsidian journey.
How do you mean share? I'm slowly working camos
Buying cold war improved your performance in MW? How?
Not my performance I'm still shit at the game lol - just seems MW runs better I haven't crashed since or had insane lag spikes (500mbs net wired)
yep. just let us know when it works again in MP. atm it only works in warzone and coop
"The thing with Cold War is it feels deeply unrewarding to play. 

Having a good game and only unlocking one attachment isn�t exactly a good loot chase.

I�m all in for a MW2 though."
"I can�t be the only one who thinks remastered games should be left alone, right? Remastering a game should mean updating the graphics to modern standards, and that�s it. When you mess with the gameplay, i.e. adding more challenges, weapons, maps, you are losing the core essence of the original game. You aren�t remastering a game, you�re reimagining it."
"I understand the sentiment around not fixing what's not broken, but at the same time my ultimate dream CoD is MW2 mechanics and adding maps from games with worse mechanics. MW3 and Ghosts probably have a bunch of really nice maps that would shine much better in MW2. Halo did something close to similar with The Master Chief Collection with many maps and modes in the game and all the different game mechanics. Adding maps is honestly not too bad if the maps flop since we can vote to skip maps anyways."
"I'll believe it when I see it

Having said that I prefer MW19 to MW2 anyway. If they replace danger close with EOD in MW2 that would fix all noob tube problems instantly 

Also 4chan sources are very rarely true."
"At this point I'm more wondering about MW 2019 sequel, I hope they just make MW Reboot into a Hitman or Total War Warhammer style installments of building & improving on the base than redoing everything. Basically Shipment and other MW 2019 maps on launch than shoved post-launch content, MW 2019 Weapons & Blueprints carry over etc."
If you have XMP enabled try disabling it.
"So, it seems like because my XMP was disabled, the game loved crashing, but now i turned it back on it seems to be running fine?"
try to use default bios settings or update your mobo firmware
"Mate this has been happening to me since the early Feb update. Tried EVERYTHING I could find online to try and fix it, no luck. No response from Activision either. Only game it happens in. Its absolute bullshit."
currently having this problem and ive tried every troubleshooting guide under the sub. no fixes.
For the sniper rifles I did them in Groundwar. Super easy. Barely an inconvenience.
"Does this work with marksman rifles too? I've got the Kar, Mk2 and HDR left to get gold then I'm done. Ive heard that the HDR was good in ground war, but I've been hesitant to play it, as, as you could probably tell from the post, I pretty much exclusively play hardcore bcs I cant aim at all lol. But I'll give it a shot for the HDR. Thanks for actually taking the time to read this, it means a lot bro"
"I platinumed most of my weapons on the Core Quickplay list, and never once ventured into GW. I only went HC to finish off the handguns and melee. I just played normally, and agree, Hardhat and Cheshire Park are nice maps for sniper/marksman unlocks. Ok, I started the Damascus grind back in October and only pinged it last week, but it was a fun experience."
"Props for getting it done so fast, I've got about 5 days of playtime and im at 24/39 I think. I like to play hardcore mostly because I'm dogshit at the game and it actually gives me a fighting chance to kill people, but I agreed to give ground war a try for the HDR, so what harm can giving it a go be. But thanks for backing me up that cheshire park isnt an overall bad map and does have its uses. But hey, well done again on completing your damascus grind and I wish u all the best in eithe dm ultra, finishing the DLC guns, getting obsidian or actually enjoying your life"
"Actually, it's quite enjoyable to play with every single one gun of this game.

The only thing i recommended for sure is

Patience

And use the levels as opportunity to grind the cammos."
"Yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed playing around with weapons I�d not normally touch. I just loved the look of the Oden with that massive fuck-off silencer."
"Yeah, I think im at 24/39 golds for damascus, and Ive done most of the hard ones. Ive got platinum melee, launchers, shotguns and pistols. Ive got gold on the AX-50 and Dragunov and im about halfway through the HDR, after that its pretty much smooth sailing to damascus, its just time consuming to grind the AR's now nothing difficult.

By gun, im assuming you mean gun, not wapon, because the riot shield and crossbow really arent fun to use lol"
I forgot if there's grip tape on the HDR but if there is then stippled grip tape
"I think there is but mines level 23 and I havent got any blueprints with it so I cant get it yet lol, I am planning to put it on there when I unlock it tho"
"for the hdr you can use the vlk, not a true sniper but ehh. IIRC there is no stippled or small barrel so that's what you get"
"Ikr, why cant they add a shorter barrel, everything else has one. Im currently running the MG91 with the VLK because its low level and im trying to unlock all the ACOG reticles as I go. But on my cheshire park loadout (Kali sticks bcs ive got gold on all but like 3 secondaries and I like ghost and the HDR with the above loadout) I occasionally run the VLK optic, but it depends on where Im spawning really"
honestly I just sat on the middle wall overlooking mid on shoothouse for my snipers. super easy
"As a degenerate, i prefer either the shanty town wall or the big block by C because centre wall is only useful when people run across centre lane or is also shooting across trying to get mounted/longshot kills and 3 kills without dying is hard when ur shit, so uve gotta hope 3 different people don't see u and u can get them easily. That and I get like one shoothouse lobby a day if im lucky lol"
what about launchers? i need launcher tips
Here have a an award for the effort
"Yo thank you bro, I appreciate it man"
"For snipers, I like to use the cronen optic over the VLK, but it�s personal preference.

I�ve got 9 weapons left personally. Joker, RPG, Scar, LMGs(besides the SA87), HDR, AX-50, and Kar-98.

I�m saving the Kar-98 for last so I can hit a trickshot to get Damascus."
"Im mixig between the ACOGs because im trying to do some reticle challenges as I go, im on VLk headshots and Viper headshots at the moment but im hoping to have both of the blue dots by the time I reach Damascis.
Respect for the Kar, Im planning on trying to get it all done bar one kill with 5 attatchments and then hit a trickshot for damascus then.
U need help with any of the weapons I can, Jokr is best done on shipment, stand on C flag and shoot over to A, you will get all 4 kill challenges done if you have amped equipped, CUAVs, Pradars and Vtols are the best for challenges, I got the AX-50 gold on sunday, I mostly used either mono supressor, 7 round mags or the tac laser, ads stock, variable zoom scope and flinch resistance or short barrel, ads stock vz scope flinch resistance and the tac laser if I was on a smaller map so I could ads fast enough.
Out of those Ive done the JOKR RPG PKM AX-50 and from the pkm I can give you tips for the other lmgs if you want"
"I did all of Damascus in shoothouse and shipment, snipers included. Only did hardcore for pistols and riot shield. 

The hdr is slower than even the Rut ex for quick scoping but I still did pretty good with it so I think the attachments you have are good enough. I even had a variable zoom on it.

Ars take the longest so I would go ahead and get those out of the way."
"I actually like hardcore, that's why it's my default game mode and why I asked about it for the hdr (I think) but I'm down to give core another try. I've currently got the tac laser, the ads speed stock, focus and the bipod on my hdr, its level twenty something and I dont have stippled griptape as of yet. I tried the variable zoom scope on it but it felt like I was playing with the lowest ads speed ax50 i could make so I gave up on it
Are there any other attatchments you would recomend for it

Ars are on my list to do but most of them need leveling, as I dont have any of them max level currently, whereas I do have a couple of smgs max level so I'm currently trying for those until the xp glitch is gone, then I'm probably gonna finish them anyway, then do snipers appart from one kill for reptile on the kar so I can get a trick shot for Damascus, then I'm probably get Ars done, then finish lmgs because that will be a breeze then work on my trickshotting skills with a perk or something for the kar, then when I'm comfortable take the perk off and trick shot my way into damascus.

However I'm also trying to max out my riot shield at the same time. I have gold and I really want obsidian + the obsidian emblem and the obsidian calling card and maybe the damascus one too but that's gonna be a lot of pain as I'm currently at 368 of the 750 kills I need for obsidian so that's going to be a struggle to get. Either way thank you for ur reply, I will give core a better chance for grinding"
Fake
How does that even work? Nothing seems to happen when he speaks but the recorder works?
my id is 2482363 u can check my account too
"Well I�ve stopped playing ever since they rolled the update out, my first instinct is head to Reddit and my god, the update that wasn�t even for MW, broke MW. The last two week before the update is the most peaceful and quiet time ever since CW. They could have just left it like that and we will forever be grateful that they stop giving a fuck and leave the game alone in it previous state of calm, fun and complaint-free. But really, if you can stop stupid parents from annually giving their hard-earned cash to this turdshit company then maybe that will make a dent on their profits. Otherwise I don�t see how this, this whole SBMM, camper catering, drip-feeding and omitting contents is gonna stop any soon. 

You shouldn�t be asking people who have already bought to stop playing, I got bamboozled, you got bamboozled, everyone got bamboozled into buying this game expecting it to change the franchise. It�s up to us to spread the words to the people (esp. children) who are looking to buy an FPS game to stay the fuck away from anything Call of Duty and Activision. The more we do it, the more it hurts them. Stop playing won�t do crap, I�m convinced that the majority (like 99%) of CoD players are a bunch of morons. Buy - play - complain repeat, buy - play - complain repeat. The money keep coming and it�s still us getting the shittiest end of the stick. 

Warzone need to fuck off too, this game has been so such a rollercoaster ride of hell ever since Warzone exists. Like I can go on but everyone knows this already. Basically the whole gaming community hyping an 2017 dead trend. Warzone is just another PUBG on its way to its grave because of all this cheating going on and they ban people not base on evidence but on stats. Yeah that worked really well with Battlefield 5, yeah, totally cheater-free, totally legit banning people who are legit and have invested in CoD points, the greatest part is most of them never got their account back. What a fucking joke of a company, does EA still receive the Golden Turd this year? They should pass it on."
You are not wrong sir.
looooooool look at this comment. wow. you must need tissues 24/7.
"If I deleted every single game I wasn't entirely and totally accepting of, I'd have nothing to play."
"On 11th June 2018 they released a Bo3 patch that completely broke a DLC map (Gorod Krovi) on console to the point that it would crash all the times with no exception in the final cutscene, preventing you from getting the trophy - Love and War - (and potentially also another trophy -A Better Tomorrow -) and the in game rewards for completing all the maps (at least in solo, for the trophy the only workaround was downgrading the game with some third party softwares and doing it offline without consumables, and for the in game rewards you needed to rely on kind strangers who had completed all the maps before to complete the worst map humanity has ever witnessed).

They could have reverted that as well, but guess what, the patch came out on 15th August 2019 after over 1600+ people from reddit and trophy hunters communities from Xbox and PS4 joined writing at the same time to the BBB.

It took them over 1 year."
"Exactly my thoughts. It broke the game we paid money for to fix a bug in the 'free to play' game. Btw, yes they can revert an update. Plenty of other game developers have done this in the past."
you should mute your game chat when streaming
"Sometimes I leave it on just for the reaction audio clips lol, but usually I have it off xD tnks 4 the tip tho"
What fast strafing!  Whats your attachments?
"Cranked increases strafe speed, so I�m pretty sure that�s what it was."
Yeah it was the strafing my good man
If you knew that then why say anything....what's understood dont need be explained....   #not4Debate
"~Stoner~ (its bruen, sorry) is super op, but good clip, that was awesome"
"Stoner is a CW weapon, and this is in MP, not WZ."
Aimbot
"ur giving him a compliment bc it�s obvious he doesn�t have aimbot, he missed a couple of shots"
You�re stupid
"I mean, i don't even have aim assist on and im playin on a ps4 pro xD"
"I'm playing it on XSX and it's pretty good, i think it's the same on PS5"
I know this may sound weird bit did you get a calling card called 'spread the love'?
Yes
"Go to warzone and do a plunder match with the weapon equipt, other than that I don't know"
As Val not leveling.. That would be a nice and well-deserved nerf to it
"Holy fucking shit, you beat me to it. I have been trying to level up my Kar98k for straight 10 matches now dropping an average of 20kills per game and this motherfucker is stuck at lever 15(where I started from) I have a feeling the devs are doing this on purpose to make people buy the new game."
"The official activision support account tweeted that the devs are looking into the drop in XP gain, so it should be fixed pretty soon."
"In case anyone's looking, no I don't think it did."
"If youre playin on high texture resolution or if you have raytracing on, those could be why. Thats all i got for ya"
I'm having the same issue but I'm thinking it's the most recent patch that did it since it broke a lot of other things in the game
"happens to me every time. just lower resolution and texture quality, worked for me. i run the most trashy graphics, but at least i dont get fps drops"
"Seriously though, whatever IW did with the lighting in this game is fucking beautiful. I genuinely prefer to play NVG gamemodes with the NVG off and a thermal sight. Sure, I get completely fucked, but my eyes orgasm."
"Lol. It does look amazing, there's certain spots on each map where it's actually better to have the goggles off."
"It's the only gamemode where i feel actually stealthy and tactical. Highly underrated. I'm running an Aug with a thermal sight, smoke grenade, c4, aim walking and checking corners, breaching buildings. My only wish was that there would be slightly more downsides to keeping on your night vision goggles."
"Yes. you can definitely be more stealthy and use different tactics. There's more of a learning curve, where you can tell who's better at night ops and who hasn't really gotten it down yet."
"It's in the quick play filter, but nobody touches it 

It absolutely deserves a spot in the playlists on the front page permanently.

I do wish TDM was in the moshpit rotation.  NVG TDM is awesome"
"Noooo, the playlist in the quick tab is realism, this current playlist is NVG ONLY. And TDM is in this one, which plays best imo."
"This might be a hot take but honestly, just keep all the playlists! Keep a small map playlist with Shipment, Shoot house and Rust, keep NVG and Realism modes, keep all the different gunfight modes (2v2, 3v3, snipers only,...). Why they always have to get rid of something before adding something else is beyond me. The game has an enormous playerbase, just keep all gamemodes!"
"Seriously, I dabble in all of the playlists, while NVG is my favorite, it's fun to switch it up ya know. That's what makes it fun, variety!"
NOO I VOTED WRONG I MEANT I WANTED IT HOW DO I UN-VOTE
"It's ok, we know where your heart is lol"
They should just make every game mode available in mw because they fucked everyone with cw
I wonder who's really in charge of these playlist changes. I finally got my brother to delete CW and come back to MW full time lol
I wish they'd add it back to the Hardcore filter list.
"I'm having the same issue, I can't get any prestige xp or weapon xp , wont even show up in game when killing players or doing objectives"
It really sucks. I just destroyed a game using a pila and got nothing for it
Take my award. You deserve it.
Thanks I guess
Ah I remember the first time I got kills like this
Cool?
"You're using arguably the least skill-intensive weapon (tied with the SPR obv) and you're saying ""get wrecked""?

To each their own lmao"
Ok
"""least skill-intensive weapon""

The other cunt is using a fucking riot shield."
What does it being a Kar98 have to do with him hitting a no scope.
Least skill intense weapon cough as Val mp5 725 m4
AS VAL and SPR is stupid broken on core. No skill
spr is so annoying the iron sight is actually easy to use so everyone runs around with super quick ads
The FR 5.56 is so underrated cuz its one of the fastest killing guns
Straight sleeper just hit all shots and one bursts
that thing is great but it was a pain to unlock gold
Until you need to spray down 2 or 3 people and suddenly it's awful
"UZI is hands down my favorite, and the only gun I have obsidian. 

My other 2 favorites are the mp7, and the mp5"
Ram 7 is the goat and nobody can tell me different
it�s underrated in warzone fs. i might start using that with the kar98k for a good close/long range combo
Aug is super underrated
"it is, but it's only top tier with mp5, m4 and co, not actually op like as val for example"
"Out if the listed ones: As Val.

The easiest: As Val.

The most versatile OP gun if you have 5 braincells: FAL

The cheesiest OP guns: SPR + Kar

The secretly best gun in the game if you have hands: Model 680"
"Fal, AS Val, and SPR are so far above everything else, it�s ridiculous. 

After that, MP5, Uzi, and Amax. There�s other guns that are solid, like the M4 or Ram, but fall short when compared to the previously listed options."
Amax
Crossbow
those thermite tips hit different
"It's not one I like, but definitely the AS VAL. It's easily broken, 30 round mag, quick ads, quick fire rate, soft recoil nd pretty high ttk"
that thing is like the modern warfare FFAR
"the AS-VAL right now is the most broken but its not fun to use.

I love the fennec, i got it gold 2 hours after it came out, i love the thing."
"As broken as the piece of shit As Val is, it's not even the most broken gun in the game sadly. Not even place 2 :("
I legit ground the finn and got damascus in 2h after it came out and took 4 days to get obsidian and now its so underwhelming and i feel like i got the tcm pack for nothing
"I'd say the CR-56 Amax, mad solid ttk and great mobility. Overall it's top tier imo."
"OK is too good in this game.  MP5/M4 is still goated combo.  Amax/ram/asval best for non OK class.  Then there's the mp5/uzi +ax50/spr combo for search/sniper maps like picca/asshair/suldal.  Overall a year later it's still mp5/m4, too good, too easy to use, too versatile."
Did the m4 get a buff? Seems like more people are back on it
"For MP, 

The best gun is hands down the AS Val, takes a bit of skill to control it past 30m, so it�s a little hard to long-range beam."
"I am based, i only use an AK with all default attachments and FMJ."
"nerf val, high rate of fire with high damage...."
"I think its the M13 because it have less recoil than any other weapon and its very good for medium and large ranges, its also good for warzone, if you have stopping power rounds it kills faster than a MAC10"
The Scar is the best weapon platform in the game and if you think different you're a knob.  Fight me IRL sweatbuckets.  I'm j/k I like all the guns except launchers.
Unironically tho the scar is really good
"Hdr, always has been"
U do realise that u earn that 500 cp through the battlepass
This is the answer. You get the 500 for free when you unlock them via their level in the battle pass. Sorry for the bad news.
"It didnt say 500 by  ""earning"" It said 500 ""free"". Big difference"
[removed]
"It didnt say 500 through battle tiers. It said 500 ""free"""
the whole game is ripping you off
They count the cod points that are labeled free. It�s a bullshit trick.
"Thats what a scam. It says ""free"" when buying the pass. Nothing about having to  earn it after buying pass which dies not equal free."
I mean you purchased the game of course you got ripped off. This game is terrible.
I stopped playing after they turned the game into a sales pitch for a cartoon game called black ops ..
"That skin has been there for awhile, it�s for the sparks bundle so it�s definitely coming soon"
Is since christmas we're waiting for these bundles...Most likely they'll came in fro teh 1 year warzone anniversary...I hope...
Hopfully along with the vault packs!
"Same problem here...  
It's a known issue - the devs are allegedly working on it. No ETA.  
^(Source: Activision Support twitter)"
"It�s bugged, has been for about a week. No response from any devs"
I hope it gets fixed soon enough. Its annoying af.
How do you fix it
"There is a glitch that only lets you gain weapon xp in warzone, so just do plunder"
Those Oakley hard knuckles are minty
Gucci non standard gear for when you get tired of the crap the Qs give you.
"Prefer Outdoor Research or PIG�s personally. Bulky gloves have their spot, but I can�t stand the Oakley�s at times. Definitely better than Mechanix in terms of durability though."
"So that's what they're called.. thanks!

Not that I'd buy them, but I appreciate learning stuff. Not so much at work, but pop culture shit relevant to my interests, fo sho."
Never thought I would see someone bought a game because of gloves but alright
"Bought MW for the fun MP, fantastic gunplay and weapon customization, ended up being a watch addict"
honestly I can respect that
It was the reload animations that did it for me.
"I straight up bought the Spy Games outfit for domino for the sole reason that the gloves are one of the most detailed pair in the game, her view model with that outfit is A1."
Wtf is this.
it's epic
Especially Mara�s gloves
"I personally love the knock off Mechanix ""Technician"" gloves"
Small map with cover should have been an option. Between the two will have to be small map with no cover. MW has some big maps so small ones will do.
"I agree, if vacant had more maneuverability from the c flag spawn that would be a great example of this"
Livestock is a super underrated map
Both sound like hell but smaller maps with defined lanes a reasonable cover are just plain better
U get more kills on maps such as shoot house shipment and rust
I prefer a blend of both. No need to just pick between extremes
We need both. Variety is the key.
How do I fix this error? I have had it for 2 months and Activision support doesn't feel like helping.
Go to Actvision support feedback modern warfare. They will ask you for dev error (if you had any)
did you undervold you CPU ?
"Did you overclock your gpu?, is it the latest graphics driver?"
For me this happens when my recorder screws with thing

Kinda a biased place to post this
"Facts, but there might be some people here who really like Cold War nothing wrong with that."
It would be MW for a while but they take out STS and make my game freeze all the time so CW it is
Cold War is crap and I don�t know why they had to ruin mw with its realise
You should get negative Xp for playing multiplayer in cold war and you should get 3 times the xp In zombs. Multi bad. Zombs good.

Modern Warfare broke in the recent update. This is part of it.
"Yep, been happening since beginning.  It�s weird, doesn�t happen early in the morning but at night oh yeah crash central"
"There are NUMEROUS operators (the majority actually) that got surprise skin missions with the latest patch. None of them are doable, it's a visual bug basically. You can spray downtown all you want, nothing will happen."
Check my post https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/ldqa2g/ronin_operator_skin_challenges_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
"Its a new skin that you can�t unlock yet. Its from Black Ops season 1. Rumor had it, it was coming in a mid season update but no one knows exactly anymore."
I have the same issue. What a great time to get back to MW after a long break. Giant bugged update? Just like old times
Are any of you getting xp again? I�m getting pissed. I was trying to get platinum on the cr-56 Amax and I�m stuck now. Cant even level up classes I rarely use.
It�s the new patch it detects h*m*se*ualift in players and then disables xp gains for them till next patch
Wth do you mean by hmse*ualift?
"what is hmse\*ualift ? How do you know ""until next patch"" without any confirmation from the developers?"
Have they said when they plan to patch the issue? I really hope we can get like back logged exp lol!
I know this is a dumb question but are the guns fully upgraded?
"They are not, haha."
Nobody is. Its bugged since last Friday at least. I still get camo unlocks though so not sure why your aren't. No XP whatsoever though.
I�ve been getting camo unlocks for camo classes that were already unlocked but weapon xp is needed to unlock certain camo classes. So I�ve got all camos in all classes up to Tiger but stripes won�t unlock because my gun has to be level 54 or something like that.
"No one is. It's been broken since Friday. No communication regarding this from Activision, Infinity Ward or Raven."
I have the same problem. I was getting at least 90+ frames and since yesterday my frames have been dropping to around 40
"DUDE. Stay tuned and hopefully someone posts an answer to our worries. I'm sick of this nonsense, especially since it's so inconsistent."
same. seems like i get weird stutters like every 3 seconds
"Install and run DDU which will remove any video drivers.

It'll reboot into safe mode and do its thing.

When you're back into Windows proper, manually install your new video drivers from scratch.

Worked for me in the past (will it work this time though)."
"Well, you are officially my hero, since that fixed the flickering. Next step is determining the FPS drop issue..."
"The screen flicker is probably related to gsync being out of range for your monitor, the low frames would not be because of your monitor"
"I know the FPS issue isn't from the monitor, that was more so my idea for the flicker.

I did a DDU/fresh driver install and it got rid of the flicker.

What do you mean by the G-sync being out of range?"
Did you not earn some coins or something?
"Problem with Battle Pass...  Just not going to get in to it, disgusted at Activision's dismissive stance to customers."
"There's another menu, where you can mute all except party etc, maybe check in there?"
Where at?
That can also happen if u don�t have a good connection to them
I had to go into settings one time
Where at in settings?
I think in audio or general settings.
hopefully the patch goes live this thursday night. or earlier if possible
is that an assumption? why thursday? genuine question
"About time...  
They should compensate us for this. I want a shitton of Weapon double-XP tokens!"
"Haha is doubt they�ll give us that, but it definitely would be nice"
finaly a respond
Oh thank God
FYI: this is not my tweet in the pic
"Most infuriating glitch I've ever seen in a game, and it's been around for over a year?? These devs are shit and they don't give a fuck about the game. Sorry, just mad that I've been running around without attachments on my gun for 30 levels."
"Yeah, I�m really trying to level up my jak12 and nothing counts. It�s okay man, it�s safe to say pretty much all of us are really pissed, especially with the lack of communication"
Anyone know if the camo grind is tracking? Gonna try some over the next few days.
"You can unlock camos within a category, as long as you get the kills. It just takes a hell of a long time to unlock the next category."
If the weapon is max level I don�t think you will have a problem.
"The fact they won't address this until next update is beyond annoying. 

They don't even care about Modern Warfare anymore."
"Agreed, which really sucks. I did just see them reply to some people saying they have the team working on a fix right now that addresses some of the issues we�ve all had. But we�ll see what they actually mean."
They shouldve just reverted the patch as soon as they noticed the game was broken tbh
"I agree, this could have gone much smoother had they just backpedaled and then started the patch over and let us do our thing."
I am also no longer shadowbanned! So that problem is being fixed as well.
When did u get shadow banned bud?
"Same here! I kept ending up in other region servers, and that was if I was lucky."
it�ll probably come out as a hot fix so expect it anytime
My VSS is stuck on 1 level and I've played over 10 matches.  So obnoxious
Hopfully they  will add SHot the ship back in as a a sorry for fucking up
They should look into the shadowbans ffs. Not a word on that.
"They refused to address anything with this game and the update unless with WZ. Even though they got tons of tweets, Reddit posts and feedback. This is the first time I�ve even seen them mention there�s a game issue and that it�s not the customers"
How the hell is your sensitivity so damn high yet your ADS is butter smooth?
He's playing on PC...
"Playing on PC, once you get to a comfortable DPI it's pretty easy :)"
It�s very visible that you were panicking
It's cool but I think it should be posted on r/warzoneclips or r/warzoneLFG
Niceeee!
Thanks!

"I highly recommend you do not buy the game right now. It's currently broken and has been for 4 days. There is no XP nor progression. You will be stuck with all default weapons and no way to level them up or obtain any attachments. 

There has been zero communication from Activision, Infinity Ward, or Raven Software ( I heard they were taking over support for MW as well) regarding this issue. This despite the 100's of posts on the Activision official forums, Twitter and Reddit."
Nice of them to put it on sale right before they broke it.
"In my experience, the multiplayer is really sweaty in part because of SBMM. Now we can go on and on about this and weather it�s a good thing or not but I�m joys going to say what I think: I understand why it was done but I would sacrifice my firstborn to have it removed. But if you�re the kind of guy that doesn�t matter getting into a match and getting your ass kicked by some guy in rainbow colors wielding a kar98k who probably chugged about 4 monsters and 3 adderall before logging on then you�ll have a grand time, mechanically the game is fantastic. Not without issues but the gunplay is great. That�s my take at least"
Please tell me u had kill chain on
no
Holy shit that�s insane considering it�s not groundwar
"Nice! Most of the time I end up killing myself, even though I put the marker so far away"
Did you carpet bomb the whole map? Lol
Describes exactly how so many people play this game :( sitting somewhere like ... ( fill in whatever you want ) Camp of Duty
oof
Only 7?
volt 0kill for me
Holy fuck and how 7 10v10?
New patch bug. No one knows for sure whats going on since last Thursday�s patch. No word from any of the Devs at the moment either.
"oof... well, I hope that they'll let us have these operator challenges for free or something lol, I've spent a lot of matches trying to get certain skins"
Still broken. No communication from developers.
"Other than the operator swapping glitch being fixed,  nothing has changed."
"Still bugged. No XP gained, bad FPS, shadowbans, no que and more."
Yup I still can't gain any xp
"Can�t level up guns at the moment, it�s a bug. It really sucks tbh."
"I haven�t getting that bug i saw many people in other regions get it but i saw no one complain in south korea 
We only complain about china"
"I had an error when launching the game from battlenet. It said my OS version was too old and I didnt have dx 12. If you have the same error you can try :

Make sure battlenet is closed - Find battlenet.exe - go to propeties - uncheck ( compatible with win 8 ) - check run as administrator- open up battlenet and launch the game."
Apparently just restarting the game 6 or 7 times fixed the issue fffffffff
Nice aimbot
What in the aimbot is this ? *REPORTED*
"This is an aimbot. 

People posting aimbot clips and thinking they can sell it as legit aim is getting old..."
"it's not you can even see if you look close that I had to make a micro adjustment because I did not hit the flick completely. Learn to do consistent 180s, learn where people spawn, pre aim popular corners/angles you will hit some crazy shots if you do it enough."
Has mw multiplayer actually changed at all since cw? For me it�s the same.
"The actual gameplay is still the same, just the menus and stuff advertise CW pretty heavily"
"Same. Though the advertising is annoying it hasn�t changed the game for me. I get quick lobbies. This has the feeling of a karma farm. MW good, CW bad, please upvote me."
Just the typical group of people who complain about having the new game shoved in their faces. The modern warfare game and multi-player have not changed yet.
Nothing changed.
"More lag, worse lag than S0 and S2.  If you're on PC more instances of cheaters.  Also the MP was much more balanced and the map pool better before S6's abs dumpsterfire of a patch."
It's a lot harder to find games in OCE. Anything past 2am is a bust. I've stopped soloqueueing pretty much altogether because of the queue times (and a matchmaking system which specifically kills smaller regions)
My only beef is too much aniyah palace otherwise the Cold War advertising is merely an annoyance.
Yeah they took away the ability to gain any weapon xp for 90% of the players. It�s super cool.
No new real content through a season pass was what killed it for me.
"My weapons won't level no matter how many kills I get. I assume it's a bug, but until it's fixed I don't find the game worth playing."
Well and this last Update that broke the game ... well there's that too.
"hitmarkers and reticles dont work properly so nope, to me its not the same game."
"lol, no it hasn�t. People just like to bitch for karma. Even the complaints about the ads are kinda dumb. So the title screen offers you wz, mw, or black ops. The horror! And then the store offers you ads for bundles, just like they did for MW."
"Yes, it is now full of gamebreaking bugs that hinder the user's experience. You don't earn XP, hitmarkers aren't registering, the menus are slower, the UI was changed and looks nothing like pre-CW."
It might just be me but it does feel a little clunkier these days.
"For me MW multiplayer has changed a lot. I have a suboptimal AMD card and since the Cold War update I�ve been getting massive stuttering issues in war zone and even MW multiplayer (to a lesser extent, but still annoying af). I don�t know what it is but I get massive FPS drops from 80 down to 50 when there�s too much onscreen. Never was an issue before and I�ve checked all other possibilities (like freesync settings, monitor issues, even changing advanced options in MW document). It�s kind of ruined the MW multiplayer and war zone experience for me, and it seems the only solution is to �buy a better GPU� :("
For me it�s recently become significantly worse. Terrible lag has been making it very frustrating to play and I know it�s not my connection because all my other games are running very smoothly
"Maybe OP means this realtime ingame manipulation got implemented which they patented back in 2017, that you can even measure in botgames where you put them on any difficulty and at some point when your score too high you literally die to one bullet of an SMG into the leg and they suddenly get better too even if recruit, while you get hitmarkers with your 50. cal quickscoping them enemies. Or if you got multiple enemy bots the algorithm just starts to spawn 5 of them in behind your arse for balancing purposes.

Don't know if this realtime ""Balancing"" was implemented before too. But maybe that is so subtle that you and others may not have felt it while the OP did.

Personally besides that, which is kinda annoying but not yet TOO annoying, I only figured that every few games I teleport around the map a few seconds with a ping of 30ms lol"
All I know every game there are connection issues now with the servers on MW. Not sure what the issue is since the last update. Is anyone else dealing with this? My Latency is 32ms so latency is not the issue. I have fiber internet.
Yea I thought i was going crazy or that my internet was broken but every game is laggy now. Ping sky rocketing to 600+ for a few seconds every match when usually I�m at 40-70ish at most. My guess is that either something in the update is fucking up connection or they�ve reduced the number of servers active by a dramatic amount
"Same here. Massive packet loss whenever I join a game. Only MW gives me this issue and only in the last few weeks. I have uninstalled and abandoned it now, just too unplayable."
"Somebody just really fucked up with that last update. I don't play WZ so i had to download 11gb on a 5mbit connection for literally just ruining the game. Shoot the ship is gone and netcode and hitmarks seem to be more fucked up like ever before.

Edit: ...and are they serious about not fixing this immediately? lol"
"Same issue with me, ever since CW release, massive lag spikes randomly even though my ping is about 40 and about 40% of matches I play I get booted out because of 'connection issues'. Absolute freakin joke for a AAA game tbh."
They shadowbanned a ton of people on MW last update. Mine finally went away yesterday. This is what you�re experiencing most likely
I have been experiencing this a lot I get severe packet loss to the point where it'll take 5 minutes to turn around. I did turn off texture streaming last night and it seemed to fix it.
I saw a comment saying ethernet fixes it. But haven't tried it out.
"I joined 2 weeks before season 2 ended and I got to witness everything that came after that, and I gotta say, MW 2019 was a good CoD to me for the most part. Warzone was good, and now it's almost getting Axed, Multiplayer was fun. I can only enjoy the campaign for Cold War and it's Zombies. This sentiment is something I feel and 100% agree with you on. Hopefully CW becomes better, and hopefully Activision can let this came thrive on its own, but God damn do I hate it when you can't realize when you're in the good ol' days before you leave them"
"Well, IW is probably working on a new project now. This is what happens when the product is annual"
"The product being annual is fucking bullshit.

They made a gem and replaced it with a rock. It wasn't a perfect diamond, but it was still a fucking gem of a game."
"Even with annual release previous cods got updates long after their cycle, it�s never been like this"
"We just bought MW about a month and a half ago, and CW two weeks ago because one of my husband's buddy's buddies has CW instead of MW for when they want to jam MP rather than WZ.

I haven't played a CoD since BlOps III was in Humble Bundle, but I greatly prefer MW over CW for its mechanics and aesthetic.  

&#x200B;

I'm really freaking confused though, the current Battle Pass is only for WZ/CW content, right? The most annoying part of CW content boosting is that it's a completely different game from MW, doesn't even make sense for them to be throwing one under the bus in favor of the other because they're really not even in the same league to be competing with each other."
"I dont get why pass stuff like stickers and watches and reticules at least aren't given in MW.

Plus the Mac-10 and Groza would make perfect sense if added and rebalanced for MW."
cold war is terrible compared to MW 2019 and I can say Imo MW 2019 is in my top 5 CoDs of all time. it was refreshing and GOOD. fun. cold war died for me a month in maybe even weeks.
I can�t stand multiplayer in general anymore but MW2019 got me through the lockdown last year when I bought my first PS4 - first gaming console since PS2. It�s sad to see such a great game go down the drain a little after a year since release.
I like cold war more tbh. The maps are relatively good and the ttk is good. Also the game looks beautiful even if it isn't as good as mw. Also zombies is miles better than spec ops
"> MW19 top 5 CoDs of all time

bruh"
"MW 2019 is hands down the best CoD game, but has the worst maps by far. So many safe spaces for shit players/campers, and zero flow."
wrong
[deleted]
"I don�t think I will buy another COD game again, I feel like I payed too much for such a short life game (battlepass-wise and stuff), I wanted a complete Modern Warfare game, not the publicity for the next game"
You can always go back to playing Modern Warfare
"Yeah, I don't understand this. I alternate between the two depending on what I feel like playing. It's not like the option isn't there."
"Advertises are one thing, since merge with cold war, MW split screen is unplayable, I�ve been playing MW with my GF very often before, now we�re getting tons of crashes, if only cold war split screen worked properly...literally fuck this"
"i jumped off COD after ghosts and came back to mw2019 and it was a breath of fresh air to say the least. it felt like the mw games of last gen got revamped mechanically and graphically to keep up with modern games while still keeping that arcade-ish feel that COD's always had as far as gameplay mechanics that are basic in nature, but mastery allows for insane gameplay and i loved it. haven't played for a few months now but i'm thinking of getting whichever mw instalment is next if it looks good."
"I played modern warfare for about 4 months until i realized the only maps i played were shoothouse and shipment, and all the other maps were just unenjoyable and too big (i play ffa) Was probably the least fun i have ever had in a call of duty game what with the sbmm. Never uninstalled a call of duty game mid life cycle until this game"
My biggest pet peeve is when I load up a game and the first option is NOT THE FUCKING GAME I LOADED
I miss pre warzone multiplayer
You miss a time when the only difference was that there were less maps and guns available?
"I never played CoD that much besides the main campaign but really loved the Shoot the Ship playlist. That's exactly what I want, chaos and mayhem, respawning immediatly, multi kills, hectic gameplay. Now I'm playing normal quick play and frankly, am very bored."
"100% agree... I�ve been getting errors and bugs that I�ve never gotten the entire year of MW. My fear for IWs next title, which I�m pretty sure will be another MW title, is not that IW won�t listen, it�s that Activision won�t allow them to implement the things we want or beg for. I believe Activision is forcing the studios involved with COD to do the things that make money over the things that fans want. I know there�s a balance in that, but still. IMO, IW delivered a really solid COD game with MW2019 and I feel like they would�ve fixed a lot more if they would�ve been given the autonomy to do so. At the end of the day, I feel like IW would rather make a game that absolutely resonates within the fan base, than prioritize micro transactions and SBMM systems to attract new players. I feel like those are more Activision telling/requiring the dev studios to do. But I guess we will see. I don�t have much trust or expectations anymore. They�re slowly running COD Mobile as well. And scold War, even being fun to play, is just a joke and a error/bug filled, unfinished, unoptimized, underdeveloped, underwhelming game... I have never in my life had so many hard crashes with my One X as I have with Cold War... constant errors, download issues, bugs, lag/stuttering, and just constant issues. And the content is just so lackluster that it�s not even worth overlooking all the issues. 

I think that a lot of the COD community are picky, never gonna be pleased, entitled whiners, but CW and the way that Activision is treating MW is just disgusting... I have purchased a ton of games, and I�ve never felt so scummy for spending $70 on a game until CW. Zombies is what�s worth booting that retarded game up for me, but even then, I�m having errors and hard crashes more often than I�d like. I just worry that if this nasty, scummy practice that Activision is forcing on their devs isn�t challenged and checked, it�s not gonna be long before COD is gonna be back where it was before MW. MW19 was the light at the end of the tunnel for me and for the first time in a long time, I enjoyed COD. But I guess we will see with time... either way, I�m fully expecting BF6 to massively eclipse and destroy COD release this year, UNLESS they nail this next title. Pretty much the thing that would do it for me is if IW releases the next MW game. Anyways... that�s just my rant."
"Yeah, MW wasn�t too bad, I wish I could�ve enjoyed it more during its prime. I simply didn�t have time to play it much, and when I did it was with my buddy, but he only played 6v6 TDM, which is probably the worst thing you could play on this game. I would say at least 25-30% of my games ended in a time limit. Really made me hate the game, wasn�t until I decided to solo for a bit and discovered that 10v10 mosh pit on the right maps was soooo much better."
"up until MW I mostly played TDM and FFA, but thanks to friends in MW I only played 10v10, SnD, and ground war. Honestly haven't had this much fun since bo1/bf3 days."
I miss the dedicated 10 V 10 domination lobby.
If COD ever realizes to stick with one good game for awhile they could make a ton of money. Look at Destiny. Why not just make new seasons and new map packs. Hell I�d be happy to pay for new maps on MW. If they brought back Terminal here�s my money. They coulda made a ton of money on Christmas themed packs.  I put so much money into battle passes and packs and then one day ok we�re gonna stop with all that. Wtf. It�s a terrible business model and why people get burned out on COD. And it�s why I�ll NEVER buy CW no matter how much I wanna try zombies. Screw that.
It's pretty fucked up at the moment and i don't know why cause they're only updating warzone/ cold war
The realism community is still as small as it ever was. We will be loyal to MW
"Yeah I like the night maps, too bad it's not a permanent mode."
"I don't know if it's true but I was told that they used the same base engine they used for every single game since 2007 to make Cold War, and if that's true not only they took away from us a refreshing game, that would mean they gave us the same game they've been giving us since 2007 with 2020 prices. 

But, seriously, I'm not sure if this is completely true, but it does feel like a regular COD from 2007-2017."
Cold war being smashed in my face is annoying and MW seems to lag way more now for some reason.
"Other than the matchmaking and spawns, best MP in the series IMO"
"It does feel differently. But soooo many hackers especially at international airport in the walls and under the ground. 

Yeah *SLIM JESUS* I'm talking about you. Get dick cancer you fuck."
True.
"I've lost all my trust in Activision, hate me all you want but it is what it is."
"Im actually enjoying more since cw released. Im not a professional, play occasionally on weekends when there time, and it seems to me match making has gotten more fair since cw release. All the hardcores jumped ship to go to cw now its just average, or below, players like me"
"get an aim trainer, just play it for 15-20 mins a day if you can and you'll be above average within a month."
"Battlefield 6 has my attention right now, it seems more like an FPS much like MW with a lot more depth and takes the spotlight away from Cold War."
"There is very little officially known about BF6 yet, other than it's slated to release around the holiday season."
"I just got back on since Cold War came out, and realized my rank was set back to 1:( I was proud of my 56. It was the highest I had gotten in CoD before."
Another reason I don't like the new ranks. Level 155 felt nice compared to the grind fest of getting to 1000.
"The map packs suck now for sure since the last update, if I play all I can stand to get on is warzone. And I�ve also been incredibly irritated by the amount of Ads for CW that have been shoved in my face, when I item I paid for is made by a different developer. I personally have always hated treyarch and loved infinity ward. But this shit is out of hand"
"Lets all have a moment of silence, I also feel the type of players changed a bit too."
I agree looking at generic zombie Russian bad guy is agonizing while booting up a game with way cooler characters/operators but the gameplay is still what it was at its peak. The map rotation is different but my crew made the jump back after about 2 months of Cold War. Hoping more guns come to MW
"I agree, man"
Most fun I�ve had on cod in a while. Tried to play the other day and just didn�t feel the Same
"Really had minimal interest in mw mp, played s&d until warzone came out, then cw came out still enjoyed warzone with the new guns. Couple glitches to deal with dmr 2 shots, wall hack, stim glitch. However after the recent update or 2 ago the connection issue sre absolutely terrible!"
"Everything seems the same to me, but the quality of competition has gone down imo.  Hard to find a game in MW where both teams are playing the objective."
"I'm hoping with the next mw game Iw listens a little more to what the community wants in terms of maps and weapons. A ton of people wanted stuff like Highrise, Afghan, and Estate, and instead they gave us maps like that docks map from season 5 which many people hated(can't remember the name atm) that is a remake of a cod 2 map, and hardhat. I'm just going to say it how it is, no one(at least to my knowledge)wanted that cod 2 map remade and that no one wanted hardhat."
The game is literally the same
"�Unplayable.� Gimme a break. 

You know what? Don�t play it, more for us!"
Its so easy to ignore all the CW stuff. Im not sure why this is such a problem that requires multiple posts on it.
"Did they change a marker when you get a kill in MW Multiplayer? 

I just got on after a little while and getting a kill doesn�t feel quite as satisfying. Like the marker is different or a sound changed."
Start playing PUBG the gun play is much better than anything on MW
"i may be strange but i prefer hardpoint and dom on cw when i want to chill

For SnD i prefer mw though and play this most of the time"
"I miss how much me and my friends played MW, it was like the old cod days we had a full team for S&D. But once we tried BOCW they played for a while then went back to WOW...now I barley talk to them."
"The menu is a lot slower and buggier since they implement a clutter of ui elements related to Cold War (I don�t care about the game) in Modern Warfare, at least for old gen consoles."
"With a new warzone map, addition of a few new guns, and the plenty of options they had for good maps to remake, this game could have easily lasted another year. They would still be making bank off microtransactions, now more than half the people I used to play with have given up on the game."
Cold War sucks :(
i had to delete mw i cant handle the lag ever since i got cold war it was a sad day for me
I guess this is an unpopular opinion but MW sucked. It was not a fun game.
r/modernwarfare when they havent gone 20 minutes without trashing cold war
Ah man I am so with you on this seriously.
Me too!! So much!
"Call of duty cycle 

New game hype > mp is bad > nostalgic for the old game mp > new game hype > mp is bad > nostalgic for the old game mp > repeat"
"The hacks are crazy at times. The main one for me actually was during MW MP and it was TDM with dude on other team had a chopper in air within 30 seconds. And had VTOL at least 3 times in that match alone. It was way unplayable. How do hacks like that make the game fun?!! Jus play the game as is. Not like it�s an infinite ammo or some shit like that. Wall hacks and crap like that needs to go. Don�t like playing with PC players cuz of that. Nothing against PC players since the larger portion of that base doesn�t hack but still. Gives them a bad name. CW at times is ridiculous as well. I usually jus play that MP to level up weapons, other than that I�m usually on Warzone or MW MP. Hope next one is MW2."
unplayable lol
Season 3 was peak Modern Warfare
gears 5 is free with gold thats where im chilling between mw rounds
"im gonna give the MP a try, thank you."
Is Gears 5 first-person?
Apex is fun but its a battle royale
I love cod mw warzone and Cold War I mostly only play shooters I own Xbox series x and os4 not sure what system your on but on Xbox gears series is awesome all the halos battlefield 4 and 5 those are all on game pass I no you don�t like cartoons but apex is awesome fortnite is to if you give it a chance on play station not really any of there exclusives are shooters like cods so mostly the same games I listed unless you have the ps now it has black ops 3 on it rn I think
"Thank you so much, i have Xbox one S. I have Gamepass and EA play.

As fortnite i dont like the Cartoonish it is, and as apex i like the graphic, but its BR thats why i dont like to play it.

Probably im gonna try Gears 5 MP. Thank you so much for ur suggestions."
Hired Ops? Free on steam
"i got xbox, cant use steam, but thank you anyway."
You could always try mobile. Not my cup of tea but it has some classic maps
"ea play has the battlefield series so maybe try battlefield 4, it has a similar theme to MW"
"Thank you for suggestion, i like BF4 but its a bit old (Graphic, Design, System..) but im gonna give it a try if GEARS 5 wont work for me."
"Probably try Warface (NOT Warface Breakout) if you're looking for a f2p cod-like MP shooter w/ gun customization. 

Can get pretty heavy on microtransactions though."
"I saw bunch of videos about it, the whole system seems very good, but the graphic really disappointed me.  Though its not the game fault, its just when you play MW, not every game (or better i say no other game) can satisfy you, at least at graphic design. Which to be fair MW is near 200 GB, Warface is 12."
But you can level up your guns in Warzone...
"Yes, thank you for suggestion, but tbh i don't like WZ, specially now cuz it filled with OP guns from CW and i already have all guns damascus, i need 15 kills per match to get obsidian which if i play plunder it took forever. Beside i like fast paced games, WZ is bit boring for me."
Mad I said the n****r word lmaoo
Bunch of ass holes. Sorry you have to deal with that man. That�s why I keep voice chat muted.
The pulp fiction lines in the office were my favorite. Why do they get so angry when you call them out?
Yeah Cold War is ass
"Ah yes, Cold War bad modern warfare good. I�ve never seen a unique post like this here."
"Its all personal preference, i prefer treyarchs fast paced gameplay over MW slow clunky feeling. Only really playing mw again for ground war since battlefield 1 and V were disappointments to me. I prefer the big game modes."
True I love some ground war except the one map idk the name but there�s just a straight line point a to the last point you can go wide or anything it feels so restricting other then that I love ground war
Battlefield 1 and 5 are amazing lmao
"Oh look another post about how cw sucks and MW is the best. 

Its as if the sub is an echo chamber."
Oh look another bitch complaining about a post he doesn�t even have to be reading...
I brought Black Ops4 when it was launched.. it was worst mistake of my life so that day i decided not to buy game from Treyarch.. now im happy i didn't brought CW.. currently MW 19 is best compare to CW
"I'm gonna hardscope the whole fuckin match if I want to. Name call all you want, I've been playing since MW2 and 1 thing I've learned is people gonna talk shit no matter how you play. Besides, ""winning"" in cod is not as fun for me as pissing people off, so that's my goal.

Let the downvotes rain on me!"
"You sir get an upvote. We all despise the campers and the positioned hardscoper, but at the end of the day you deal with it you op pussy"
Hardscopers are better than quickscopers
By this logic I�m going to use the Fennec across verdansk on single fire only.
It�s a sniper. People don�t quick scope in real life. Sorry we�re not sweaty try hards looking to make a clip that�ll make us cum every time we watch it.
"You realize that sniper rifles are made for longe range combat and not 360 quickscopes or whatever, please try quickscoping an enemy when you get drafted to Afghanistan or something. TIL OP is a narcissistic asswipe who doesn't know how sniper rifles work"
Op is entertained by sparklers and kinder eggs
If u are trying to level up mw guns do co op mission strong box and kill the enemy npcs and turn on 2xp weapon and that should help u level up guns
"Experiencing the same thing, no clue"
"AFAIK it's a pretty common I curing bug since the last update, unfortunately to my knowledge there is not currently a known fix


(although knowing activision it's probably intentional to drive people to cold war for more profits)"
"no they are leveling, just extremely slow as fuck"
"Honestly who knows when anything will be fixed, they don�t communicate so it�s a waiting game I guess. Definitely sucks."
For sure. It�s the only COD I�ve really been able to enjoy since BO2/Ghosts. Then they fuck us.
"Patch 1.31 hit this game. Not a lot of stuff works right. Honestly I think Activision is actively trying to kill MW to sell more CW. I still think they are doing everything they can to make a mess of MW just to prove CW isn�t a steaming pile of crap.

MW server repairs coming in patch 1.32. See below. 

[MW server repairs. ](https://youtu.be/JPxPA2sAf_0)"
"Thanks. I agree, what�s happening to this game kills me, the potential is unreal."
They can do many I am staying with MW all day I will not leave anytime soon
it's actually insane how a patch for WARZONE can break all multiplayer features -\_- IW pls
Speaking of the problems Sence the update does anyone have terriable loading issues on the game now like loading in to a ground war match it takes forever objects don�t load game looks terriable and when in the menus trying to do load outs and stuff it takes ages to load things is anyone else having things like that or just me?
Yea some dude was saying that�s a symptom of being shadow banned idk how but it�s fucked either way
"I had this for 3 days and it went away today, I�m like 90% I was shadow-banned because almost all my games had cheaters in it. This could be your problem as well."
"simple, they are making MW crash more so people can buy Cold War /s"
I've gotten nothing but dev errors for the week prior to my putting the game down (last week). I'll come back in a month to MW/WZ but I don't expect much unfortunately.
"Have they even addressed the issues? Or Responded to any complaints (via Twitter, official msg boards etc.)"
"Just don�t play it till they fix it.

I actually wanted to play tonight, but I�m not gonna download 80GIGs of a garbage update that will will have to re-do next week. My ISP will get all over my ass or some shit. 

Just wait till they fix their shit."
Its bugged by our fav indie game company. It crashes cause when someone picks up a care package it just crashes somehow
I managed to get 85 kills on port and when someone finally killed me the entire server crashed.
4 straight games in the past 20 minutes
"After resent update, I noticed that I'm not earning any XP either. There's just a huge bug that needs to be fixed."
I looked it up on this sub and it seems its just not getting ficed right now...

Same bullshit. The only game this happens on
someone definitely works at CISCO and knows what he is talking about
"I wish I worked at CISCO, however all of my network knowledge is self taught over many years, Came in handy when I was on ADSL with the constant issues of High resistance faults etc, was able to help the ISP whom I'm still with get the Network Infrastructure people to finally fix the issue rather then temp fixes, which took years only to prove them right when they decided to out FTTC in and placed a new cabinet where I suggested, no more issues anymore like I told them would be the case.

The last time I did a CISCO course was when I was doing work placement when I was in college so I could help networking a school. It was a refresher course on how to terminate networks, make cable runs and crimping.


Now an Update, since the latest update the packet loss issue although still present in some matches it's not as bad, but it's now a few matches in before I hit a packet loss server then after that it's fine again for a bit."
Graphics look fine to me
Graphics look fine to me
I�ve been able to unlock camos for the gun but not level it up. I would have had gold by now if it wasn�t for this bug because the skulls category Isn�t unlocked until gun level 55
I�m not sure about this but I heard that if you play a game of double xp plunder then It might fix it. It might not but it�s worth a shot
"Its proven if you uninstall and reinstall 3 times in a row, it fixes this glitch. Youre welcome."
I heard it was 7x
"You know you should've linked your og activision acc with your psn

i don't think you can do much besides waiting for support

edit:wait, you could maybe sign in with the old acc and have your stuff back since the platform is the same"
"the thing is i dont think i had an account, maybe I did and i just forgot/didnt know

also if that was the case, why wasnt my account still linked?"
"If you haven�t played for a long time, everybody got reset to Level 1 when MW merged with Cold War and they introduced the cross-game progression. 

And XP is broken as of the 1.31 update on Friday so that�s why you�re not leveling up"
no XP (level + Weapons) in multiplayer MW (PS4) and no tab slider in Multiplayer menu !!! FIX QUIKLY PLEASE
Yes! This is exactly what I'm talking about
Other users on this topic said it..
Yeah there's no XP right now. Been this way since at least Friday.
Just started for me today
I�ve had this for a week. I�m still getting xp for my guns though not my actual level. Really throwing me off gameplay wise.
"I�ve been waiting for it since Halloween, haven�t seen it since. I heard it won�t be back but could be wrong but I haven�t seen it since Halloween unfortunately."
Same :/ hopefully it comes back. I�ve seen people on the sub saying that it�s in their shop but
No you missed it it was a limited time thing. Also I doubt it would return since it was a collab
"Think it was only out during Halloween

Edit: what�s your gamer tag? I can make sure you get to the tracers up close mwhahahaha"
Terrible banter that
This has been an issue with me since the end of last week
ok thanks
"It�s a bug since the last update, it�s only happening in multiplayer. I believe it�s working in warzone, such a shame"
ok glad it�s not just me

"This. I play the game to unwind for an hour or so just blasting on the smaller maps, shoot the rusty ship as 24/7 would be my ideal playlist as the maps are good and small and is just mindless fun. It�s a very anti consumer move to not have a map select or server browser in 2021"
"I knew they took out Shoot The Ship but I still like Infected and what better way to play it than with Re-Infected Groundwar and trolling with my mic, thing is that the stupid mode keeps crashing on me, it did it 2x so I just said fuck it! And went to play another game, it�s ridiculous. If IW is not gonna update the game anymore then they should just leave it alone on a stable version instead of anchoring it to WZ & Cold War buggy updates. Fucking pathetic. But of course, like all huge corporations - they are too big to fail despite treating us like shit."
Come to Gunfight man. 6x6 and 10x10 multiplayer was killing me. I've been having a blast with Free For All and Gunfight 2x2.
"If you only play shoot the ship, the game isn't the problem. You are"
It is if these maps are he only good ones
"Closest thing I can think of is a SevenFriday watch. 

Although I wouldn�t recommend buying one. Not exactly a well respected brand in the watch world."
"I had this. Theres load of suggested fixes online, the one that worked for me last week was to go in offline mode (if on PS4 press the middle big button, or when it starts up with ""loading online services"" hit cancel to go offline) and then enter that way. 

When you get into viewing the data packs, it will suddenly say one of them isn't installed (for me it was special ops data pack 1) even though it previously had said installed. Click to go to store and it will show a download, I think it was 11GB for me? Something like that? The add on doesn't show in the store any other way but somehow it pops up going through this offline route. Installed, restarted and was able to play fine.

Well, aside from the major glitches their update brought last week like no XP awarded but thats another thing...."
Ive the same issue with multiplayer. It happend when i switched TVs
Clean your room dude
"Literally got the same issue. Wanted to enable this more especially with the hacker situation but can�t get past this bit, it�s ridiculous.."
"my xp was wack in shoot the ship as well

sometimes i was getting normal xp at start, then 10-20 or nothing after a while, sometimes i got 10-20 or nada the whole game"
"not sure if you�re talking about the same thing, but they nerfed the xp gain when playing shipment to make it more in-line with gun leveling progress in CW so there wouldn�t be such a big discrepancy for WZ"
Well the best fix it fast boys because Cold War is absolute DOG SHIT such a step back from MW2019
"Yeah I feel like an asshole for buying it but I had to see for myself a while back. I just looked through the attachments and what they did, and I was like �Yeah this is all rushed as fuck.� Its garbage"
"I had actually bought Cold War before I had played modern warfare and I thought it was pretty fun, but then I ended up buying Modern warfare bc that�s what all my friends were playing and I was blown away. I really hope they fix this soon"
"I think you probably nailed it. Other than something malicious this makes the most sense. Curious to see how long they take to fix and if they do anything to make up for the mistake. I�m thinking 2xp 15 minutes only useable in Cold War. 

For other commenter: As far as XP losses during the two weeks of shoot the ship, XP reduced as kills increased. Many players getting double/triple normal kill counts per match and doing it all day for two weeks - it was a fair compromise."
remember when it actually gave more xp than it was supposed to and they hotfixed that like in an hour.
"infected is not a new mode, it's been around for like a year with several other similar modes. And it doesn't say xp won't be affected, it says k/d win/loss stats etc aren't affected (since it's a fun mode). you still get XP there.

This is just a bug with Friday's big update. in fact, the update literally has over dozen major different bugs."
"My original guess was that they screwed up the modifier for the double XP weekend, but it looks like that's ended"
Is it fixed yet weapon n character xp?
"I think they just completely f'ed it up.  Cause there is so many problems other than XP, but the XP is the biggest one they got.  Of course there priority is on CW and warzone right now, so it might be a minute before they fix it, if they ever do."
"What really surprised me is on a quick search of Google News stories, I've yet to see one tech / gaming site that's picked up the massive issues of this patch as a story..I guess the game must be dead in the eyes of media and Activision since it's all media silence. Sigh.. guess it's time to move on to a non-activision title."
Night mode was criminally underrated and the fact BLACK ops has no night maps or modes is another sign that treyarch half-assed the game.
Big facts!
"Well even if they did night maps, it wouldn't be the same. The current gear didn't exist during the cold war. The night vision would be shit, there'd be no IR lasers or IR illuminators. What am I saying though, cold war doesn't even really try to be realistic with the gear on the weapons. Players would still notice though"
Cool stuff
Thanks!
What would the requirement be to unlock this?
"Oh! Um... Maybe, �Get 3 Headshots in 1 minute in 7 different matches�"
It does it to me on single screen. It�s stupid
Never happened before. Started happening after the update. Absolutely terrible!
"Oh, CoD added a Cyberpunk 2077 easter egg! That's cute :D"
Been happening since Thursday :(
No way! That makes it even worse... Nearly a week and no fix...
"You likely got shadowbanned and put into lobby with other suspected cheaters. I�ve been playing since launch, never cheated, and now all my lobbies are 350+ ping. My kdr is so pathetically average that it�s clear that none of the bans got reviewed. This game was keeping me sane past few months and now I�m stuck in cheaters hell for no apparent reason. I hear it�s been happening to many people, even prominent streamers. Nothing to do but wait for the ban to lift. Sorry."
"My KDR is in no way suspicious. im grinding for demascus so the riot shield/launcher challenges brought me down to a 1.01. Im literally not sus at all, I play on console  and my headshot accuracy isn�t too special either. ive never hit some amazing or extraordinary shots that people would report me for. i don�t get it."
You probably pulled of some sweet shots & plays on a handful of potato kids a few to many times who reported you for hacking in combination with Activisions ass-class anti-cheat system which probably flagged you as sus and no much like Seto Kaiba you�ve been banished to the shadow realm.
Hi cheater I'm toxic. Kids with their labels are funny arent they?
Kayo
Oyak
okay
okay
What goes around *throws grenade* comes around *dies*
"'What comes around is all around, Lahey'"
"Even though I despise shoot house and shipment, it's the only game mode that gives me those good endorphins. I just finished 3/4 launchers for Damascus, and only need the riot shield. I'd rather chew glass than try to get them gold outside of shipment."
the only thing you got left is the riot shield? Hardcore is the only way to go.
Is shipment back?
Really amazing map needs to be a permanent playlist or activision is deliberately being mean to me pouty face :(
People cried over it and they got it
"Ready for the ""Your gay you use shotgun."" comments."
"Or someone crying about how you aren't supposed to use the shotgun on that map. They're kinda right, but I had dragons breath rounds to play with."
\*you're gay
"weak, mine was 7 deaths in a row"
"Dead ass I just want a 2 second spawn protection, 2 seconds"
#MAKE SHOOT THE SHIP PERMANENT!
"That's why I love shipment. It's the choas. There's a pattern to it. Once you see it. Oh, the bitter sweet vengeance you can dispense."
Would you mind explaining this pattern of doom?
Where you here when they first released shipment and hoe broken the spawn was? Especially in domination???
My favourite thing is when you�re spawned into your own cluster strike and get wiped for all the team kills.
Was? It still is broken
"Yes, and sometimes still is, but I recently started clipping and things like this make me remembered when I almost cried cause of the spawns before, too funny tho"
The map is like the size of a shoebox where do you want them to spawn you?
"This, shoot house and rust needs to be a permanent playlist WW2 had it permanent even before the next cod game came out and even though CW is out they still won�t cave. MW is the last cod I�ll buy, glad BF6 is out this year!"
Nah nah mate they got rid of shoot ship and they�ve got the apparent �fan favourite� mode back in. The dumb knives and pistol one which can�t say I�ve ever heard of before. IW really got a bunch of clowns running shit over there lol
It's the only map that gets my heart rate up consistently and has me go from happy to sad to thrilled to mad approximately every 2 seconds.
I miss shipment purely because of how fast your gun levels up
"Just remember, sometimes you get shit on on shipment and other times you're the one shitting on people on shipment. Lol"
Bring back shoot the ship!!! Best playlist MW ever had
Why did they take it away? It's the only reliable map for grinding the toughest camos.
Shoothouse is amazing to me but Shipment is an easy insta skip
"I never understood the hate for shotguns, can someone explain why?"
"�Boo hoo i didnt get a chance against the weapon that is designed for close range�

- The Haters"
"I see nothing wrong here

Typical shipment gameplay"
"Damn, I miss shoot the ship

Damn, I miss shipment 24/7

Damn, I miss I have rust issues

Damn, why the fuck can't they just give us what we want"
they want us to move to cold war
"Dude, one time I threw a grenade, died, and spawned where I threw it and died again"
I had to watch it twice to realize what happened.
"It may not be great, but damn shoot the ship has an impact on playing/grinding camos"
How did u get shipment what game mode
I played it in hardcore I was not aware shipment isn't in normal
"Dude, shipment spawning spots are soooooo crapy"
Nah its horrendous but I cant stop playing it

My best deaths in shipment were calling in a care package and then spawning inside of it twice.
I miss shipment. Playing CW so long now the controls on shipment feels so out of whack
"This sub is 3 things. Complaining about getting killed on hardcore shipment, complaining that shoot the ship/rusty houseboat aren't permanent playlists, or complaining about activision supporting cold war instead of MW"
"Everyone - Modern warfare is so fun!
Modern warfare:"
"Miss it already :,("
Genuinely why the f do people beg for this map. This is the experience 90% of the time
Why isn't there a permanent 24/7 shipment playlist!?
i think he is afk at the end because he just left the room
"Shipment is trash, all my homies hang out at azhir cave"
Shotgun user on Shipment. Deserved it...probably deserved it even more.
"bRiNg BaCk sHiPmEnT 24/7 

Me: �Hard no.�"
"Hard yes.

If you don�t like it, just choose a different mode."
Why do you guys play this shit?
Karma. You're using a shotgun. I don't feel any remorse for you whatsoever.
You deserve it for using a shotgun
"Ah yes, the shotgun. Big boogey man of players who haplessly run into close quarters fight while using their AR, which ofcourse is supposed to win all firefights all the time. 

Then they impotently use same tactic every time, hoping something would change instead of trying something else. And when they had enough, they cry about it on forums how their daddy AR can't win the fight in all ranges."

Didnt you bother to read a single post before posting this? It's kinda the only thing people have been posting about this weekend.
It�s a glitch
Contact the platform holder I.e xbox playstaion battlenet
Thanks
"Happened to me once before too, i just contacted PlayStation support and i managed to get the points into my account :) Hope you have the same support"
"same thing happen to me, unfortunately i wasn�t able to get my money back but for those who want to purchase cod in the future don�t buy modern warfare cod points get warzone or cold war cod points."
"Try restarting the game first. If that doesn't work, contact support."
"I requested a refund from Microsoft, thanks though."
Hate all that sparkly crap
I like watching my enemies explode into giblets and I�m sure it gets annoying to them. Signature kill from me (;
Love to see mw still active even tho activision tries to kill it
If it wasn't for so many mediocre maps and cheese guns it could be THE best cod.
"Who will win...5 idiots or 1 sweatyyyy boi

Just messing with you btw lol"
Well we all lost in the end haha
"Thats pretty much this whole game, whoever panics the fastest wins lol"
That�s my secret cap I�m always panicked
Good advice i'll keep but what was that ak setup i wanna try it
"No stock -
Spetz barrel -
Merc foregrip -
recoil grip

Was doing the mastery challenges so I was using 4 attachments and trying to get point blank headshots"
"My favourite kind of play style, and one i use quite often."
I have not seen that map in so long lmao
I'm a massive 10v10 player so I see it all the time. I just hate Dom on it. Anything else is pretty fun.
Im in panic mode in every way when i was at close range situation!
"Sorry I think it changes the map�s grass, naturally occurring plants and surroundings as well as any computer or tablet.

Not at all and i afk when i match someone whos higher level. not everyones like you and changed my mind. Thank you, When it comes to magic items, House Cannith offers a brokering and crafting service at its enclaves. If they really wanted ppl to drive that slow, why not punch Christians too?"
Nice thanks and also i noticed you were also using grizzled gunsmith custom 5.45x39 and if you want or need help lmk and i'll add you
man the electric spark on the ak irons look so distracting
"It�s not bad, ak ironsight is strong."
My retinas
"I love that these glitches are all the sudden appearing now that there trying to kill the game. 

I had this issue once before as well."
Welcome to vice city
Looks like a fun time....
Where it�s always day
So somehow i got the spiked gun glitch but only when i held the RPG-7 but nothing else
This is what being blind feels like
Welcome to White City
When your have too high graphics.
Rip my eyes
\*vice city music plays\*
First time in night city?
*bright
What kind of times square bullshit is this
I haven't see the bridge map like idk last year or some jesus
That's because they removed it from normal size rotation I believe and has it in the big team fights now like 10v10
That and the one with the palace. I haven't seen either in forever.
"Personally I like playing objective modes in Harbor. Especially the Hardpoints are *mostly* in good spots that are not too open nor too easy to defend.

Bridge is fun when you do a custom game with friends only and ban camping.

I do dislike Cave and Aniyah though."
Grazna Raid is great. The cave isn�t horrible either.
"I play search/cyber and I find most maps work really well for these game modes - I can actually enjoy Piccadilly, superstore, cave, even tank factory. No idea how Euphrates bridge would work but I am curious!"
"I really like that search makes most maps automatically decent. It�s how I�ve continually enjoyed MP in this game. BUT, holy crap, Sudal Harbor is abhorrent. And I get it all the time. I�d guess once every four games minimum."
Honestly love Euphrates if it's not domination. Just whip out a sniper and have some fun.
"Wait, people don't like Azhir cave? It's one of my favorites."
Id like if if there was another route in the cave and some holes ..... you get a vtol or chopper gunner just that you get 2 kills and then the enemies chill in the cave
"i bought modern warfare last month and had one of my best game in Azhir cave.

i play the game very often"
"It�s easily one of my least favorite maps, I�d rather play on Piccadilly"
I love it. The cave is such an awesome area when you know it well.
Euphrates bridge is by far the worst map PERIOD
Now I can actually play the game I'm keen to give it another crack with my Kar98 + Holo sight :P
"nah, you just dont know how to play on that map"
Grazna Raid is a good map.
"The spawns are frustrating. Like when playing domination. I can be defending B, die, get spawned on C side right at the back of the field with those empty carriages miles away from activity"
"Half of the map is dedicated to safe spawn since the stupid thing is so unecesaary big. Cut it in half anf it�ll be a good map. Otherwise, campy piece of crap."
"I like it on 10v10 tdm and HQ, and 6v6 hardpoint 

Never liked it on domination though. Same with Arklov Peak. Big maps don't suit 3 flag domination (especially peak)"
"Grazna Raid is a good map for HQ, and for 10v10 TDM. It would also be a great map for Infected if they would add it to the rotation for that. 

But it's an objectively terrible map for Domination because the spawns are so dramatically unbalanced in favour of whichever team is spawning on the A-side."
"I love Euphrates, I wish I could see it more often. :'("
"I miss the days when the 10v10 playlist only had like 6 maps so you saw them all very often haha. Now I don't see Euphrates bridge nearly as much 

If there was a 24/7 playlist for Euphrates, Grazna, Arklov, palace and Superstore I'd just play that lol"
"I'll take your map rotation if you don't want it, I'm quite fond of almost all of those maps. :P"
"bro every second lobby i get put in is fucking BROADCAST, why is that even an MP map ffs?"
It's literally one of the best maps in the game tho imo. Easily a top 3 hardpoint map and very good on other modes too
"I hate khandor because the middle building is a borderline broken spot, if a team has it they can see all 3 domination flags. 

Azhir is really fun for me as there are so many flank routes and i always get 30+ kills on it if i run around the flank lanes."
"Idk man azhir cave is pretty good, but not for chopper gunner or ac130. 

Grazna is good on 10v10 or objective game modes. 

Euphrates is a toss up, I like it in 10v10, but hate it on Domination.

Piccadilly isn't as horrible as at launch, but yes still not a good map. But that I think mainly cuz it's real life like that.

Sisal harbor is a toss up too. It's a remake map. But from a game (cod1) with super slow gameplay compared to MW"
"yeah i feel the exact same, i just don't like euphrates bacause of the sheer ammount of camping and at times even piccadilly. The rest of the maps are ok to me (i mostly play normal domain) and i actually like azhir (not for certain scorestreak tho, lol)."
They�re all awful except shoothouse and hackney yard (sometimes) lol. Maps on this game suck
"Azhir cave is awesome. As everyone seems to suck so bad on it :P

I never really played prior CoDs so I guess I don't have map ""bad habits"" weighing me down.

But wait... EUPHRATES IS BACK?!?"
"it always was, but on 10v10 :')"
I haven't seen Grazna or Bridge in months.
"cause they moved them to 10v10, they are too big for normal playlists and fortunately they noticed that"
"Grazna is in 6v6 hardpoint, headquarters and search/cyber.  Other modes it's 10v10 only"
"like what mode are you playing on, i barely get cave at all on hardpoint. piccadilly, palace, bridge and rammaza are a no show on hardpoint if at all. i hate harbor and factory, the last two of three new maps before activision bailed out, with a passion. raid is a toss up, i like to do some sniping or i can push for objective. only thing that sucks is your teammates 75% of the time and your opponents dominating from the start."
"Those 4 maps you mention as being a no show literally aren't in hardpoint rotation so that's why haha. Rammazza was removed early on, picadilly and Aniyah Incursion were removed in season 5, and Euphrates and palace are 10v10 only

I miss picadilly. It's always a joy to see because I see it so rarely. Main reason I play domination is so I can play it lol"
"What gamemode(s) are you playing?

I mostly stick to Free-For-All these days as it's the most efficient for grinding Obsid, and a typical rotation for me is more like Hackney, Hovec, Shoot House, Khandor, Gun Runner, Hovec, Hovec, Rust, Hovec, Gun Runner, Hovec, Hovec, Hovec, Hovec, Khandor, Hovec, Hackney, Hovec, Hovec, Hovec, then Hovec. 

Although to be fair I think they fixed the issue that was causing Hovec to come up so frequently � for the past little while it's been a really good mix of different maps with Hovec coming up no more than any other. 

Main point being all the maps in the FFA rotation seem to be an appropriate size, and with everyone on the map being an enemy I find enemy encounters are more frequent than in pretty much all of the team-based modes (except maybe Ground War and Shippy24/7).

Every now and then Picc comes up and I have to back out before the match starts, but I find I have fewer back-outs in FFA than in any other mode."
I actually like ever map in MW they are just good made in the one before and in CW they feel somtimes so...symmetrical...same map with a place to be between but in MW it's just like a part of a real Szenario. How about yall?
"Not really sure why Grazna Raid is hated so much. How is it any different from invasion in MW2? 

How is Tank factory any different from Derail?"
Ive just learned to enjoy those maps so I dont hate them. Still hate Piccadilly with a passion
"How dare you talk shit about grazna, best map in the game"
Wait you get bridge?? I haven't since the beta. That's my favorite map.
It's only in 10v10 now I'm pretty sure
"Also someone else mentioned this, that map could be pretty interesting for Search & Cyber with its layout I'd think. Snipers popping out of trenches and people pushing through under and over the bridge. Idk if we'll ever know though"
"99% of the maps are trash, there�s only three decent maps for the tdm games"
Tdm is trash. Not the maps
[deleted]
"Yeah, it's been like a week or so"
I would rather play Piccadilly and Cave over Shipment and Rust
"Its latency issues, server side. Are you usually running on American servers?"
yeah
Have you tried rebooting it?
"yes, im reinstalling it rn"
"Hello I just bought the game and my guns are stuck leveling up. I played 8 hours with the uzi and it stayed level 4, I can�t level up my guns or my rank at all. If you know what I can do to fix this please let me know!"
"It's one of the bugs introduced in the current patch, as is evident by the constant posts on this sub. All you can do is wait for a patch to fix it.

I recommend playing vs bots to get accustomed to maps and to try out the different weapons to see which ones you'd like to level first (you get access to all weapons when playing vs bots) in the meanwhile"
Does it still lag?
YES
"Ur pc is too weak, the buggy update reduced fps for everyone, since ur pc is weak, ur just noticing it more

And i dont know why are u still stuck on 8 GB ram, 16 gig is a minimum imo in 2021 to play games, 8 GB is a minimum if you just want to use the pc for basic stuff"
"You barely have enough RAM to run a game from 2015.

That said, you do meet the minimum memory requirements. Bear in mind performance isn't guaranteed."
"True, but the game ran perfectly before, so I'm just wondering how this update messed stuff up"
found it
No
Unfortunately it is part of the recent bugs.  You need the bundle to get the missions.
"Don't think you'll get any help from Activision but I still wish you good luck, dude."
Sad to think that a company would treat paying customers like this :/
"Rank reset for everyone when CW season 1 started around mid-December and ranks and prestiges were unified between MW, WZ, and CW. Losing all your purchases should not have happened though."
"I didn�t know that, thank you. But unfortunately I lost all weapon progress, and in game purchases :("
It happened to me a few weeks ago cuz they joined cold war to warzone
"Details:

Blueprint: XRK M4

Barrel: FSS 14.5"" Tac Lite (Zip Tie Blueprint)

Ammunition: .458 SOCOM 10-Round Mags

Stock: M-16 Stock (XRK M4 Blueprint)"
I think so too but do you think devs listen? Almost all devs of all games dont.
I have played plenty of games where the devs listen to the fanbase.
They'll only listen when they stop making money.
Sad truth...
I'm sure they'll be crushed that /u/Woozyi won't be playing for a few days! Will you at least keep us up to date with how you're doing? We love you.
Sure thing
Activision did reply to the community on twitter. Someone else posted it 3 hours ago on here. Basically just says that they are looking into it and try to be patient as they try to resolve it.
So they told us to fuck ourselves
�We�re looking into this. For starters please pay for Cold War and enjoy it for now. We are trying to break this game so people buy Cold War. We are updating the servers to be even worse so stand by for that to. Thanks for your patience! �
OK thank you for the update
"I'm not sure how cheats could modify something calculated on server side, such as player movement speed."
Maybe they�ll add it back when the fix the xp shit they fd up can only hope
I absolutely don't understand the love for these kinds of map. It's just respawn shoot respawn there's 0 thought 0 strategy. Cod doesn't require much thought but these maps take away the small part of tactic this game has.
i think we should have shoot the rusty ship 24/7 but im ok with shoot the  ship as well
Yes.
Agree.
">to ignore the majority of their player base.

fucking lol, a vocal minority of whiney players who find standard gameplay too difficult arent the majority. you play tdm and dom, they're complete shit modes, play HQ or hardpoint and you'd actually enjoy the game"
HQ sucks donkey balls
everything you said was completely wrong besides hard point being viable lol what HQ sucks it�s a camp fest and dom and tdm are one of the few casual modes left after they removed shoot the ship
I fully agree the best two maps. Can't stand any other map. But Hey if it was permanent Cold War would sell even less than it already did
"OMFG, the post below yours asked the same thing. Try reading the sub ffs."
"I mean I glanced over it and didn�t see that lmao, chill tf out"
It�s been posted like 300 times. There�s a bug
"Ok thanks.  Sorry this being a spam post, I don�t come to this subreddit often and I didn�t know it had already been posted about"
"A dev actually commented on a post like this and all it said was ""we're looking into it"" so hopefully it gets fixed next update"
Can you link the post pls?
"It's nice to see that they'll patch a bug out of warzone within hours of it surfacing, but something like this is so low on their priority list."
Please let me know when this is fixed. I just bought the game and wanted to level up the mp5 but it wasn�t working. My discord is Rubix#5980 lmk when this is fixed!! Tyyyyy
You will level up but it's very rare that you'll get xp tho
Clear cache
"I've found the uzi to be easy even without shoot the ship, same with the Mr but then again it is a meta gun"
can u still go for obsidian if u don�t have platinum?
you just need gold
.41AE Uzi is pretty delicious
"Forget about Shipment, do yourself a favor and wait for the next update."
I wish ones when shipmeant was coming back depresses me it�s gone
You might not wanna come back yet played 10 games last night and got 0xp for my Finn
it tracked progress for my obsidian just fine. the problem is in the XP
"No, since last Friday or so. Was fine before that."
This is only a recent bug since the last update.
It has been an on again off again issue for a while in Warzone. Sometimes it just stops giving xp or reduces it then suddenly the xp comes back.
Fuckn aye broo. Its always fun in rebirth trios or armored quads when your whole team ditches you
"Maybe you get to leave once or twice without any real penalty (covers for people who crash or get disconnected too), but 3rd game left in under an hour? That's a 15 minute time-out my man!"
"I kinda like this idea. Imo, I think 5-10 minutes would be more appropriate. This gives the dead a choice: leave and be penalized or give the living a chance to rez. 
I feel that 5-10 minutes is fair to both parties without driving the dead people to boredom. I used to hate waiting on pubg for friends to finish a 40 minute game while I was dead 10 minutes in."
"Yeah, on reflection 5-10 minutes is fairer. I had just come off the back of many games of it happening so the pain was still raw!"
"100% agree with you, but don't put it on IW. This is Activision's fault and IW doesn't have any control over it."
I�m pretty sure IW didn�t want to kill modern warfare. Activision made them kill it.
"No, Raven just fucked it with WZ patches."
I agree with you 100000% but these subs are full of kids and mods that use alt accounts and they will downvote your post and tell you stop complaining they do that shit to me on the cold war sub all of the time
"Holy shit people are so dense,you say yourself that intentionally breaking it make sense yet you still think that it was intentional"
They killed it when the SPR and ASVAL came out
*grunts* Capitalism
Oh boy what did they do this time? I haven�t been following the cod news latet
"The latest update to mw broke the game. Weapon xp doesn�t track, camos changing in game, and no hitmarkers."
"You know it isn't even that they broke the game. It's the lack of comunication, which is nearly non existend. They treat us like trash, people need to wake up."
"I'm sure there are some devs there that actually enjoy gaming. I mean, it does a lot RIGHT otherwise we wouldn't be here on Reddit talking about it at all."
They actually responded. Shocking
I know right? My initial reaction as well. Followed by: They're probably trolling us
"Well, there's now indication that they are actually aware.  So let's just see how long it takes to fix."
You would think 5 days is enough...
thank god. i thought they were done supporting this game and left it to rot. this is reassuring. hopefully the patch gets released by thursday night or earlier
"In other words: 

""Keep buying bundles while we fix the game in a few weeks"""
Bruh this needs to be top 10 plays  LMAOOOO
"You are using a sniper, camping is forgivable only for snipers"
AHAHA! Fuckin sick
"Just a tweet I found on Twitter, hopefully it�ll be fixed soon."
"Have you considered perhaps scrolling down on the page before mindlessly posting the same thing hundreds of other people have posted? Yes, XP is bugged right now. Yes, every single person on reddit knows. Please scroll down a bit next time."
Have you ever considered not being an ass? I just joined this feed and scrolled down and several post we're videos and no one discussing it. Just a simple question. Thanks for help dick.
Might not be your issues but if by chance your not the one who bought the game (someone else�s account in your house) that owner needs to be the one logged in to install it. My brother and I had this issue with coop recently.
"I bought the game, disc version to be exact. How did he fix it?"
Same here. I bought the game 3 days ago
"i gave my friend my account with modern warfare on it and he can't even install all the packs only the mains one, the game not letting him install all the packs and the ps store doesn't have the files WTF i just paid 44.99 for the game!"
Same thing. I'm missing the spec ops pack 2 and i can't find it anywhere. Really wanna play the spec ops.
"I see no problem with one Deagle, but TWO Deagles bring more power to the table"
Feels so smooth hitting a sliding double-one tap with deags.
"Dual Desert Eagles is so much fun, though I'm not sure I've been *this* successful with them haha.

I reaaaaally wish using Akimbo let you use the Fire Mode button to switch to only one pistol."
"I have akimbo on every pistol, and the Akimbo Deagles are satisfying but bullet rng fucks you over so much."
Ah a man of culture I see
Burst-fire rennetti? snake-shot magnums? Just gimme those double deags.
Nice bloodthirsty
Ty brother!
I say this always.... the deagle is seriously slept on in core.
"Dual deagles are absolute garbage though. Their spread is off the charts.

What's slept on in core and warzone is dual M19. 

Great accuracy for an akimbo pistol, kills in one tap in core and melts in warzone if you have the trigger finger."
I�m on Xbox btw
"I had the same issue, got the DEV error. What I ended up doing was playing either spec ops or the campaign first then load into multiplayer. Hopefully that helps you."
"Same thing here, but mine has been crashing since Cold War came out. They found a way to make an issue even worse by trying to resolve it. What is going on over there!?"
I got the same split screen crash issue on my PS4. This is ridiculous.
Same! Did you find a way to fix this?
No probably won�t be fixed until the next set of patches at least
"Same issue here. Game works fine if playing solo but as soon as my son and I try to load into a multiplayer split screen game, it crashes. Hopefully the release of the new season will fix this. Worked fine before the latest update earlier this month."
"Same issue here, I wish they would solve it asap, because restarting the Xbox every time is really getting annoying..."
Yeah same issue
Same here !!!!! Its really frustrating
Re-downloading the game helped a friend with this error
What�s your setup?
"Tac laser, Variable Zoom, 208 Blitz stock, feather assembly, 338 lapua rounds"
Yep the SPR and the Val are both in need of a nerf but IW hasn�t done it yet
Neither of them need nerfs
apparently he did lmao
"Yep, you did"
Get nae nae�d
"I can agree with that statement. From what I understand it is still a $60 game new and there are probably mutliple new players joining everyday. Some of them probably don't follow these kinds of groups either. Imagine paying full price for a game, waiting a day for it to install, and when you finally get to play it you are stuck using default weapons and can't level up. I agree the media should be at minimum putting a warning out there to future potential buyers. This game is worse than when I first bought it. There is no logic behind that."
"That�s me. Bought it on Feb 5th and installed by Feb 6th... Now stuck at 1st rank with out any ability for upward movement. All I can do is play with the 3 default weapon choices and it sucks, especially cause I bought it digital so I can�t return it and I have had no response from reaching out to the company."
"How do you propose to reach the media? No one cares about a game that is more than 1 year old now. (Outside of the player base, I mean)

Places such as IGN are more of a mockery of what game media should be. Maybe they were decent a decade or two ago, but the stuff they do now seems to be more of advertisements and amateur hour.

The same thing is happening with content creators on YouTube and Twitch. The large channels are being paid to promote a game, because the community will mistake it as a decent review, and after a short period these content creators have left the game, and are speaking horrible things about it. It's shocking to me how much this still works.

The same goes for e-sports. These companies spend millions to get large media coverage from people who aren't likely gamers, and their audiences probably aren't really gamers, so there's rarely any talks of the really negative things that all competitive games deal with. There's no coverage of the cheating, smurfing, exploiting, glitching, or the ""Oh, we'll try to patch that, eventually"" mentality.

This might be something that is unstoppable. Even if that is the case, that doesn't mean you have to take part. For instance, if your favorite content creator is doing these things, you are free to stop watching/subscribing. If you don't like the way Activision/Blizzard has handled this game, don't buy any of their upcoming products, and don't watch content on it. You are free to view/subscribe to someone else who isn't a part of these things. You are free to play other games. (Though they might not be as fun to you) Who knows, your view/purchase might be the start of the change you want to see. If not, at least you can know you didn't contribute."
true words
I never wished for 4chan to show up so bad but god knows they don't give a fuck
You want media coverage for bugs in a video game? Why not just play something else til it�s fixed lmao
As much as u hate to say it bugs on COD isn't newsworthy... maybe to IGN or something? But yeah these big gaming companies are getting worse with fixing things like this... no one cares about making a good game unless they are going to get RIDICULOUS amounts of money
Bugs are to be expected. What isn't expected is going 4 days without making any official statement about a core function (weapon progression) of a full priced game being absent.
Clearly you have no understanding of the situation. �Just bugs�...? sure buddy...
"It was media worthy when it happened in March last year. At that time IW had ongoing communication of progress on the issue and fixed it in just over 24 hours.

We are going on 4 days this time with no communication on it."
"You realise, in their eyes we are not worthy for anything else then offering them money?

Get over it.

Im happy that I stopped after 300 hours, never seen a company handeling their customers like this.

Anyone how supports cod at this point is a mindless drone."
"My weapons also don�t progress, or erratically.
I can have a full match with 15-20 kills and not get any weapon xp!"
Yeah. But did you gain exp in your first matches today like me? Because I did. Now I had like 3 games in a row with 3.0 KDA and didn't gain shit.
This is just wrong and dumb
Thanks for your opinion! You mean my hypothesis? Or you mean if that is actually true?
"Unlikely, for me it's completely erratic when and after what match I get any Xp."
Looks pretty good for a first person game
Like can this be a game mode lil mw2 ?!?!
It looks good makes me wish this was a staple in the cod games.
No it shouldn't. Shut up.
The camera even offsets properly when you aim. That means there will be a TPS mode in the future
It just means they developed it. Hardly proof that it will definitely be a thing. I don't trust them enough to implement this. I hope I'm wrong because 3rd person is great
This glitch has been a thing since launch. It's probably cut content
"Every Call of Duty has this, it�s just never implemented."
I'm pretty sure it's just there to get shadows and other things looking right. Which is why the movement lags so much.
I would honestly like to see a third person mode
"I liked 3rd person in MW2, was pretty decent at it too."
I did this once it's pretty wack
How is it done? I want too know
Reminds me of 3rd person team tactical from mw2
Why can�t this be a thing...
"It will, just wait for the next season something big is gonna happen my guy ;)"
Why isn't sykov already in the game damnit? I just want to play with that shit
"Honestly I like this way in 1st person because if we happened to have 3rd Person People would get destroyed by the Amount of People from Cover 
I dont think I need to explain"
I kinda wish this was an option in survival.
Weird thing is that a while ago I entered a match of search and destroy and the spectator can was in 3rd person. Like I could toggle between 1st and 3rd. Looked like zombies lol
I�ve had this. Whenever someone is reviving you at the point the round finishes and you would be self revived you go into third person.
Do guns still level up in survival mode
"yes, just pretty slowly.  
I maxed the Sykov and CX-9 in survival and the guns aren't available in MP modes yet."
take notes cyberpunk 2077
No weapon XP but very little match XP. Just finished a full game hardpoint win with 30 kills and 1st position to only get 3000-ish XP
"Known bug currently, no response from Activision as I know of"
"We�ve finally got some response... something I found on Twitter

>	Hey there Teo sorry for any inconveniences. Please note that studio is currently looking into this issue at the moment. Please hang tight for now and stay tuned in-game or to our official channels for updates. ^DW

https://twitter.com/atviassist/status/1358866959681650688?s=21"
"Wow I thought it was just modern warfare, cuz there�s been xp bugs since launch. But Cold War too, I hadn�t heard. Damn they really fucked it"
Lmao they fucked up CW too? These shitheads at Activision really don�t know how to actually play dirty.
Has anyone else had this problem? My friend on ps4 had the same problem but fixed it with a quick restart of his console... Is there any other option than deleting and reinstall the game?
"If they are only op when an experienced player uses them, then they aren�t op. Op weapons are ones anyone can use effectively, which is why they are overpowered."
I guess quickscoping doesn't count?  I can't quickscope for the life of me.
"I dunno, for the most part, even bad shield players tend to be kinda difficult to take out (most shield players I've run into are bad), all they have to do is crouch and have high enough sensitivity to turn and block your shots. The only way I'm able to kill a shield player (without explosives, cuz I just run frags and never really use 'em) is to juke 'em out or pretend like you're running away and turn around right after you do while they take out their kali sticks. Their not super hard to dispose of if you can trick them, but most shield players are just bad players, so having a pretty big chance of losing to some idiot who was able to block a doorway for just a couple of seconds while his teammate came to bail him out seems like a problem. I don't know about OP, but it's not really a test of who has more skill, it's just about who has better equipment."
"i dont agree at all, the as val is a great example. the gun has significant recoil and slow bullet velocity but in the hands of a good player, its ridiculously OP"
"It�s been 3 or 4 days since the problem with the XP started and it�s still not fixed 
I honestly begun to hate this game because of it"
What�s so amazing about this video he just beat someone 1v1
Gaming God
I dont get it
the dude we were spectating clutched that 1v1 and just barely defused the bomb lol
Try reading the sub. Millions of threads saying the same thing.
"Since the latest patch you only get xp and leveling up your guns by playing warzone. And no, there wasn't any communiation so far."
"Does blood money or whatever the WZ respawn money mode is called work? Cuz I can't level anything at all, and I'd like to be able to level my weapons again."
Do you get post-match XP?
Same here
"Yeah, I have the same problem. The only way I get XP is when I complete challenges."
We�ve had this and it does our heads in! Sometimes we have to restart. Or turn the Xbox off. Disconnect it from the power for a few minutes. And then then it back on and it�s usually fine.
Will try this� thank you!
I�ve been having this issuue as well on the series x idk what they did
loses play of the game to a rpg kill lmao
Every time I swear!
Why is this marked as nsfw
Cuz activision is fucking us
Would�ve taken a free double xp charm before you fucked us Activision
"The AK 47's gotta be my favorite AR in the game, but it's so slept on! Great clip, btw!"
That ak 47 lol
Good shit. I like that AK
How the fuck is every single kill a one shot one kill
Probably playing on Hardcore.
How old are you? I constantly hear the word �toxic� on this. I�m guessing it�s a gen z word.
22
How old are you?
Have you never heard of the word Toxic?
Ak in hardcore is CRINGE
The slide canceling
That shit was just up before I played a match of plunder and when it was over the armored truck thing was gone. They did have a clock saying for a short time and said 2x xp  until  2/8.  I thought it would be the whole day not mid match oops  no more 2xp
? Im confused as to what your saying.
The truck game
The squad thing? Thats what it was for
It was there when I started a match and after the match it was gone
Oh.
"A squad in the cod app is like a guild,with �weekly tournaments�,that would award xp tokens (and a calling card for both CW and MW if your squad reached #1)

A regiment (MW only) is an in-game guild,that has a �happy hour�,which is double xp set up by the owner,for a certain hour,the owner can also set up a special yellow clan tag,you can always use it if you want"
So is there a way to get out of the �squad� one and either join a different one or make a different one if so do you know how?
Same reason as any other game. Who the hell knows why.
It seems like it was randomized who got hit marks bugged and who did not
"Warzone or Multiplayer?

i didn't played warzone.. but MP weapon XP is broken for everyone"
"What platform are you on?  


Not getting any issues on PC I heard its just console?"
no weapon xp in mp for pc either
What platform?
"Must be an account thing, CoD has a lotta patches where only certain people get their meticulously curated bugs, this must be one of them. I know when I spectate certain people, they still have hit markers."
bruh what was that flick in the start damn
His aimbot these dudes have no chill look at the last one curve the pistol at the end aswell dudes out here flexing with the cheats
tried to get the second guy but he hid :D
"Yeah you sure the aimbot wasn�t doing the work fam? 

What is it with these guys and trying to get Internet points by posting their clips as if people won�t notice?

Oh and inb4 �hurr durr it�s keyboard and mouse with 1000 sensitivity�"
Facts
"Hilarious that you actually think you have any idea what an aimbot is, go educate yourself buddy"
"This is the first clip on this sub that I have questioned. Gonna say hacks, but with evidence disproving my accusation I will change my mind."
if you use the 8.3 barrel (i think) it kind of reminds me of the msmc from BO2 but more OP

I think I�m getting weapon XP when I unlock camos. But nothing else.
I am getting camos as well.
Yeah. I am getting 500-800xp for almost 20-30 kills. Its not taking every kill xp and giving only camos progression xp!!
"I've noticed attachments unlock, but any camo classes that are level locked, like say the skulls for example, haven't been opening up for me.  

For me: I've been using the HDR for the final gun for my Damascus grind.  I started it at level 21 on Friday.  Now, it has not technically leveled up at all, but attachments have been unlocking, camos within camo classes that I had already unlocked are being awarded, but the gun isn't progressing beyond level 21 and the XP bar isn't moving.... And the next camo class that would normally open up at level ""whatever"" isn't opening up."
"Cannot earn XP at all.

No Weapon XP
No Match XP.

I can unlock Camos which typically gives me 250 xp in total."
"I'm not noticing any of the bugs people are complaining about either. I'm in the UK & on PC.

Edit// Played a few games this evening and I'm getting weapon XP but hardly any. Unlocked and so far have 204 kills with the Fennec & it's only level 8. Match XP is fine, hit markers, reticles all good."
I believe most of the impact due to weapon XP bug is for console users. I am on Xbox One X and I do not get weapon XP in MW multiplayer along with other bugs introduced in the 1.31 patch
You have Hit markers then?
Mods removed your post because everyone's been posting about it for days now. They're just trying to curb the spam.
Maybe there should be a pinned post at the top of the sub -- I keep coming back to check for updates and it would be nice to have a centralized place.
"There's not enough spam for such a fcking issue. Like, what the heck, 50% of Call of duty is about leveling up weapons, discovering new ones, and trying to find the best combination.  


It is not like they just released a patch and I am complaining within the first 2 hours, this has been happening for days now, like, what the hell, it should be as easy as rolling back the last update, right?"
"My MP games keeps crashing like crazy, one game, crash, one or two games, crash, this happens when playing alone or on Split screen (xbox1)"
"My question is why is the MOST basic feature/need of the game still broken after last Thursdays update?  They fixed the No operator change and camo's changing randomly bugs but still no fix for hit markers and no XP????  Cripes. 

everyone post to Raven's and COD and Activision's twitter and insta like everyday to raise the noise level!"
New Kid: Cold Wars hasn�t reached Profits yet that�s why making previous main game to be disappointed game
"No mate, the question is, how they can miss such an obvius problem. Do they even test the new version of the game or they simply just release it?"
My weapons get xp sometimes.  Some weapons never get xp though and some seem to get them ever other match or so.
yeah I get way less. Like I'll get a game or 2 of xp from playing 40 matches.
"Maybe that weapon is gaining xp cause of camos and challanges? Maybe that's why, but i'm not 100% positive on that"
"Still no XP in MP, no reticle and the weird menu bug. PS4 pro with the texture pack. 

They desperately need to just roll back this last update"

"By ""Help"" you mean that it gets fixed, so I will receive XP by playing multiplayer?"

"I picked the worst fucking time for platinum ARs, huh?"
I decide to wait on the shotgun camo�s and finish the LMG�s and now with no shoot the ship and no weapon xp... fml
"The fact that Activision / Raven Software / Infinity Ward all checked out for the weekend and didn't quickly spring to action to fix this is beyond pathetic. 

A good company would try to patch this within 48-72 hours.

There's a good chance it's gonna be a 5-7 day thing and next update will ""fix"" everything.

Speaking of which, they removed Armored Royale in Warzone cus you could become invisible but they haven't fixed other aspects of the game. 

Just fucking LOL."
"Yes, even small development studios can do better. If there is such a bug, for example in Smite, it is fixed within a day and there is triple XP the following weekend. I don't want to say that Hirez Studios doesn't screw up more often, but they prioritize the important things when fixing bugs. Also, you get info from the devs like ""We know you can't level in the game right now, but we're working on a hotfix that will be applied as soon as possible."""
Lol remember the revive bug in (hardcore) cyber attack? Took them literally over a month with almost no acknowledgement of it. At least they fixed it eventually but goddamn
"As someone coming from Escape From Tarkov, really, community there used to be mad about devs when a new bug would happen, but, holy shit, as soon as it was discovered at least they would tweet saying they are working on it even if it was on weekend, on night, etc.... and there would be follow-up tweets in case they would be taking longer.  


But here? nah, why would they even care right?"
I tried using a level 1 gun with a double xp token and still can't get any xp. Hope this gets fixed soon
Love it. Was wondering why I haven't been getting any XP on the weapon I've been trying to level up. I just popped a 2X Weapon XP token too for an hour
"Meanwhile, warzone plunder is fine so you can still grind XP through that via supply run contracts."
"I wished I had gotten her Season 1 skin, I hate the Season 3 one."
"I got into CoDMW 2 weeks ago, what do you mean by season 1 skin? I thought u could unlock them via operator missions? :o"

She's been through hell... And then some
Why would you install it again if it broke your console the first time?
Many people don't learn after tripping over a rock the first time.
You need to clean your ps4 onci in a 2-3 month. Or it will die from overheat.
At this point it�s ur ps4
SO MY PS4 IS OK WHEN PLAYING OTHER GAMES FOR HOURS BUT WHEN I PLAY MODERN WARFARE FOR 5 MINUTES IT KILLS ITSELF?
"its kind off becoming my mantra, but have you tried clearing ps4 cache (remove power cable from the console back -not wall- for at least 30s)

\*has solved some weird issue's with this game"
"It depends on how long you�ve had your PS4, how often you clean it out and if where you have your PS4 is well ventilated"
No my guy I�ve been assured that no game other than Cyberpunk can do this. Not even Anthem back when it launched and was frying consoles left and right. Nope. That didn�t happen at all.
Never heard or seen this game brick any console..its your console clean it properly and take care of it.
"It bricked my ps4 slim, and I clean mine"
"Dont worry, I have a very similar issue. I was trying to unlink my Activision account from my Blizzard account but I get no confirmation from Activision so it won't let me unlink them."
wait so did you get into your account?
I disagree with 90% of these points.
Lol. I agree with 90% of them. Shows how different the playerbase can be and how impossible it is to make everyone happy. The best they can do is *whelm* all of us
And that's right! Me too by the way never saw such a bad list. This guy should go and play some Cold War cuz he's searching for old trash.
"remove. dragons. breath. 
need i say more?"
Agreed with alot of this. Id like to see full auto side arms return like the mp9 or g18.
"I agree with most of these but I would keep doors and mounting. Definitely need maps with rain, storms etc."
"For the minimap why not keep it the same with the compass also ?



And what�s the big deal witb dead silence as a perk with it as a field upgrade It seems better"
"Dead silence was always kinda the go to perk when it came to aggressive play, and then making it a field upgrade further discourages that.

With the minimap it kinda feels like they were just trying to fix something that wasn�t broken and I think it is just kinda silly and weird what they did with it. The game wasn�t even going to originally have a minimap which was a weird and poor choice and I hope that with the next game it will have the regular cod minimap from the start because there was no reason to change it."
"The doors were actually one of my favourite additions. I mainly play objective modes and the doors were amazing for reducing grenade spam and made it much more interesting to defend objectives. 

We definitely need smaller and better maps. That was like the only major issue I had with MW. I loved pretty much everything else but the maps just weren�t very good and were way too big.

Mounting I can definetly live without but I hear it is actually pretty well liked in SnD so at the very least It would be nice for them to remove camo challenges involving it"
"Probably a bit too ambitious, but I'd like to see them make two different types of maps for 6v6 and 10v10 maps. Make versions that promote movement that aren't too porous, not full of doors, and limited places to hide so that the game promotes movement. I get tired of all the camping and searching for enemies. Too many Free For All games end in a timeout from the maps being too big and porous. 

 In addition make maps that do have doors, and places to hide for a Realism Mode. 

Do not make maps so huge like Aniyah Palace. 

Get rid of bunny hopping. That should not be a thing. Getting tired of my bullets not registering when an opponent is bunny hopping. It's like the jumping is too much for their netcode. Plus it looks ridiculous. Guy jumping back and forth with an AX-50 like he's on a trampoline. 

Get rid of quick scoping and stop adding guns like the SP-R which is impossible to compete with when dealing good quick scopers. 

Add water elements, such as swimming."
"You had me until the quickscoping comment. SPR was probably the best thing to happen to MW imo. It�s just so much fun. Yeah it�s kinda cheesy, but the sniping in this game is generally too slow, but having the Marksman�s rifles, especially the SPR and kar-98, make up for that"
"Disagree. But doors should be destructible

Disagree. We need small, medium and big maps. Variety is the key. MW2019 maps aren't complicated either.

Agree

Mounting without challenges, Agree

Disagree, I like the camos

Agree

100% Disagree. I don't want to be punished for shooting without a suppressor and I hate mandatory perks (Ghost/Dead Silence).

"I have the same problem. I thought of a shadow ban as well, but I haven't cheated and my kd is below 1."
What is a shadow ban?
"it can�t be shadow ban because that would mean we�re ALL shadow banned. I have this problem and i�m not doing insanely well lately to get reported. im grinding demascus so my KD has dropped to a little over 1. i seriously doubt they�d assume someone with my KD is hacking. so it�s really just their server issues. no way i�m shadow banned, and unless you�re hitting insane shots that people get salty and report you, you�re prob not shadow banned either"
"""we're all?"" I haven't read about this issue at all, except for op and I"
[deleted]
"Shadow banning someone with 0.93 KD in Multuplayer, 1.07 in BR, and 27 wins in 1,500 games is a bit moronic, if that is the case. I don�t think that is the case though. When I play BR with my friends they host in Europe, I experience the same ping as I did before, which is around 150ms. The problem is when I play in MP and I host. I have a feeling they screwed up the servers in my region!"
Don't look at the fire by the stairs after the cutscene when price and hadir kill the russian guy
"That's exactly where my game crashes, but I was able to get past that part by like 20 seconds. I ended up in the big room to our left, then there it would eventually crash."
"Same happened to me. I started the campaign, played a couple hours and then at the barkov mansion mission it crashed. Now the game wants me to start from the 'London house raid' one again.

I'll try if it let's me continue at going dark as you described it.

If not, I'm done with the campaign."
"I'm trying but the fact that no xp and I can't get a single weapon to level up is some serious b.s.

I really hope this was just an error in the last update and it'll be back to normal soon."
"I agree it�s irritating and gives me no motive or goal to work towards, especially since I want to level them up to use in Warzone. In the meantime I�ve just been unlocking camos for guns I already maxed out just to have something to do. On the bright side I�m almost at platinum camo for ARs :)"
Best we can do is to hope
Yeah man I'm with you. It's hard for me to see a point playing when my weapons won't level up. Not to mention I'm 4 away from Damascus so it's been really frustrating
"So, I'm not the only one having this problem. I thought that I was crazy to think that I wasn't earning experience for my weapon."
"I don't think that the people quitting are going to CW, looks like they're pissed by what Activision has done and are looking forward to BF6 or some other games, a lot of my friends are just dropping all COD games until they get their shit together."
"Yeah, I've seen the same. I don't think the glitches are to get people to play CW, but the shop changes are definitely there to get people to transfer to CW."
no. pepsi
"cheeseburger, coke!"
"maybe the best we can do it stop playing mw and not buying cw

&#x200B;

like theyll think ""huh they hate cw that much that theyd rather not play any cod"""
"Yep. That may do something, but you'd also have to quit WZ"
"It does suck with the no xp or weapon xp but at the same time I find. It a good break from having tthe urge. To level stuff up, so I'm using this time to use my leveled up guns because normally I'd. Level them up and then just move on yo the next. And all tho the lobbies are horrible I've found best luck in using a. Riot shield to cover your back and then a low recoil gun, I personally use the Uzi. But it still does have fun to it once you find a decent lobby"
Maybe they shoulda took action on the hackers earlier.....
I'm sticking on MW19 through and through
"I like modern warfare and cold war is okay on my book too but really in the end its just a game, every other cod is just gonna be the same. I don't know about you but I'm moving on there really is no new content as of right now."
"I dont wnt to give up, but after getting shadow banned for no reason is pretty much forcing me to, i really dont know if i will ever get back to normal."
"I literally had my Damascus account taken just after Cold War released, and still I haven�t had a reply from the 2 forms of contact I have taken on a the support page except for the generic we are looking into your request bullshit. Fed up on this game now, countless hours wasted and all those cod points ( not a lot but still) I spent on nice guns and tracer packs. So now if I want to torture myself on WARZONE, I�m already at a disadvantage with some guns I no longer own (Grau) which I had Damascus and now on my new account I don�t currently have unlocked because I have lost faith in this game. Even electronic arts (EA) who are pure scum imo have the decency to answer a live chat or answer a phone and deal with your request immediately or in a decent time frame and not even bother replying in 3 months."
"Go to Activision's website and go to support. It'll ask what game, choose Modern Warfare. Then choose Multiplayer for the next question, and then for the last just put I am experiencing a lot of lag and hit enter or whatever. Now scroll down and an option to live chat with an Administrator opens up as well as live chat with an Employee."
What I say is if they want to treat their players like this we should simply all give up on their entire franchise until they release actual good content. If we keep playing the only thing they see is that they can treat us llike garbage and we will keep playing the subaverage crap they release.
Braaa these invisible cunts are doing my head in. Between that and just getting randomly kicked from a game it's TUFF out here
"I wanna play cos Cold War absolutely sucks but not being able to level my weapons annoys me in such a weird way I can�t even explain it, it�s like getting served an amazing looking plate of food then it tasting of ash, it�s all there but like wtf? I hope this isn�t intentional and I won�t give up but siiiigh, death to capitalism and all that"
"Only reason why I bought CW was for the campaign and zombies. Multiplayer is full of sh*t because of Sbmm, and if I want to play multiplayer I�ll go to MW."
Lmao.
"The whole leveling system appears to be broken. Just count yourself lucky you haven�t had your level rolled back. I finished a 2 hour zombies game yesterday and gained 10 levels, only to lose 4 of them once I got back into the lobby. Literally watched my level drop from 272 on the end screen to 268 when I loaded back in. 

It appears that if you level up from the end of match XP you also lose that level once in the lobby. 

They clearly broke something in their attempt to unify leveling across all titles. 

Another thing I noticed is in Warzone I have more xp towards my next level than when in Cold War."
It�s the same for me probably just a bug
"The last update removex exp and hitmarkers (obviously a bug)
Don't listen to the other guy, he's just an idiot."
Games been bugged since Friday they don't care to fix it fast because its only for console. No hitmarkers no aim assist. Unplayable
"Man that sucks, was such a good game"
There�s a setting for hit markers and you not hitting shots isn�t the game lmao. It�s called being rusty
"Why do people do this?  
https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lepyjv/no_hit_markers/

https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/lei00o/hit_markers/   
https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/ldin6t/did_mw_just_remove_body_hit_markers/

There's clearly a bug with the hit markers right now.   Don't have to make OP feel like they're crazy."
"I�ve taken breaks before and this feels nothing like being rusty, everything feels wierd including the movement and aiming. I played a bit of warzone not too long ago as well so it shouldn�t be the case"
Have you even played the game since the latest patch?
honestly i can�t tell if you are sarcastic or if you ride the short bus
"Here's a Tier list for MP:

S-Tier: As Val, FAL, SPR, Kar, 680, 725

A-Tier: AUG, MP5, CR-56, RAM, M4, R9-0, VLK, Jak-12, Origin, AX50, HDR, MK2

B-Tier: MP7, Uzi, Kilo, Bizon, P90, Fennec, SKS

C-Tier: AK47, Scar, Grau, Bruen, Fr 5.56, Oden, SA87, EBR, Dragunov, FiNN, Rytex, Striker, Holger, PKM

D-Tier: M13, M34, AN94, ISO, Crossbow

Literal Trash: M91

The way i ranked them: 
S Tier = Overpowered and needs a nerf
A Tier = The best weapons in the game that aren't OP. Usually balanced against eachother
B Tier = They are good, but they are missing something to push them over the edge
C Tier = These guns can still hold their own, but have significant flaws that limit the viable playstyles. Generally not highly competitive.
D Tier = Significant flaws define the gun more so than their respective strengths. They are basically the worst
Literal Trash: The tier for the single worst gun in the game. It has nothing. mediocre fire rate, bad damage, extremely slow, there is absolutely nothing that makes this gun good at anything. why does it even exist

Some places are slightly debatable. For example the AN-94 has insane killing potential if you hit all chest and the hyperburst, but i'd still say the inconsistency and overreliance on it makes it bad.

I read some of your comments and you said you prefer ARs and SMGs? Let me tell you some quick words about the top choices for the top picks:

As Val / FAL: please don't, they are a nuisance

CR-56: This gun is probably the overall best (non-OP) AR in the game with good damage, decent fire rate and good everything from handling to recoil. You can kit it differently to further pronounce CQB or long range, but no matter what you choose, it is a solid pick

Ram-7: The Ram is essentially a faster firing M4. It otherwise handles very similar. It has fast handling in ADS, ADS movement, etc and imo very nice irons. The only downside you might find is a dislike for recoil patterns going to the left, which i personally don't mind. But even if you do, give the gun a rry, the first ~10 bullets go almost straight up.

M4: Here comes the M4, the jack of all trades but master of none. It's best at absolutely nothing except one thing and that's not being bad at anything. It just gives you a versatile and consistent experience with solid performance

AUG: Personally my top pick for best SMG, as long as you use 5.56. You combine the upsides of AR and SMG by getting damage and range that are more in line with ARs, but keeping SMG handling, especially in terms of sprintout time or weapon swap times, which are important for aggressive playstyles. Up close you need 3 shoots anywhere in the body and your 4 shot range goes out to about 60m when hitting chest shots. Although the killing potential is slightly slower than the MP5, it's more consistent by not punishing hits to limbs and offering much better range. The only real downside is that you'd have to get used to the gun, as it feels and plays quite a bit different than most others.

MP5: The MP5 is a gun that has one of the best killing potentials up close with a very fast ttk in the 3 shot range, however it also requires a lot of accuracy to consistently hit torso without mixing in limb shots. However even with limb shots it's a good gun overall. It has good handling, easy recoil, good damage output and a rather high, and thus forgiving, fire rate. Basically everything you need for a top tier gun"
An94 and m13 in D? What are you smoking?
"If you wanna send me a friend request, I can walk you though the mechanics and weapon specifics in a private match. Always looking for more online friends.

BramStokersAcura#6648101 (activision)"
I don't have every weapon but I like smgs and ars so those r probably the weapons I'll use
"top ARs are M4 (easiest to use), AS val (OP if you can handle it), AMAX (very good dps even at longer ranges)

top SMGs are MP5 (best at close range), MP7 (has no recoil, extremely easy to use), UZI with 41ae ammo (extreme range for an smg)"
amax uzi mo5 mp7 kilo spr208 kar98k ax50
"Oh, that's cool"
"Honestly you can shred with any gun. Just find a gun you personally like and get comfortable with a build. Trying to adhere to the meta can sometimes be exhausting.

Once you�ve grinded Damascus you realize you really can shred with every gun if you put time in to a balanced build."
"Core or hardcore?  Run & gun?

AS VAL is fun."
"don't. stop the as val abuse, that thing is disgustingly op"
"did you say you like SMGs and ARs? try out the m4a1 (my favorite AR) or the Kilo 141, some good SMGs are the mp5, mp7, and uzi, try hopping into a private match with bots and see which guns best suits your playstyle, and since you're new, remember FMJ helps your gun pierce walls it does not add damage to your gun!"
"Here is a tier list geared towards Search and Destroy. Obviously theres some room for subjectivity depending on your play style. I have Damascus so I have ran all of these quite a bit.

S: R9-0, SPR-208, M4A1, MP5, 725, AS VAL

A: SCAR 17, AX-50, Kar98k, AK-47, Uzi, MP7, PKM, Kilo 141

B: HDR, M13, Grau 5.56, Striker .45, AMAX, Finn, Fennec, AN-94


C: FR 5.56, RAM-7, AUG, Model 680, SA87, EBR14, ISO

D: Mk.2 Carbine, Oden, P90, Bizon, Origin 12, M92, Holger 26 

E: MG34, Crossbow 

F: VLK Rogue, Dragunov



Edit: Forgot a few DLC guns."
"Thanks this is what I was looking for, but where are weapons like the fennec and the iso"
"S (sweat) tier: Kilo, Mp5

F tier: everything else"
Lol. Kilo is not good anymore. Even the m13 is better now
"""You have already responded to this survey. Thank you again for your time.""

I guess they actually did read all of my reddit posts since Cold Sore came out."
"Here is the link to submit a bug report 

https://support.activision.com/modern-warfare/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-feedback-and-bug-reporting"
I just turned the game on and it's asking me to purchase it. I literally have the disc in
"There's a major bug in the game, no kind of XP is being recorded. I wasted double weapon XP tokens. Hopefully, this gets fixed soon."
"My XP is being recorded just fine. I just hit 40 about an hour ago, and my SP-R 208 is levelling up without issues. I just hit 48 with it ~~earlier tonight~~ last night (didn't realize it's already 10 AM. Lol)"
Same.
"From what I've read this is a Visual bug in the game at this point in time (No statement from Raven or Activision as of yet though) the missions you're currently trying to work through are supposed to be a part of a bundle bringing back season 1 skins for Mara, Bale etc. I believe the mara bundle will be 2400 COD points to buy as seen from COD tracker. The packs will be called Vault packs. Hope this helps!"
"> the missions you're currently trying to work through are supposed to be a part of a bundle bringing back season 1 skins

Even if that's correct for Mara (or even Domino and others), some of them are battle pass missions from past seasons, definitely *not* newly added objectives. The munitions box objectives for example. Raines' is from his season four battle pass mission (objective 4/4), Iskra's is from her season five mission (objective 3/4), and Zane's is from his season six mission (objective 1/4)

EDIT: And it's not like the munitions box missions are old ones that I didn't do, and they just aren't available anymore. I literally did Raines' and Iskra's other objectives a couple days before this post. The munitions box step just isn't progressing"
"Zane�s only worked for me while playing Warzone.
Edit: it also works in the pre-match (warm-up)"
"I actually tried them all, before giving up for the time being, and joining the wait for a fix.

I was actually quite excited and impressed, seeing how many ""new skins"" and challenges were added without me even noticing (and I didn't see it mentioned anywhere else but here now), and yet noone tracks. Not the kills, not the whatever you'd need to do.

Activision just doesn't care, never has, and doesn't even try to hide it.

Oh, btw my exp tracks too, and I'm on pc as well.

The complete list of the ""new"" skins which aren't working for me is:

\-Coalition-       Gaz, Domino, Mara, Wyatt, D-Day, Alice-Alliance-         Minotaur, Bale, Rodion, Azur, Grinch, Syd  


EDIT: so apparently they are visual bugs of past seasons' battlepass, lol. This game sure has gone to shit in a matter of months, all for the greed of those scumbags who just want us to play cold war and boost their new product."
"Same, can't advance on Domino mission, already reported it. Make sure to report it, the more people the better!"
i have the same issue. I can't manage to get these skins from the Operator missions
"Hi,

I'm having the same issue for the Domino Season 1 Vault bundle which I just bought a few days ago - assault rifle kills are not being registered for the 1st mission. If it is the case that the mission is no longer 'live' because it's a vault bundle, then the missions should have been removed by Activision as it's misleading. One of the reasons I got the bundle was for the additional mission skins. I've reported this on the Activision site but no reply so far"
"ADS always activates a laser even if you dont have it on your weapon.

turn your nightvision off or use a pistol they dont have lasers i think"
"Im using dual Rennettis so i would like to get that increase in hipfire from the 1mW laser without them seeing my laser, but thats not possible?"
[deleted]
It should say visible during night then
That's intentional
It might be but it doesnt make sense
"My dude, the 1mW laser is invisible _at daytime_. It says that in the attachment description. During night, all kinds of lasers are visible. Hope this helps."
See other posts.
Weapon XP has been broken for everyone since Friday. Activision and IW support are silent on this matter.
Do you have XMP enabled or your RAM o/c'd at all? I ask because since turning XMP off I've not had a dev error crash since. I didn't want to turn it off but for me at least it seems to be the price I have to pay for a crash-free experience with this game.
I'm not doing any overclocking at all. I can't play the game because as of right now I don't even have it. I uninstalled it and now CANNOT reinstall because battle.net errors on when trying to install. I'm working with their tech support back and forth for over 24 hours now and nothing they ask me to works so far. They are scheduling a phone call to work in real time.
It means that the next time they'll think twice before spending money to support CoD.
"The bans are random by the sound of it, I wouldn't spend on skins anyhow because they bin the game after just 1 year so hardly worth it. I did get the battle pass after saving enough CP."
"If they cheated who cares lol. 
If you didn't you can ask for a refund and get a full refund"
"Nope, if you didn't cheat and still got banned you get treat as if you were a cheater, that way Activision don't have to admit their anticheat doesn't work and start unbanning people"
It�s a bug. Hopefully a fix coming soon.
apparently there is some bug that makes it so that ya cant or extremely slowly level up ya weapons
I was wondering how long I�m gonna have to use the god damn red dot site on this thing. How do I fix it?
Do you not even try to find the answer before asking? How fucking helpless are you that you cant spend litterally 5 seconds scrolling down to see the hundred other posts before asking
What�s wrong buddy
"Based on other posts experiencing the same thing, I believe you may have been shadow-banned."
"Yeah I thought so too, but I don't encounter any cheaters from what I can tell. I also never cheated or used any programs, only play casually which also makes a shadowban unlikely"
What does this even mean? I always see this on my screen (in the lobby?) and I have no clue what it does
Double Nat?
"I'm not sure how to check that. I went from win 7 to 10 recently so I'm not sure if they have something weird with the firewall or if it's an isp issue at this point. about to give up honestly, I've never had so many connection problems with a game before."
"Honestly, it doesn't make any difference in mw, not sure why you'd bother. You could set up an exposed host on your router or just check what specific ports have to be forwarded for mw"
"I don't know, ever since it's been on moderate I'm having trouble finding lobbies and when I do it feels like I'm half a second behind every one, lag, get ""one shotted"" by 4 shot weapons, etc. never have this except for occasional packet loss on open."

"So true. I miss battlefield 4, and really any massive war game."
Mw is super messed up right now so some people aren't getting xp progression
Great. Thanks man
Weapon xp is broken. You cant gain any in multiplayer.
The fastest way to level any weapon is doing contracts in plunder and then going into mp once every camo slot is unlocked
Idid this for the JOKR last night. So much quicker!
"On console, last 3 games I�ve entered have glitched and lagged out completely."
I've had the same problem in the past I went however for me it went away on its own I suppose you could try deleting and re downloading but that might take a while
"I'm having this same issue, sometimes it gets worse when respawning -.-"
I was trying to get back into the game for the last week and every time I play o get the same problems. So dad cause this was honestly my favorite call of duty game
"Check and see if you are getting the three yellow or orange boxes on the left hand side of the screen, if so, that's packet burst. The game has been atrocious since the Cold War integration and I have this nonstop. It's game breaking"

"Your hardware, software or internet has no issues. MW and its servers are broken at the moment. I suggest to hold off playing right now considering that there's also a ton of other major bugs/issues like weapon level resets and no XP gain!"
Yup. Whenever I try and go for a tac/default sprint in the startup and throughout it are these tiny little stutters in the game where it freezes for a little bit.

Yup.
Deluxe edition of the game.
If it a battle pass skin then you won't be able get it.

I think you had to pre-order the game
"i think the update fricked everything up, my fps dropped too"
Okay I�m glad it wasn�t just me having the issues. A buddy of mine didn�t seem to have the issue at all and has a worse graphics card than mine so I was a bit confused but if it�s just the update fucking things up and COD breaking as it does than that�s less of an issue I guess
"Yes, plus shadow ban, plus another critical bugs. Raven broke the game completely."
"My game's been fine as far as video goes, but my audio keeps cutting in and out while I'm playing... quick thing, I keep tryna make posts about my audio issue, but the posts keep automatically getting taken down, and I donno how to reach out about it at this point..."
Yup it�s a bug just waiting on a update
"It's a glitch, you can earn camos but not WXP."
You can still level up in plunder until the bug is fixed
Yeah that seems to be faster anyways. Thanks!
It�s a major set of bugs since the update but you can level weapons in co-op special ops.
how do you not have the AMAX maxed out yet
Idk man i didn�t like it before but now it�s hittin
So glad you posted this because i hadn't noticed the other million posts mentioning the exact same thing for 2 days.
"To be fair, it is kind of alarming how so many major bugs have managed to crop up lately, including the poor hit detection and even lack of hit-markers in some instances."
Lmao hating on other peoples posts too.    Delete Reddit or go to r/nobodyasked - that's definitely your type
Very helpful thanks

"""You have hair implants"" fucking killed me"
IKR lmao
Good shit but what marksman rifle is that
"Thanks mate, it's a mix. Mainly AX-50 and SP-R but I think there's one clip in there with the Kar98"
"Spoiler, he got the box of �whoops all F-words!�"
If I could still record voices on console I�d give mw another go honestly
"The missions all disappeared with the Cold War/ WarZone season 2 updates.
I must admit I�m pissed of by this. I was so hyped by the idea of unlocking all those skins."
Even they didn't offer another way to unlocking those skins.
"i tried the same Missons - not Tracking at all. 

But the Cold War Skins have started to Track in Warzone (Adler) which did not work for me until now. 

I do Not own CW so i thought this was Game related - maybe the Progression is halted/bugged because it�s now tracking CW Skins instead."
"Oh they finally made the CW operator missions track in Warzone? fucking finally, it took em no less then 2 months"
It�s just a bug. You don�t need to have any of that bundle crap it should track the same way daily challenges would track infinity ward just needs to fix it
"They're glitched challenges from the season 1 pass, they'll probably unlock if you buy the season 1 bundles that are probably going to release soon"
"Are they season 1? They dont have any season on them as opposed to the other 3 sets of operator challenges on screen, and the other 3 all mention which season they are"
I have some Iskra and Mara missions im trying to do. 15 kills with a SMG is Maras and deploy munitions box 5 times is Iskras. Ive done the munitions box one in 1 match in WZ and then tried 5 separate matches in multiplayer and none tracked. I then tried Maras 15 kills with a SMG and didn't track.
"So its only tracking in warzone? Ill try it i guess, around the time all the CW guns were put in i stopped playing WZ, felt some guns were way too OP and others totally nerfed, guess its time to jump back in, thanks ill try it"
"I have the exact same problem, opened a ticket about it.  Then I just realized that absolutely none of my missions are tracking.  Went into missions and all of them are at 0 and not tracking."
I�m having the same exact issue with my Mara operator. I�ve been told that eventually Activision will recognize my completed missions but it�s been about a week now and it�s frustrating lol. Cause I swear I�ve done the SMG mission 30 times.
"Im having the same issue with the season 1 missions that popped up recently as well as Cold War season 1 operators off the battle pass. I don�t own MW/Cold war. I notice that for certain operators like gaz/woods/sims they track perfectly fine until the mission itself contains MW/Cold war specific tasks like �call in 5 scorestreaks or killstreaks� for sims. �Paranoia or high alert� for woods.  �Tomahawk or throwing knife� for gaz. Anything involving general eliminations with weapons or winning a fight as a prisoner seemed to track for me

Bug I�m assuming like the rest of you. Hoping it gets fixed ASAP. 

Disappointing that the season 1 missions also mostly require you to own multiplayer. 

Edit, also didn�t own the season 1 battle pass. I started season 4 if I recall"
"Are they offering Season 1 skins to late players? If you started in season 4, you shouldn't be able to get Season 1 skins, that just defeats the purpose of making those skins exclusive to day 1 players."
"Yea I noticed that I had missions for Mara season one, ""get 15 smg kills as Mara"" didn't track. Had another for Wyatt, something along the lines of using tac insert 5 times, didn't track also. If they haven't fixed it yet, I dout they will."
Same with Mara. I always wanted the og skins for her but didn�t get the game in time to get season 1. Have a battle pass skin of hers but saw the operator missions today had appeared on her screen but I�m not getting any progress. The first one is to win a TDM with her as your operator. I won three in a row and got nothing.
Same here. I'm never buying an Activision game again if I can help it.
"Yea theyre really dropping the ball trying to funnel sales for cold war which isnt half as good as MW, i gave up on COD for years before for less than this bullshit"
"An update appeared today when I started the game 1 hour ago. I�ll give a try tonight.

Edit : Still no tracking - after update - 12th February at 8PM (Paris Time)"
"Yea, apparently IW has given up on MW in an attemot to funnel gamers into buying Cold War from what ive been reading on this reddit"
I'm stuck aswell. Can't complete any objective on any operator but dailies and weapon missions work just fine. If anyone finds a solution i'd be glad to hear.
Same I don�t see operator missions
"cant do my s6 operator challenges as well.

use dead silence with domino and use ammo box with zane are not tracking to be precise"
Yeah I have absolutely no indication of how to activate or progress any of these
Doesn�t work for me either
Same for Maria and Minotaur operator missions one to get 15 lmg kills and the other to get 15 smg kills.
"I just read on here that xp for weapons and battle pass isny even tracking, which i havent noticed because i havent played last few days, funny tho because last time i played i got like 45 kills in hardpoint and i remember thinking ""why did i get so little XP?"", prolly didnt get ANY, seems like MW is practically obsolete in the eyes of Treyarch or IW(whatever onr it is) now that Cold war is out"
"Same, still not tracking. Also sometimes I don't get any exp after game aswell."
"I have some mission for Mara, Minotaur and others from Season 1. But i never played season 1 and didnt have battle pass back then. Still i have this missions ""Active"", but the progress is not tracking."
Yup. Same.
As of season 2 update alot of the bugged operator missions that werent working like ronin wyatt rodion grinch etc are now gone which kinda sad was hoping id be able to get to do them idk if we ever will or of theyll be released when they release modern warfare season 7 in march
I don�t know if they are trying to fix it but now the new season is here i can�t even find the operator missions anymore
"Same thing with Wyatts ""use 5 tactical insertion field upgrade"" mission from season 2MW, and Azurs ""Use 3 emp drone field upgrades"" also from season 2 MW...

Did you have to complete them during the battle pass or something??
Annoying AF"
"Also stuck on the 3 emp one -_-"""
"I am having an issue getting the new Stone skin that requires C4 kills. Already unlocked the other blue skin with red gasmask goggles on plunder. (I don�t have cw). I have killed downed peeps with c4, never worked. Also blew up a guy with 2 c4s, didn�t register either as it only downed him. Was gonna try the heli c4 trick, but it�s not easy to trap people like that anymore. Any tips?"
This game is glitchy af. Trying to do the 5 aerial kills with a launcher. It does not work. It also doesn't tell you if you're on the right type or mode or anything. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong tho
Sims operator last mission not tracking?? Anyone else?
My knee!
"It's a visual bug, however there are 2 Vault packs for her that haven't been released yet, they unlock those skins. No way would they let paid skins be somehow achieved for free bugged or not."
"Aw, man. So I can't unlock them like the way in my post?"
Same here. I actually have 2 challenges. This one and another that starts off with getting 15 SMG kills. No idea on a fix either
"damn, this is so ridiculous lol"
"i dont think there are any blueprints for those guns that have a unique obsidian look. i have only seen that unique obsidian on the mp5, m13 and aug"
"If that's your fav gun, just do it and have fun. Obsidian looks very unique and blueprints don't makes a difference since I have tried them on my AK and CR 56. Also all attachment gets obsidian not like Damascus. I'm having fun with launchers lol. Rpg kills, feels bad man."
Ayo that was dope.
Thanks dude
I kinda like Aniyah on GW. Promenade on the other hand...
"I think Aniyah's great on 24v24, wish there were more maps like it tbh. Like more infantry based and dense"
Man I wish I could delete this map lol
Yea would be nice if they let us choose by filter or vote for the map
"Every patch for any game will have bugs 


Now before downvoters show up ima say this 



They aren�t sabotaging your game people they could cut all servers for MW and just display the buy screen of Cold War then they would IW has left this game in the dust with ravensoft doing their own work on Warzone 


They are not sabotaging your game you just say that so you�ll feel happy about yourself this game has ran its life cycle and they�ve moved onto Cold War and after Cold War they are gonna move to cod 2021 and so on 




The conspiracy�s are stupid as hell"
"absolutely correct. it has nothing to do with pushing people to cold war, because they�re aware 2 million people are still playing this game at every moment. Why would they break a game to push people to an even more broken game?
As for the bugs, i think they�re just poor execution and lazy devs. nobody bothered to test it before releasing the patch. I still think the way they�re handling this is ridiculous. It�s been over 48 hours and there�s still no repair patch or any kind of solution. also, these fuckers took out Shoot The Ship, so fuck them for that too. literally take away  one of the only map playlists the community liked."
It is a claim with hardly any evidence really. The game devs are extremely lazy.
"It's because Activision has morphed into the corporate incarnation of the Boogey Man breathing down our necks going ""Buy. Cold. War. Buy. Cold. War."" trying to push us from MW to CW with not so subliminal messaging. MW is not a priority, they will allow these bugs to persist in a futile effort to push those of us who aren't interested in CW to purchase it."
"The only bug im concerned about is the shadowbanning, i cannot play neither mw2019 or warzone bc of this and is really depressing."
"As of the update that dropped this week, weapons XP is not being given in MW multiplayer games especially on console. This was just one of several bugs introduced and they have not been fixed yet. You can earn camos but you can�t level up your weapons"
"Wow that�s stupid, thanks for the information"
yeah xp bug with this update lmfao. activision are trying to compete with rockstar now
"Same, been using and lmg for hours and only managed to get 35 xp"
All guns bro. It�s a known issue since the patch
I haven�t tried to level up anything else but thanks
What the fuck was that??
"The invisible/god mode glitch that first appeared with the gunships is back, unknown if its only in the armored quads playlist though."
"Looked like a bunch of kills to me, idk what you mean

I watched the first minute and the last minute and it has nothing to do with the title... waste of time"
"I've posted the clip from when I first ran into these guys, you can see the HVT target but not the player model. Watch that then try and say the kills in this clip aren't suspect"
sick
Is this how u play every game?
Sometimes I play to have a good time and chill sometimes i sweat
"As of the update that dropped this week, weapons XP is not being given in MW multiplayer games especially on console. This was just one of several bugs introduced and they have not been fixed yet. You can earn camos but you can�t level up your weapons"
sounds about right. thanks!
Yes as it TWstEK84 said Activison like always is Not able to update something without issues
i figured. thanks for the confirmation
[deleted]
I�ll try it out now. Thanks!
There�s an xp glitch for everyone nothing is leveling up. At the rate it�s going it�ll be patched next month. Sorry mate.
you gotta be fucking me lmao
I wasted an hour long weapon xp token. Just great
I used like 4 lmao
Found someone else�s on the ground and used that. Seemed to shake the glitch loose. Worked normally after I did that.
Ill give that one a shot and let ya know if its works
I was so confused at this point glad this clears things up
Yes
Same - this is so annoying
I am having it with the SP-R 208. It's stuck at level 39
I do the exact same switch between gunfight and warzone usually go to gunfight as I get destroyed in warzone
Where did you see the devs are working on a fix?
Im just assuming they are; since this is a huge failure they�ve made .
You can run co-op and get some good experience as well.
This glitch has been going on for 3 days btw how can we get someone's attention to fix this
6 days now?
Don't worry guys day 7 ! Wooo billion dollar company BTW
"Just got on tonight, fixed for me in the new update."
"Omfg! I literally thought this was just happening to me. Nobody else I play with is experiencing this and when I looked it up the only posts I saw were from a year ago! I waited an hour and a half to talk to support and they had no idea. 

Also, I love how they just gave up on Modern Warfare. To them, if you�re not playing Cold War or warzone, you can just go f*** yourself. It took them months to fix the bug to revive in cyber attack. Never seen a company give up on a game so fast! At least No Man�s Lie worked on their game to make it better."
"out of the 15 people I regularly played MW with before Cold War, only 2 of them switched over to CW and they dont even play it often."
Still happening i was windering wtf was wrong and why my fennec wasnt leveling. Ffs. Godd so broken
I have been having this issue the last 3 days. Any update on the issue?
Guys they fixed it now in a recent update. You should be able to gain xp and actually have fun or whatever people do on this game nowadays.
"Its a bug in multiplayer that they are fixing!
The best way to level up guns is to do Supply runs in Plunder WZ!"
I�d rather eat a bowl or spider webs than play plunder
Would you please provide a link/source to where anyone official from Activision or Infinity Ward has stated they are working on a fix specifically for this issue with no XP being gained. I can't find anywhere where they have even acknowledged this problem.
"Don't listen to this dude, hes been spamming this same shit in other threads. Activision bot or some shit"
i did 5 supply runs in a single plunder match and gained ONE level on my m4....
I�m currently getting the same no rank xp or weapon xp
I wasted 3 XP tokens before I noticed
"While sad to hear, glad I'm not the only one. Started yesterday when I redownloaded the game, grinded for hours to unlock the new marksman rifle, games wouldn't be counted despite the fact I knew I had achieved the 2 longshot headshot kills, eventually unlocked it, and after a few hours of play today and a double XP token, I realized it was locked at lvl 1 with 388 XP, wouldn't move at all. And I refuse to play Warzone, cannot stand it, hopefully it's fixed soon and there's some form of recompense or another"
"I bought Modern warfare 3 days to get XP/skins on my guns faster than in Warzone, and now I have 300 kills with my M4A1 and it's only level 11... When I bought Modern warfare my gun was in level 8/9.. only rarely get a tiny amount of XP..."
Yea I currently have a level 37 AK with almost 700kills :)
My bruen mk9 was at 830xp out of whatever and then I do a match with 22 kills and its still 830xp. This game has been out for over a year and there's still new bugs every single week. WTF IS WRONG WITH THEM!!!!
"I was encountering the same issue, after switching to the warzone main menu and checking the exp of the weapon there, it resolved in MW Multiplayer as well"
">I was encountering the same issue, after switching to t

I wish that worked for me lol"
Do you guys think when/if they fix it that the guns will gain all the XP that they would have gotten or you have to start from where they got stuck at?
"Well I would sure hope so, but I feel like if they've been this incompetent for this long that they probably wouldn't put in the effort to fix that"
I thought I was the only one as well
"Clear Cache, worked for me"
"I used some Weapon XP tokens because I thought it was just going slower, I hope I get reimbursed"
"I've been trying to work in game time on night shift, every morning I've played, no xp, trying to finish the DLC weapons and nothing is gaining. Any resolution to this yet?"
Same here!
[deleted]
*Surgical with those knives*
This playlist is a gift from the gods. Has that old school cod4 custom game feel
What game mode is this?
All or nothing
How long ago was this? I see XP! Did they fix the XP?!
Still broken for me
Special olympics league lobby confirmed
"Not at all, I was getting spanked in this game"
It's been happening to tons of console players. It's because of the new update
"Bruh, I'm on pc though.  :("
I'm on PC and have been having this glitch with the FiNN LMG.
Same here on all guns :( no fix from activision yet
Damn... I guess I can grind for obsidian in the meantime. Does exp still work for camos?
"Its a bug in multiplayer that they are fixing!
The best way to level up guns is to do Supply runs in Plunder WZ!"
"Gotchya. Haven't played Plunder in a while, but I reckon I can give it a whirl."
"Best way to achieve crippling the companies for doing shit we don�t like? Don�t buy their coming products, 100% nothing, that�ll teach them a lesson.

If we all gang up and not spend a single $ on CW or future titles, it will massively impact their figures, thus causing them to actually comply with what�s being asked. 

While a petition will bring light to a little problem, the over arching will still exist."
"They dont give a fuck if the people on the subreddits don't buy their game. We're a tiny tiny portion of the playerbase. They're catering to the masses, not to us hardcore fans. We tried this with the cold war battlepass. The huge majority of the playerbase didn't even know we were trying to boycott"
I know but a petition can show how many people do like the already existing game and don't actually want to pay for another one.
Save MW from what?
from the bugs it's facing now and the clearly lack of attention from the devs. It's also because I hate Activision to use the name Call of Duty as an easy cash grab everytime. I mean there game are fun but would it be more fun to continue supporting the game 1 or 2 years after it came out?
Same
Same here as well!

slander... in cod.. report...? you must be new to the game
It's just an xp bug we're all  hoping IW fixes it
"i don�t think they�re still in charge MW2019 tbh. if they are, they�ve probably abandoned it."
"Its a bug in multiplayer that they are fixing!
The best way to level up guns is to do Supply runs in Plunder WZ!"
I felt the ranking system in was broken when cw season 1 started
Its just a mag in the shape of a circle
Aha that one. Thank you
Use the ak-47
Unfortunately it's not leveled up enough. I still have 2 locked mags and the one unlocked doesn't say Drum.
The kilo has a 100 round drum magazine along with the Jack 12 and the origin.
I'll check it out. Thanks
"you have to unlock it to see it.   you need to have a gun unlocked enough to use it.   The Ak, some LMGs etc have it"
Thank you. Turns out i haven't unlocked it yet lol
I believe maybe the origin or jak shotguns have drum mags too
Alright thanks!
I got shadowbanned with a lot of other people. Day by day the lobbies get smaller. Feels like purgatory. Played 1 on 1 Dom. on Arklov peak today. My God. I'm taking a break for a while.
"They have made the game into dogshit now. I got shadow banned too on the patch day. Lobbies are awful. I just want to play the game I paid for.

Never cheated in a multiplayer game in my life. Seriously shocked to wake up to that.

I started live streaming gameplay of this game a week ago, and was having a lot of fun on Shoot The Ship. Made a lot of progress on my camo grind to Damascus.

These morons don't make an anti cheat detection, and instead they just lowered the report threshold and banned tens of thousands of legit players it seems.

I am so pissed off and sad right now. I streamed two sessions in these dogshit lobbies and it is pretty awful overall."
"how can you tell if you've been shadowbanned?  i've noticed i'm alla sudden being put into lobbies with people i've previously blocked (who i suspected were cheating.)  am i being put in cheater lobbies?!  that would be dumb, i'm like a 10-kill-per-Ground-War-match guy."
"Another shadowbanned player here. My k/d is average at best, 1.45.
I guess I was reported a lot?

I tried talking to other guys in the lobby and it seems like there's a ton of people who have no idea what is happening to them and why the game is throwing them into high ping lobbies. Between that and lots of shadowban posts here and on activision forums, it is a goddamn disaster. Seems like they've lowered threshold for a number of reports that are required to be put into low-priority/suspected cheater queues. 

If these are reviewed on player to player basis(which I highly doubt to be honest), with the number of innocent players that have reported being banned it might take them longer than usual 7 days  to get us of the hook this time.

With absolutely bugged update and this shadowban nonsense... What an absolute shitshow."
"That's the new 1v1 Derail.

Sounds crappy, sorry to hear they broke you. :("
"I think nearly everyone got shadow banned. My friend irl are in PS and Xbox are all experiencing it and they are not playing competitively or making money from it. You know just get together and play as best a possible as they got kids. I noticed that it seems like we are playing different region, e.g. I spoke to one player who has 30 ping and I'm at 200ping. He told me he is from Europe. What are the chances that the west coast servers are offline for maintenance or all SUS players get together and they gather the data reporting to finalizet he ban. Yes there are blatant cheaters still u fortunately speaking. Also, fps drops at least 20 to 30 fps and ingame audio cuts in and out as well."
"In multi, im in lobbies with Koreans and Chinese folks. Takes couple minutes to join too. They broke this game"
"I uninstalled the campaign mp and just left zombies for cold war and still just playing that I have problems with mw lobbys 
For no reason at all I don't think I'm shadow banned I just have to wait to find out. I can't see my hip fire reticle,blue v for vlk doesn't load all the time, I feel like the game has been in a state of disarray since the announcement of cold war integration and I thought that it might have been a good idea but no."
"Same here, the only answer i got was ""your account is under review"" and never got an ETA on when i will be able to play normally again. I have a KDR of 1.71 on mw and around 1.4 in warzone, but i've never cheated. At this point is just wait until the veredict."
Went on a two week break from modern warfare. Enjoyed sniping and playing in multiplayer. Came back after the update and now the games gone to shit. Hit detections non existent. I can't fucking see hitmarkers and die cuz I'm too used to adjusting my aim untill I see a hitmarker. What's funny is I renewed my psn just so I can play a little cod and now that's gone to waste. I hate this game
"Yeah, it feels so weird to play aggressive with the sniper since this last update, like you feel like you are gonna miss every shot you are gonna take. This ruins your confidence and makes you play so bad. You cant even focus for a one single game"
Also playing splitscreen will cause the game to crash as you enter a game
This is happening to me too! Will let me play multiplayer but as soon as you try split screen it refuses to go past the loading screen without crashing
"Same here, my wife and I play since season 1, on season 4 the load out of player 2 stopped showing the previews, and now we can no longer even play, it's bullcrap"
"Literally the only reason I have COD for is split screen and Activision fucked it. At least, I know what I�ll be uninstalling soon..."
Is anyone else�s game freezing every time the complete a match of warzone and/or multiplayer
"Not exactly, but the game froze twice midmatch for me in Warzone and the morning after the update I couldn't play an MP match without it crashing. Seems to have mostly cleared up for me now (fingers crossed) but I'm getting into some terribly sweaty lobbies."
"https://reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/ldhqdl/_/gm6wabw/?context=1

Looks like they know about it. Hopefully a fix comes sooner than later"
"Looked into, but doesn't say if they're doing anything about it.  At least that's the way I read it."
This shit should never have happened in the first place.
My reticles will not load in a normal multiplayer match
Yeah. Can�t quick scope with hdr at all
Wouldn't be surprised if Activision is doing this on purpose
"I�m done with cod. Activision can go fuck themselves, I am not giving them another cent. This is just ridiculous that on top of them shoving CW down our throats they also made MW unplayable. Idc how good future cods are, I am done giving them money to fuck us over all the time."
"I'm 1 level away from Skulls on ak-47, with that being my last camo for Damascus. And I go on a course for the next 6 months on Sunday. 
Please just fix the XP problem so I can get Damascus before I go."
"I�m in the exact same position. My only need skulls on jokr and ak47, but can�t level the guns anymore and just when I had a week off."
I had the same problem with the p90 after the update so i started doing some mission challenges and noticed my AX sniper rifle was progressing. Went back to the p90 and it started updating.
"Yeah its a tough spot. Cold war doesn't even work for me and when I got back into MW, I get to play for about a match or so and I get disconnected. Never fails. Sucks that they are killing this game."
I literally bought the game the night of the update to level up and unlock warzone weapons. So i can't play the game for the primary reason i purchased it lol
Shadowbanned <\3
Man I think I might be aswell after reading this thread
"You're right, this update literally had nothing to do with Modern Warfare. 

And it broke the game.

Hit markers, aim assist, hit detection all don't work anymore.

Reinfected Ground War times out nearly 50% of the time due to host connection issues making it nearly impossible to enjoy / play."
Don�t forget the invisibility glitch
"dude the only new thing is this!

when you start the game, it shows iw, activision, treyarch and all the devs list appears right

there, they added a smoke effect which didnt exist lmaoooo"
"Anyone else also only get late games? Like matches in progress? (KD is 1.24 if that helps, yeah i know its low)"
"At this point, I think they're purposely adding in bugs to make us switch to Cold War."
"I don�t see why it just can�t be like it was before, if they knew they were going to end MWs life cycle, end up continuing Warzone with CW, why is it all integrated so badly? 

Here�s a crazy simple solution. 

MW on all platforms becomes a standalone game once again, revert the leveling back to the way it was where once you hit 155 that�s it since the game is losing speed and will just be another yearly cod to most, and since we probably won�t see anymore seasons

Warzone either becomes a standalone or integrated into CW where that leveling and such is tied together but leaves MW alone, then when we see COD 2021 Warzone (If alive by then) will be integrated into that title

They can�t make their mind up it seems and it causes mass confusion, shitty uix bugs, ugly menu selections and so much more issues than need be"
"It's been a few days, how is the weapons xp bug still not fixed? How is this even a thing? Isn't that a critical issue?"
"I've not played MW since just after CW was released. I loved playing it with my friends, it was a blast. But I see so many posts about how it's been abandoned & broken by the devs since CW, is it still worth playing? I'm not happy about all my progress being reset either. No idea why that happened."
Honestly there's been updates in the past thatvw broken tge fame too like I remember almost a week at one point I couldn't even matchmake because it'd shoot to 250ms ping and just stay there searching. I only play plunder on mw really though.
"If I were you, I would just wait for a new update tbh"
My guns won�t level up anymore... I�m so aggravated with call of duty and there�s nothing on their support on how to maybe fix the problem
Is anyone surprised they sabotaged the better one because cold war is shit?
Weapon xp hasn�t registered. Weapons stuck on level 9. Which is ass for my friend bc he barely started.
Same here!!! Trying to unlock gold camo on every AR but my weapon levels are completely stuck
I want IW to platinum all my launchers to atone for this atrocity. Just the launchers though.
"Loaded up MW for the first time since Morte came out, and the fact that the game literally doesn't even mention Modern Warfare until the main menu (after multiple splash screens and even the game cover tile on the Xbox dashboard) is somewhere between laughably pathetic and shockingly scummy

Warzone can fuck right off, but holy shit stop trying *so fucking hard* to ram two entirely separate products down my throat that I do not in any way want, to such a pathetically desperate degree that *the game I'm literally playing* is the absolute lowest priority in every menu and graphic

If I wanted to play Warzone or Cold War, *I'd fucking play them*"
"I honestly just want the Battle Royale craze to die and stay dead for a long while. Warzone is easily the best BR game out there imo, but the way they force it down our throats is just terrible practice. Now I got Cold War on PC it's not as much of an hassle because it actually downloads fast, but playing Modern Warfare on PS4 was torture, knowing that whenever a new update for Warzone came out I'd have to download 50GB from the atrociously slow PSN servers. In other words, I'd have to leave the console on for an entire day just to download the update. That was ridiculous, and because of a game I don't even play, I just wanted to play Modern Warfare."
Activision threw down their best COD title since MW2 (and the first decent one since BO2) in favour of the insanely subpar BOCW and the Warzone moneyprinter. They got me hooked and let me down. I uninstalled yesterday. I just feel stupid for ever thinking things would go differently.
"Warzone has been a pain since it released. I don't mind the mode, but the fact that it's forever attached to this game is ridiculous. The least they could do is let us uninstall it like they do other modes. People who bought the game full price can't uninstall the free to play portion they don't want, but we have the option to uninstall all of the MW content."
"Played MW the other day. 

The first match I got put into, every player but me had a M&K and I had 230ping..

I just shut the game down lmfao"
welcome to the shadow banned for no reason club pal
Yes that�s exactly right.
Was weapon xp broken with the update? I was getting a few levels for a low level gun a game but now I'm only getting about 250 xp a game
I�m not getting xp now which makes for a great time. Bleh
Same. Stuck at 73 on battlepass for 3 days now. So aggravated
The opposite of hello games....NMS.
"bro i got two wins in two days but its only counted my losses, fuck me this game is broken, also invisible glitch"
" I played 5 matches of team deathmatch and in none of them did I win xp, it is very frustrating to see this happening and they do not give the least attention"
"I think i got shadow banned, i live in brazil and the game is throwing me in NA/EU servers with cheaters and stuff"
Bro my PS4 keeps saying modern warfare corrupted and tells me to delete it and reinstall it but like everything works fine I can play the game offline and online but sometimes during mid game it tells me it�s corrupted and to delete. Anyone else?
"I was playing BOCW for a bit due to the issues; only bought it because it was on sale and couple buddies were playing it.  I had taken a long hiatus from gaming(according to Steam, 5 years, but got back into it since my other hobby is getting expensive(cars)).  Now, they don't even play it anymore and I still hate the gameplay compared to MW.  Back to Civ6 and Forest for me.  Can't wait for the next BF though."
"Same bro, can�t gain xp for my guns and my level"
and cold war is so much worse than the mw base game on release
"If  I remember correctly, I did pay for MW too, right? And spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on skins, on my account and my sons account. If Activision is just scrapping the whole game, just to keep CODBO afloat, then I would like a refund of my purchases then."
Anyone else having issues where they make changes to their weapons in warzone and it doesn�t save?
"guys is there a discord or reddit to coordinate private lobbies?

they don't give us shoothouse 24/7 at least we can play it in private lobbies."
The hit marker bug is out 5+ days and still not fixed. Embarrassing
"Okay can someone pls help me, I�m on PS4 and I have around 80GB of free space, but the game keeps saying I need to make like 25GB more of space??"
Fucking hate warzone. Ruining mw and cold war. My Mara challenges aren't working. Still bugged.
"Am I the only one that�s lagging like hell? Ever since the update, I can�t even stay in a match without lagging out."
"For a game that cost a fair chunk of change at release and to this day is still $60 for this level of support across its player base is astounding in that they release game breaking patches for a game they're providing to the public for free. 

I just can't understand the logic of bending over backward to fix issues in a free game when you have a ""semi-loyal"" player base who've paid for a game which barely functions and more or less these issues go ignored. At the very least be a little more transparent and publicly acknowledge the issue not just on social.media but as a message to players in game recognising the problem and assure steps are being taken to rectify the issue.

Literally the paying player base keeps the lights on and are the reason Activision has posted best ever profits. Have the decency to at least give the player base the perception of decent treatment. We all know  the problems aren't because you can't afford to pay your staff to fix the issues or your communications department to properly acknowledge the problems."
"For a company that made a net profit of 8 billion (that is billion with a b) in 2020, how is it that with virtually every update they manage to break something in game. I have played about 5 or 6 matches since the update and received only 300 xp. This is absolutely pathetic!!!!!"
BRING BACK SHOOT THE SHIP
Better yet Dirty Ol House Boat! Or Rust Issues
[removed]
You probably have the game installed on your internal hard drive and that is where it is trying find space to download the update. You could move some games off the internal drive to get some more space.
I ended up taking fort away and putting it in the external
Same for me and i dont know why
I had to give fortnite the boot but then I could reinstall it
You need around  x2.5 times the space needed in order to update a game on playstation
Ewwwww he got cw
Oh fuck off fella at least I don't have to actively fucking look around for players just to be instantly fucking melted by the WIDE range of broken shotguns
"im not crazy then, my xp counter stuck for like 6-7 games, and i was randomly getting pop ups in game that i leveled up n+1 (n being the next level) on top of this"
"Thats really strange, im on PC so it must be server at this point. First horrible netcode and now this, im installing cold war to see if the problem is still there."
At least you temporarily gave him a fright. Every cloud.
Sense too high/aim assist off or bad setting?
"I don�t think it was that, as I�ve done really well with this class before

I just didn�t expect to see them there and it made me a bit too sensitive"
I felt this
Me with the famas 24/7
Alex zedra looks like Alex zedra shocking
I want Alex zedra to sit on my face till I die
i will call the simp police to take you to horny jail
after you die it's my turn... heh heh DOH!
I just wanna know why they butchered her face so badly.
"True, Alex Zedra so much nicer IRL.  I check her twitch stream from time to time."
She said on live stream once that they got her makeup wrong or not quite right and it came out that way when they scanned her or something.
"Any resemblance living or dead is purely coincidental, check and mate! Jk I don�t care."
"The guy who is suing is a jackass. The idea that he owns her look, or how she looks in tactical gear is absurd. That�s either going to be tossed out outright or he�s gonna be made to look like an idiot in court. 

Don�t even get me started on him trying to claim legal culpability because, dare I say, they used external images of her as part of their reference board for the character. Something that�s done in all media including games, movies and television in preliminary concepting stages. 

Lindsay Lohan had more of a claim than this guy, and she didn�t have shit."
"This is the only post I could find about this, and I was surprised. I figured a lawsuit involving this game would be more prominent on this subreddit, but I guess not? Unless I'm out of the loop on something"
There are a few other ezines or blogs that have it but seriously it about a video game and/or a model's look.  Mara is my favorite Operator other than the Cap'n so I'd rather not lose her to some dumb lawsuit.
"Summed up in one pic, and probably the difference maker in the suit: https://i.imgur.com/lbjZUbn.jpg

Activision got lazy and used the photographer's lazy and generic style, but they probably could have gotten away with it if they hadn't used his material."
"Have to wonder what Ms. Zedra has to say about it?  TBH she's made quite the bundle from her own ""brand"" after being modeled for Mara."
"If they used his photograph and published them as a character then he has a case.  


If however, he took photos of her with a gun (one of i'm guessing 1000's out there) and he is claiming that other photos look like his then he isn't going to get very far.  


That's like saying somebody taking a photo of Timothy Olyphant as a US Marshal in something then claiming they used the same idea for every other time he was a Marshal."
"Like the Olyphant's character in Disney's Mandalorian perhaps? (hint, hint)"
"I just wanted you to know that I upvoted you for the random Justified reference, which is my favorite series of all time. Good work, dude."
"> If they used his photograph and published them as a character then he has a case.

Activision used a photo he took for Call of Duty marketing material.

Left is Call of Duty's, right is the Photographer's original photo: https://i.imgur.com/lbjZUbn.jpg"
Imagine dying to a teammate before getting it
"Now this is another clip I love watching, snipers are boring by comparison."
i personally just find it hilarious lol. normally i wouldn't use the riot shield but i'm working towards damascus
"Good news though!

Blizzard will sell your personal information, make a lot more money from you, and cause you continued issues well into the future!"
I wouldn't exoect anything else
Sounds like you got hacked
"Yeah, went thro my emails. Last night some twat stole it."
"Sadly yes. This happened to me as well, had to relink accounts and pretty much start over. If you had any payed for content get ready to say goodbye. Been trying for a month now to contact anyone with a pulse at Treyarch to get my rank & bundles but absolutely nothing. Also, super sorry it happened to you, but if I were you I�d either A. Buy a new game or B. Start over fresh, because Activison/Blizzard are NOT giving you anything back, they want to sweep legitimately hacked players under the rug to avoid a PR security breach mess."
"I've noticed this and think thay black ops has its own system, MW has its own and now WZ does as well."
Download the cod companion app friend. Its the best way to see the accurate information
"unlike the other comments, I'll jump in to say that, yes, I too see a consistently changing level in game.  I was level 1010 before they smashed everything together, but my level now is all over the map.  I've been almost exclusively playing shoot the ship for the last two weeks and my level can seemingly change from match to match.  Just another stupid fuckup by the evil, greedy fucks at Activision."
"Yeah, like today for me;

- Logged on, was level 1 for way too long than just a few �loading seconds�

- Turned back to lv47, queued up for some matches

- Turned into lv 102?? In the lobby

- Turned BACK to 47 when match had started but my UI had the rank 1 Private logo

How broken does a code have to be in order for them to have this done seemlessly in all previous games but have it be a sloppy mess once you integrated CW with no apparent fix on the way"
uploading for you now
"Thanks you man, holding on."
i think its called in by the losing side because that side has already lost and nuking everything will destroy most of the winning sides forces
"If a team holds all flags for 30 seconds I think it is then a nuke drops and the match ends, that way it's not a slog where it's 15+ mins of having no flags. In other words, it forces the losing team to stop camping and capture a flag"
"The poster is asking about the in-game implications of the nuke being dropped, etc."
"Why did you stim at the start? That seems like a waste. Does it give you some sort of benefit?

Good clip though"
it resets your tactical sprint and allows you to cover twice the distance in half the time
This was nice lol
Unrelated but maybe someone can answer me. The first calling card that appears on screen(girl with sunglasses holding a rifle)how do you get that?
[deleted]
Only on keyboard and mouse
I did this the other day. Usually I�ll jump across just to be in guard if people are midland and a guy was on there mount. 1 tap from the Uzi and it killed him lol
Holy accuracy. Love it.
Thanks! One of my proudest moments ever in cod haha
Lol this is funny. I get in these lobbies all the time as well. I don�t lag though.
Well that�s racist. How do you know they�re Mexican? Wasn�t aware you could tell someones country of origin over a mic just by hearing Spanish.
"I agree, and tbh the most racist part isn�t OP assuming these players are Mexican because they are speaking Spanish. It�s OP�s assertion that *because* they speak Spanish, *they cannot possibly be located at or near wherever OP lives.*"
M4 my dude. Super versatile weapon you can use as a secondary to a sniper OR a long range beamer with an SMG or Shotgun. I use it as a standalone weapon with ghost as well. It�s super easy to control the recoil too.
AK all the way
"Grau, easy"
"They are very similar but they differentiate in two areas when considering the common meta loadouts for both guns. Kilo slightly edges out the grau upclose and the grau dominates at farther ranges in comparison. But if you consider running into an opponent and ADS-ing at the same time the grau is better, the kilo just makes you slower. So overall in most scenarios using the grau is better. The main situations where you'd want a kilo over a grau is if you are ADS upclose holding down a lane, but this is a case you wouldn't normally want to be in because you'd mostly lose against people using their smg"
Kilo and m13
"If its just wz it's def grau, no dmg drop off like the kilo, better visual recoil and less first shot recoil, better ads. But you're gonna have to out play your enemies instead of taking them on 50/50s. CW and others faster ttk weapons are too good."
1. wrong sub 2. Kilo
Grau
"I don�t know why people are surprised MW isn�t getting very many updates anymore. Literally every year the old game is phased out in favor of the new one. The old one gets more content, but not too much more. That�s kinda just how they�ve been doing it. Except for the anomaly that was BO3, which for whatever reason actually kept getting updated for a while which is interesting."
"Well they�re using it for warzone, it�s literally MW�s engine. That�s never been done before. They�re using MW to promote Cold War which is way inferior. Kinda dumb"
"then why Black ops 4 still visible in blizzard and everywhere

casual players can still buy BO4.. 

but they won't even notice that there's another game named modern warfare exists anywhere.. unless the launch warzone and then at the corner modern warfare is there"
"Apparently it might update tonight, idk for sure tho but at this point I don�t expect them to be on time with updates anymore."
I got a 12gb update on PS4. Think it goes live at 7am (UK time).
I heard the update might be coming tonight at 11 man
Just wait till the fall when the new cod comes in and gets added in to the three game progression system with warzone and mw will be completely dead and Cold War will be pushed aside but on the positive hopfilly it�s modernwarfare 2
"Really doubt about the MW2 but could be the only way to save this fricking titanic for the fanbase. Just add a new campaign, new mutiplayers modes, new gimmick mode. and stay with the same engine."

"Honestly when I started playing this game I had a similar experience. My aim felt off, and my reaction time felt so much slower than everyone else�s. This is normal. This is why Infinity Ward had safe spaces within the game that would allow a person to �camp� if necessary. But don�t fret. Once you play longer, unlock more equipment, and tweak the aim assist options to your liking, you�ll feel like you understand the mechanics of the game enough to know how things work. To it�s credit, the game feels like it�s got weight and physics to everything. Unlike other CODs ( Cold War for example ) where they feel like anything goes. Exaggerated sliding, guns feel like toys more than they do weapons, and the movement feels like you�re controlling an action figure, these are all things I�ve noticed in other CODs. Give Modern Warfare a chance, is very different in terms of feel and it�s realism. But once you master it, it feels like you could go toe- to- toe with Nick Mercs

Sorry for all the edits, Reddit app is bugged so I was blind writing that comment

Also, about the aim assist, try changing your AIM RESPONSE CURVE to Dynamic. Takes just a little bit of getting used to but I felt noticeably better with my shots when I switched to that"
"Practice your aiming on bots before you go into online matches ... test out different iron sights,  scopes and optics ....find a game mode you do best at until you feel comfortable to try others .. knowing when to rush and when to fall back you will get a better feel for it the more you play."
"Your argument is logical, thank you kind redditor."
"Perhaps for a while play more cautiously like perhaps try something like a sniper or marksmen, but also on the gun you use pay attention to the accuracy bar in the gunsmith the higher it is the more bullets will be shot in the center of the screen"
"Sounds logic, thank you."
"maybe try changing your controller layout to something like bumper jumper tactical or similar because it's way better than the default one, also set some personal objectives like grinding a camo or lvling up certain weapons you like. And you can find find joy in this game grinding, playing SnD or playing gunfights.

Ps: I'm also fairly new and I gotta say that that the shooting mechanics in this game somehow made me get better aim (I play on xbox) and I already got some gold camos a lot of max leveled guns and some gold weapons and I just became lvl 200 Prestige 5"
"For aiming just try in local games and switch your sensitivity and ads sensitive as well as magnification sensitivity, try lower sensitivities like around 4 to 6 while ads and hip fire i would encourage 8-10 then move accordingly on how you feel your aim, go lower if you feel it's too much on any of those sensitivities, go higher if you feel that is too slow as well try to change some of the game settings, like what buttons to press to mount your weapons, slide cancell, auto sprinting, auto tactical Sprint. 

Also the maps on this game are kinda ""strategic"" kinda like too campy so you might as well try to play to secure a good spot where you can watch most of the enemy spawn and routes so this way you won't get caught in the fire, also try shoot the ship to find a weapon that suits you. 

My recommendations according to weapons

Ar: Amax/Kilo/M4
Smg: Mp5/Mp7/Fennec
Sniper:Hdr/kar/SPR
Handgun:Renetti/m17"
"I don't have any one tip. I once felt the exact same as you but one day it just ""clicked"" on me and I started improving and most importantly be patient and consciously think about what you could have done better.

Also, if you feel tired of campers then okay hard point and headquarters."
Even if it wasn't for this... S3MM will suck the fun outta the game unfortunately.
"Its SBMM, you play two good match, you gonna get killed so easy. Becuz you gonna get matched against higher skill (whay they say). Just play for fun and dont take it seriously, always have something to counter a specific playstyle, using tactical help you a lot. Try other guns and modes. Give hardcore a try too. Its all about experience. You get better by time."
Yooo I did that once when it was me + him last alive In a S&D game. I think it was the best moment of my life
Yeap... On HC all weapons are viable.
"literally could have done this with the base striker, lol.  its a OHK in hardcore at these ranges"
Someone was using this build in a core match I played and it did the same thing pretty much
will never not be underrated
It's super fun in HC!
It�s amazing how good guns are in a mode that requires 1-3 shots per kill.
"Pistol whip some armor made to be bulletproof and kill the guy wearing it, gotta love CoD logic"

Prolly got banned
"Happened like three times to me. My stats always came back. Sometimes I�d restart my console for it. Later all I had to do was play and everything returned to normal. Except for the time they had some server issues or something, that time I had to wait for that to be resolved."
"I think that�s a shadow ban? I�m not 100% sure tho. I would say try and get ahold of activision support, but they aren�t very helpful. Sorry to hear about the account man, that sucks."
"Yea, I just sent an email but I doubt they'll care. Very depressing."
If it is a shadow ban. It'll be over before you get a response.  Many are 24 hr
"Probably got banned, was your name offensive?"
no it was pretty similar to my username here
"Might want to describe your issue a bit more. You logged in with the same login and password but your MW account is ""wiped""? wiped how, that sounds impossible. The anon thing is just a bug with the name and you can change it back in account settings."
"No my settings are all back to level 1, a full years progress gone."
Sounds like you were hacked. If you lost everything that means someone hijacked your account and unlinked you.
By this you mean your level is gone? Or CPs and bundles gone?
Everything
Fuck Roze All my homies use Yegor
Mother Russia bundle
"I guess Mil Sim? I honestly just use the normal MW operators that aren�t cartoonish. Gaz, Bale, Farah etc etc.

However, I am guilty of buying kitty Mara lol. I rarely use it but it was an impulse buy"
Yup Bale is a phenomenal character and his skins are great
"I�m gonna have to say Mil sim


Shadow company 3 and 2 are the main skins I run followed by Lerch and Pararescue (collation mil sim ) 

And bales FSB skin"
I only missed season 5 and i would love if they added the mw2 shadow company skins as a bundle or something
"What is Tactical Human Charly? It's ""tacti-cool"" IMO, which should probably be a category, but I assume that fits in ""action movie"".

&#x200B;

Purple Cape Iskra is just no category nuttiness, just got it because it looks like Raven from Teen Titans and that's a big, old nostalgia trip."
"I really loved Russian Mil-Sim bundle skins, Azur's Sentinel bundle, Yegor's black leather jacket and Ghost's Azrael. Do I have any of these? No."
"where i live i can buy 2,400 cod points for less than 4 us dollars and i think in Russia its even cheaper. Maybe try using a vpn"
Everyone's voting milsim but playing the game gives away that people love that action movie shit and the silly shit.
"Depends what people count as what. I voted mil-sim because I use the operator edition Otter skin and usually Roze. But some people wouldn't consider those skins ""Mil-sim"" because they aren't the default character mil-sim. 

I see alot more people using these types of skins over the silly shit. The action movie stuff is kind of in the middle which I'm okay with since they aren't so bad."
[deleted]
How many movie referencing skins are are there? I know minotaur has a arnold schwarzenegger outfit from predator and wyatt has a skin related to the glasses and mustache dude from sicario.
"There are a couple more, but with �action movie� i mean skins that are badass or tacti-cool looking and not necessarily realistic. That sicario skin for wyatt is awesome and it�s an awesome movie."
"From the games I played, apparently full black roze lol"
"Aslong as the characters aren't running round in bright pink multi-coloured ugly peices of shit I honestly am not too bothered (I don't mind the cat Mara skin either since it isn't too offensive on the eyes and blends in with some of the other colour schemes). I don't care what the weapon looks like because in screen realestate terms it is hardly noticeable. But when I see a sea of bad ass looking mil-sim/hired ops players then that ugly arse Iskra season 5 skin glowing bright pink from 300m away it make me die inside alittle.

Atleast noones dabbing and nay naying at the end of the match like in BO3."
Agree but when i play a game like bops3 i like goofy and silly stuff cause the game�s unrealistic from base and colorful. On the other hand when i play mw i like to keep it to dark greys black and dark green with realistic operators skins and cammos. I think they should keep these things separate for each game and not mix them. It makes each game better in its own way and style.
The season 3 Mil-Sim skins are still some of the best. USEF and the UK ones are awesome. My only bundle is the Balkan lightning one and I use it almost all the time. Gonna buy frogman when it comes in store too
I use MW2 Ghost and No Russian Yegor
You�re asking a sub that�s typically monolithic when it comes to things like this.
"How is any of Rozes skins ""fortnite""?"
Because it�s similar to the black superhero on fort itw
Favorite of mine is velikan both megalith and woodmen skin
How is Roze skin classify as Fortnite type skin?
[deleted]
The best Domino skin
"Why is roze a fortnite skin? The cold war clown is a fortnite skib, as much as everyone hates roze she's a tactical irl operator. Not some weird circus skin"
"If you find me anyone wearing a gimp-suit without a plate carrier to a military operation with a ballistic mask that has been proven to be ineffective, let me know.

&#x200B;

It's a meme skin that's bordering on pay to win."
"Mil sim and anime. 

Yep.

Bonus points for movie bundles (like the Alien one)"
So you like all of them basically
I only like the roze skin just because it�s tacticool. I am by no means a sweat lol
"If you're on PC, you're not alone, and definitely not doing anything wrong.  This game, honest to god, just gets worse with every update.  *Especially* after Warzone and Cold War dropped.  Heavy freeze spikes in lobby loading, minor freezes *just when respawning,* and sometimes reloading the UI when I move my mouse over a player in the lobby?  My PC's no potato either, with a 7700k and 2080 in it. 

This game just suffers more and more from neglect sadly.  They got our money, they're making more off Warzone, and with their upcoming forced annual release, we're never going to see it get better."
"yeah the thing you said about the minor spawn lag is so true, the other ones I haven�t experienced yet because I only have played for a couple of hours."
"Yeah dude on an ok PC and the spawn lag/freezes happen like half the time now, and never happened before. The lag/freezing when joining lobbies or just doing stuff on the main menu is so much stronger then before too."
"Are you on pc?
Maybe try the verify install in battle net app"
"tried that, but it didn�t work."
"That happened on my old xbox one, also happened when I tried to type in game chat. Doesn�t happen on my series x"
"yeah, it feels like they are degrading the old generations, my friend his ps4 crashes on mw every 1-2 hours which it didn�t do before the ps5 came out. feels like the updates that they brought out put pressure on the older hardware so that people buy new systems."
"You have the desert bloom? It's my favorite blueprint in the game with platinum, I just can't get damascus bc I'm not incredibly patient like you guys lol. I'd just like to see it and Google didn't work"
Yeah i have it I�ll take a picture once I get on.
Desert bloom is hands down my favorite blueprint with Damascus. When I get home it throw a pic up for you.
/u/sebaslmao
Just had it in a match of piccadilly. Tho someone in the chat told him stop and he actually did!
Yeah it�s aids. It�s a stim glitch enabler in Warzone.
I've never seen this until last night. Was getting butt fucked by gas grenades
"Yep. Came across a whole team in search doing it, they just rush planted B and then kept throwing a wall of gas in every direction. Unbelievable that this is the state of the game rn"
"I�ve had it twice today, they just spam throw unlimited gas grenades"
"Last night I went against a guy in Search doing it and he ended up timing out, hopefully he got banned. It�s just obviously cheating and needs to get fixed right away."

Why are we passing this information along
"I'm honestly not sure,so I hope someone can correct me on this. But I believe cod servers are decided by best possible ping in the nearest area. I'm not 100% sure how it works,but I do know that if you have a friend in another country and they are the leader of the party you will play in the server closest to them in their country. It's actually why I only really play cod online and not other MP or online games because it's like the only game that has ever allowed me to play at like 60ping or lower in South Africa,except rocket league which I only found out recently."
"Yeah, that's the thing, I live in Argentina so I'm bound to play in Brazil and I really hate it, tried using VPNs but they seem to be blocked"
"You can use VPN to change servers, but your ping get higher. If you think it worth it, i tell you how, (btw you need PC or Loptop for that if you are on Console)"
"I play in PC, already tried a handful of VPNs but none seem to work, the servers reject the connection."
Try using exit lag. It has a free 3 day trial. You will be able to select server priority. I used it when I was trying to fault find packet loss issues. It does work. It�s just whether you want to pay to play.
Nah they are control freaks
You mean 2 double kills
"Went in firing range with my Xbox controller and was latching onto Mfers like it was no prob. Just hip firing the Kar98 and getting headshots, watching my holo sight bounce onto people. Just felt super cheap."
"This place is pretty quick at announcing its return, so this sub may be it."
"Fair enough, thank you fellow redditor"
"I usually just do a search on this sub for �playlist� and check the most recent threads. I forget the username, but one person usually does a nicely formatted update as of late.

Edit: u/Noctvrnvs is the redditor I was referring to. Just checked and they haven�t put up their playlist post yet, but it�s usually my preferred post because of the formatting."
"Ahh, just did that search and looks like its back at least for this week. Gonna get some hours in this weekend! Thank you fellow redditor."
Is the update live yet?
It's been back for the last two weeks.
Tbh I just want an all black camo with gold lines like that. Looks dope thx for sharing!
No problem bro!
This is why I love the SCAR it always fits with skins
"Lol, Striker and MP7 are my favorite."
"Iso before its first drop off has faster ttk than m4 and after mp5 drop off faster ttk than that. Its by far not the worst. The worst is the striker. I have most smgs obsidian and striker was one of the most frustrating ones. I think I gave up that obs grind twice on it.  

It's so bad it's not even a contest imo.  You can't play it like a smg in the current spr as val and reg meta gun meta.  But its side to side bounce is so bad that you cant play it like an AR either. Even the bizon is better bc of various intangibles like better irons and default mag.  Striker is top class in hc but just really bad in core.  You actually have two drop sbmm brackets to be able to do well with it bc worse opponents gives you more reaction times that the gun needs."
I like the striker but u are very right haha. It�s a neat looking gun tho if you have season 2 blueprint
"I play mostly hardcore search and destroy and the Bizon is my go-to when i'm not using the kar-98. Of the SMG's listed, I rarely see people use the p90."
"Definitely the Bizon, it just feels like a peashooter."
"I dont know why people think the ISO is so bad, use a 30 round magazine, holo sight, and a commando foregrip and it shreds up close and medium"
"It�s one of my favorites too, love that gun"
That means u have real skill. Takes guts to play non meta weapons. Respect
Aug because it acts like ar and it isnt as fast and acurate like the other smgs
"The Fennec is my favorite, honestly"
ISO & Stryker are both worse than the Bizon. Maybe I'm biased since I use the Bizon all the time though.
"Yeah Striker is my favorite gun in this game, idk how u use the bison tho"
">I used to think it was the ISO or Striker, but after getting them gold I think the Striker is decent - you just have to play differently, use it like a mobile-AR. And the ISO is alright - just lacks in a lot of areas, but there's no fatal flaw.

i think you're off base here.  if your argument is to play the Striker like an AR, then that means you have to say the same thing for the Aug which, well, just does better all around than the striker.  it has better hipfire, better mag options, and a better TTK in almost all situations with the 5.56 mag.  it also has lower recoil.  if anything, the Striker leans into being an SMG WAY more than the Aug.  

as for the ISO...its just bad.  you're basically stuck taking a mag option, the irons are terrible, the visual recoil is terrible, its weak at every range, it has a slow reload....its only saving grace is excellent hipfire, but with such a terrible TTK...who cares?  it also has the best ADS movement but....that means you can only take advantage of ONE of its two redeeming features at any given time.  no fatal flaws?  it has the lowest damage of any SMG, with only a marginally faster fire rate than the MP5.

>Now that I have SMGs platinum, I think it's the Bizon. The Bizon has some pretty jarring fatal flaws with range and TTK. It feels like all my kills with the Bizon are from shooting an enemy's back... because I get outgunned when face to face.

if the Bizon's range and TTK is a fatal flaw, then it has to be a flaw for the similarly bad ISO.  at least the PP19 has a good mag size from the jump.

>Lastly, the Fennec is here because I feel there's no way to kit it appropriately. It's a beast close range but once you increase it's laughable range it moves like you're holding a SCAR, and your bullet velocity, recoil, and range are STILL ass. If you don't like to play CQC I can easily see this as being the worst gun in the game.

well uhhh, then dont kit it for range?  you trying to force the gun to be what it's not is the problem, its not the gun's problem.  

kit it for a rusher class and extreme CQC.  then it's great.

if you don't like CQC, then thats on you, not the gun."
"Bruh the fennec has the third best TTK in the entire game. 

It�s not as good as the MP5 but it�s a very solid choice."
"imo the ISO is the weakest, its recoil has a really bad jump on the first shot, its magazine is small by default, and its the slowest killing of the bunch. fennec is prob second worst, kills super fast, but its got a tiny mag, a godawful slow reload, and comparable bullet velocity to the crossbow"
Lol velocity of the crossbow? That�s actually pretty accurate now that you make me think about it
"IMO its between the ISO and the Bizon. Both have terrible ttk, although I think the Bizon feels worse than the ISO. 

I'm surprised the striker is the most voted for. Its got the best smg range and a solid ttk to the chest in its 3 shot kill range. Its definitely not great but I would much rather have my striker class then my bizon or iso classes. 

Fennec is pretty terrible also. It has great cqb ttk potential but at the same time its super slow reload and the BV and large mag attachments that are almost required for it make it's handling too slow to compete with other top tier cqb smgs. Kinda has the handling of a 556 drum mag AUG but without the range bonus that the AUG gets with the 556 conversion."
"The Bizon has the same damage stats as the MP5 with 160 RPM less.

And I disagree re: fennec. It�s not the best gun in the game but it�s definitely top half. It�s 100% not close way better than the Bizon, ISO, Striker, and P90."
"Fennec cause it doesn�t work well for me, though I have managed to get the iso to work REALLY WELL, let me see if I have a video around somewheres !"
The ISO with the FSS Revolution barrel and a monolithic suppressor on it is great. Pair it with a sight and grip of your choice and a 30 round mag and you're golden!
"I would agree with bizon. Even tho it still has its moments like in shipment or something. Its not a bad gun, but probably the worst out of the bunch."
I loved all of them except for Uzi
Don't know how the Striker didn't get more votes than the ISO... The ISO is fucking amazing at long range even with the correct attachments... Got it gold in the forst day I had it. The Striker is pretty meh and I tried using it last week when I unlocked the Bat out of hell blueprint but I just don't like it.
ISO is pretty good after it was buffed a month or so ago.
"For all you heretics out there, here are my 2 secret Shipment Nailgun Supreme builds: 

&#x200B;

1. HPFire: NoStock, 5mW, 12-R ACP, SoH, last is Merc/Stippled
2. ADS: replace 5mW with Tac, 5th slot is up to pref. 

I shit you not, if you have a spammy finger, those 6 bursts can take down 3 people at close ranges. And who tf cares about bullet vel. and range on shitment. 

P.S. Running this in Damascus with EOD perk will tilt any Fire Shotgun users you kill more than twice in a single match."
Nah bro ISO is deadly asf with the right attachments
I think Striker is extremely underpowered.

I can�t remember what skin. I believe speros has a video about it YouTube. And there was a mac10 blueprint that you could buy that had a massive damage spike compared to the regular one. I believe they �patched� it a week or so ago once half a million people bought it.
Bye buddy pal ;)
Late 30s makes you a millenial
"I find myself losing gunfights and pushing the button multiple times in frustration after I die like why didn't it fire!?!?!?!?!?!!?!? It especially happens when an opponent is right in front of me. I think it's netcode related personally. 

Off topic, but also netcode related IMO, is when an opponent jumps, all of a sudden your bullets don't register. I don't care if you're firing at the head or torso, it doesn't matter. Their servers can't handle the information load of one player jumping and another player firing, so it defaults an advantage to the player jumping. Drives me nuts."
Shit i didnt realise it did that! That ecplains so so much as to why I lose so many gun fights to jumping people. Its exhausting because half the time they should be dead and Im here respawning where I should be getting another kill towards a vtol
"Some guns like the magnum and the lmg�s have this implemented on purpose. Remember that if it�s a feature for everybody in the game, then it�s still fair. Frustrating, but fair."
They removed bolt delay to many lmgs as per xclusiveace
"Im using ASRs and SMGs tho and its doing this stuff. It doesnt do it on Cold War. Im literally playing that now and its fine, no delay whatsoever. Just on Modern Warfare"
Input lag? Regular lag? Broken gamepad/keyboard? Are you trying to ADS and shoot at the same time because there�s a buffer for some guns between ADS�ing and when you can shoot
Sprint to fire
"Im already ADS most of the time. Its on any gun and I dont know why. My gamepad isn't broken, it works absolutely brilliantly on other games and the triggers have brilliant sensitivity on other games. Its pretty much just Modern Warfare that I've noticed. I can be holding the button down for like a second and it wont fire and in that time the enemy has already killed me because its hardcore"
"Holy shit does this annoy me.  I dont know if it's mouse input delay or my connection or server connection or something, but it happens, not enough to be able to replicate but too often."
"u/super_lesbian_

Do you have v-sync on?

If you do, turn it off."
I dont know how to check that tbh
"It depends if the gun has any mechanism like an open bolt or a hammer drop, etc.

What weapons are you having the problem with?"
"The only guns I use are the As Val, M4A1, MP5 and Kilo"
nice but dude...  edit. i dont want to see you die three times first
pls

Hopefully it's a fix to whatever's been causing the recent lag spikes and rubberbanding I and others have been experiencing
Its probably stuff for cold war
any of you guys experiencing rubber banding on warzone but cold war runs perfectly smooth? not sure if it�s a hardware problem for my ps5 or not
I hope it adds the new guns
"I hope so too, fingers crossed!"
"when?

i'm not getting any updates.. it says it's up to date... i'm on PC"
Same.
"Don�t know what this dude is on, I never received a MW update either. He probably mistook it for the Cold War one."
"Same problem here.
100 gb+ free space and got the download stuck"
Hope they fix it. I aint downloading no 100 gb update
How big is the update? I�m at work atm :/
I really dont know. The cold war sub says the file is 10 gb but for me its like more than 100gb maybe its bugged
I play on PS4 and its about 11Gb
The download file is bugged for me tho
Playstation users can preload the new warzone update which is reported to be 11gb. Source: CharlieIntel twitter
Wait there�s a new MW update?
Yeh but its only stuff for cw and wz i believe
"Update is 11gb, if you need more than that it's because apparently activision messed up one of their updates and you need to redownload the game. Haven't tried it so idk if it works"
nahhhhhhhhhhhhh i am not redownloading a 140 gb game nahhhhhhhh thats gonna take long
On my PS5 my update is 83gb....wtf???
Its bugged
"Is ""Call of Duty : Warzone"" the official ""tab"" for Modern Warfare?

Edit : Apparently, yes. Why in the actual fuck isn't Warzone a completely separate game/install? Warzone is literally bloated aids at this point."
"Apparently an update bricked a lot of PC�s.  Pay attention to other threads being posted and you may find something.  Sorry it�s not more help :/ 

I�m on xbox but wanted to try to help"
"go to your activision account from activision website using your browser

then go to link accounts and then link your blizzard account to your activision account...

hope that helps"
We all have this teammate
